Fleischman denies he was squatting.

A handyman with experience removing squatters said he tried a new method to help remove Iron Chef winner Adam Fleischman, who was accused by an older woman of living in her home rent-free.

""I basically used the civil process against him,"" Flash Shelton told Fox News.

Fleischman left Oct. 2 after Shelton borrowed a page from squatters' typical playbook. The handyman said he used the threat of a lengthy civil court process to get the unwelcome celebrity chef to leave the home he's occupied since May.

Shelton confronted Fleischman after he moved into Claudia's home, where the chef was living without a lease for about four months before the handyman got involved.

Claudia said she has a medical condition that is exacerbated by stress. Fox News agreed to withhold her last name out of her concern that media attention would affect her health.

""I haven't paid rent because intentionally she wouldn't provide keys or an agreement, etc. etc.,"" the former Iron Chef judge previously told Fox News in a text. ""Landlords or those renting a room have responsibilities.""

Claudia said she allowed Fleischman to move into the home that she is renting with permission of the homeowner. The two initially had an agreement to host pay-per-plate dinner parties to generate income in exchange for living in the Hollywood home with a pleasant view. Claudia initially thought Fleischman, who founded Umami Burger, was a promising partner to work with.

But she said she was never paid for the event or rent. Fleischman, who admits to not paying rent, said he contributed to utilities and ""house expenses.""

ARMY RESERVIST BATTLES SQUATTER LIVING IN HOME AFTER SHE WAS CALLED UP FOR ACTIVE DUTY

Police usually tell landlords or tenants they can't lock a squatter out, according to Shelton. But he recently realized that this is only a warning from police to help avoid civil court cases.

""All the police are doing is saying you can't lock them out, and people are just taking it for that word,"" Shelton said. ""The truth is you can, but the squatters can take you to civil court.""

""The police cannot stop you from locking them out,"" he said.

A past video from Shelton's YouTube channel shows police telling Claudia she could not prevent Fleischman from accessing the home.

SQUATTER VICTIMS FED UP WITH BEING LANDLORDS AFTER FEELING WRONGED BY LEGAL SYSTEM

""The homeowner will usually listen to them like, 'oh my gosh, I can't lock them out' and be scared,"" Shelton added. ""But for me, I just remind them that it's a civil process and that they can excuse themselves.""

According to California's civil code, a landlord can't prevent a tenant from accessing their property or belongings. If they do, they could face a lawsuit from the tenant and be forced to pay attorneys fees in addition to $100 each day the landlord is in violation.

Shelton said he knows this tactic runs the risk of a court battle. But he weighed the risks.

""I'm playing the odds that a squatter is not going to go through hiring an attorney and going through that whole thing just to get into a house that's temporary,"" Shelton said. ""Since the police can't do anything about them, they also can't do anything about me.""

HOW A SQUATTER NEARLY RUINED THIS COUPLE'S WEDDING DAY

Shelton said he threatened Fleischman that he had three days to be out before the doors would be locked. He left after four.

""I told him, 'there is no law to protect you from me,'"" he said. ""I said that 'I can physically go and kick you out, throw your stuff out in the street and lock you out and there's nothing you can do about it.'""

Fleischman called the police who confirmed that the matter would have to be settled in civil court, a video shared with Fox News shows.

""'The whole time you fight in civil court, you have to find a new address because you will not be allowed back in the house,'"" Shelton said he told Fleischman. ""I will do the same thing a squatter does, and I will make sure that that process goes six months, eight months, a year.""

Shelton said Fleischman moved out shortly after the encounter. The Iron Chef winner has not been accused of or charged with any criminal conduct.

FLORIDA VICTIM OF SERIAL SQUATTER CALLS ON DESANTIS TO CRACK DOWN ON ILLEGAL HOME OCCUPATION

""It's amazing how quick somebody will find a place to live when they're afraid they're going to be homeless the next day,"" Shelton said.

""I feel satisfied that Adam is out peacefully, but I'm onto the next squatter situation,"" he added. ""So many elderly men and women fall victim, but ultimately, all ages can easily be taken advantage of by a squatter.""

Fleischman said Claudia is feeling safe in her home again.

""Claudia's first words to me were 'thank you so much, this is the first time I can lock my doors in six months,'"" Shelton said.

The Los Angeles Police Department did not return a request for comment.

Beginning a legal challenge to the Northern Ireland Troubles (Legacy and Reconciliation) Act at Belfast High Court, barrister John Larkin KC also said that a new commission which will take over thousands of unsolved deaths would be the ""only show in town"" for victims but that its architecture was ""inadequate"" and ""defective"".

The Act received royal assent in September despite widespread opposition from political parties, victims' organisations in Northern Ireland and the Irish government.

Aspects of the laws include a limited form of immunity from prosecution for Troubles-related offences for those who co-operate with the new Independent Commission for Reconciliation and Information Recovery (ICRIR).

The new Act will also halt future civil cases and legacy inquests.

The legal challenge, being brought by a number of Troubles victims and heard by Mr Justice Colton, argues that the Act does not comply with human rights law.

Opening the proceedings, Mr Larkin read from the affidavits of a number of Troubles victims whose cases are being heard jointly.

These included the affidavit of Martina Dillon, whose husband Seamus was shot dead in Dungannon in 1997.

The barrister said Mrs Dillon's grief in losing her husband was as raw today as the night he was killed.

Her affidavit said that suspected perpetrators ""can safely sleep at night knowing they will never be held accountable"" as long as the Legacy Act exists.

Mr Larkin said the Troubles had left an ""enormous collective pain"".

He added: ""A pain created by individual events but a pain that is now subject to a form of secondary traumatisation through the provisions in this Act.""

Turning to the individual provisions of the Act, Mr Larkin said if the ICRIR had been created alongside existing structures there might be little to condemn it.

He added: ""But it is the fact that this is an exclusive body, inadequate in its capacities, which extinguishes existing rights, that however imperfectly have been use in an attempt to secure truth and justice.""

The barrister described references in the Act that the ICRIR would promote reconciliation as a form of ""meretricious window dressing"".

But the commission is the only show in town and it is a defective show John Larkin KC

He added: ""If the commission stood alone there might well be complaints one might make about it if one had the faculty of going to the commission instead of seeking an inquest or bringing civil proceedings or criminal proceedings.

""But the commission is the only show in town and it is a defective show, and other shows which have been established to have worked well in the past are closed down.""

Turning to the immunity provisions of the Act, Mr Larkin said the powers would go beyond any immunity powers granted to a public inquiry.

He said: ""All that is required is a truthful, incriminating account.

""There does not have to be any expression, sincere or otherwise of remorse, there does not have to be any acknowledgement of wrongdoing in a moral sense and the account can be accompanied by triumphalism, crowing, by glorification of the criminal act.

""The panel does not have any discretion, any rule for withholding immunity once conditions are met.

""In the context of a measure which is badged as promoting reconciliation, we say the structure for immunity is fundamentally antithetical to any proper approach to reconciliation and actively harms reconciliation.""

Mr Larkin said the Act did not address the suffering of victims, but instead shut it down.

I shouldn't have to be here today to go and fight for truth and justice which I believe I am entitled to Martina Dillon

Speaking before the case started, Mrs Dillon said she hoped the courts would listen to the voices of victims.

She said: ""I am here today to fight for my husband Seamus Dillon and for each and every other victim that needs this law to be changed, and for the courts to please listen and help us.""

""I shouldn't have to be here today to go and fight for truth and justice which I believe I am entitled to.""

Amnesty International, which is supporting the legal challenge, called on the Irish Government to proceed with an inter-state legal case against the legacy laws.

Grainne Teggart said: ""Today's case is hugely significant, not only for the victims challenging this law, but for every Troubles victim having truth and justice cruelly denied to them.

""We repeatedly warned the UK Government during the passage of this legislation that if they pushed this through to law, we would see them in court.

""That is what we are doing here today. Today is day one in the fightback against this law which prioritises perpetrators at the expense of victims' rights.""

She added: ""We call on the Irish Government to swiftly make a decision to take an inter-state case. It is not right that the burden of legal challenge falls solely on the shoulders of victims.

""We note that Leo Varadkar has said in recent days that a decision will be imminent in the coming weeks. We call on them to follow through with their opposition to this law and take that case.""

""The defendant here has taken advantage of administrative stays to engage in targeting of witnesses, as well as prosecutors and their families,"" Smith's team wrote in the 67-page filing.

And the prosecutors urged the appeals court panel to reject Trump's claims that his ability to assail witnesses is protected by the First Amendment. Rather, they said, Trump has knowingly stoked his supporters' fury, prompting a torrent of threats against judges, witnesses, and prosecutors involved in several criminal and civil cases Trump is battling.

""[H]e is implicitly but unmistakably encouraging his supporters ... to act against the very people he targets,"" the prosecutors wrote.

The filing frames the issue ahead of a consequential Nov. 20 oral argument before a three-judge panel of the federal D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals. The judges agreed to temporarily suspend Chutkan's gag order -- and set an expedited timeline to consider the matter -- earlier this month. Trump has repeatedly fundraised off of the gag order, invoked it at political rallies and, while it was suspended, launched attacks against potential witnesses -- like former chief of staff Mark Meadows and former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Mark Milley -- that would have clearly violated the order's terms.

Prosecutors also continued a remarkable string of filings characterizing a former U.S. president as an active threat to the government he again hopes to lead and to the individuals he targets in his social media posts. Prosecutors have repeatedly claimed Trump knowingly provokes violence against his detractors while attempting to maintain deniability about the effect of his words. And in another recent filing -- opposing Trump's call for TV cameras in the federal courtroom where he will stand trial -- prosecutors compared the prominence of Trump's case to three of the most notorious terrorists in American history: 9/11 plotter Zacarias Moussaoui, Oklahoma City bomber Timothy McVeigh and Boston Marathon bomber Dzhokar Tsarnaev. (None of them got cameras in the courtroom despite the national significance of their trials, DOJ argued).

Trump argues that any restriction on his speech would be unconstitutional, particularly as he is hurtling toward the GOP nomination in his 2024 bid for the White House. He argued that Chutkan's order is too vague, putting her in a position to police his speech as the campaign begins in earnest.

But prosecutors say Trump's candidacy is no basis to grant him special treatment that would not be afforded to other criminal defendants, who would never have carte blanche to attack prosecutors by name and drum up anger against participants in the case -- particularly when there is a long, known history of Trump's supporters acting on his invective. They also rejected the notion that the targets of Trump's attacks were not at risk of being intimidated or silenced since many of them are prominent public figures, some of whom have security details.

""[N]o principle of law or logic suggests that law enforcement's ability to take extraordinary measures to ensure the safety of witnesses or court personnel after they have been threatened leaves a court powerless to prevent a criminal defendant from igniting such threats in the first place,"" Smith's team argues.

They also contend that Trump is far from silenced. He has continued to use his prominent social media platform, campaign apparatus and public appearances to mounts attacks on the criminal cases against him, accuse the Biden administration of politically motivated prosecutions and assail the jury pool in Washington, D.C., all of which they say are permitted under Chutkan's gag order.","{'uri': 'politico.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'POLITICO'}",[],https://static.politico.com/0b/ba/bf97f73449178a93d56f52d71dff/ufc-295-mixed-martial-arts-58604.jpg,eng-9065743,-0.07450980392156858,76,76,POLITICO,politico.com

Dale Semper, 41, from Enfield, north London, was left in turmoil for two years after he was suspended from his £72,000-a-year role with Lloyds Bank whilst the force investigated him. Following a decision at the High Court, the case is set to go to trial in front of a civil court judge in light of the racial discrimination claim.

Mr Semper, alongside his HR manager partner, Denise Huggan, and his mum Linnette Semper, who has worked for the NHS for 20 years, are claiming damages for ""lost earnings, psychological damage, false imprisonment, trespass and discrimination"". The trio said they were subjected to humiliation after their home was searched by the police.

The bank manager and his partner said they were stopped by cops as he drove her to a train station in August 2017. Officers told him to get out of the car and arrested him despite him saying that they had cuffed the ""wrong guy."" Police then drove him back to his home, which was searched, whilst Mr Semper stood embarrassed in handcuffs outside of the property. Mr Semper was staggered when he learnt that the officers were searching for guns in his house, and also rocked when they subsequently - having found no firearms - told him he was being instead being investigated for money laundering. It was only in October 2019 that he was informed over the phone that the investigation was being dropped and that no further action would be taken.

During his two-year ordeal, Mr Semper went through the indignity of having his bank accounts frozen and had to account for all the cash he spent and earned in exhaustive detail. Mr Semper is suing the Met on multiple grounds - including racial discrimination, false imprisonment, malicious prosecution, misfeasance and breach of data protection. He claims he was singled out by police due to skewed ""racial profiling"", although this is flatly denied by the Met, which insists it had ""reasonable and probable cause"" for all its officers' actions.

The force says it was acting on intelligence and, although it did not lead to a prosecution, it was justified in investigating.

During an earlier hearing, Mr Semper's barrister Adam Wagner revealed that the ""high value"" case could be worth around £1 million to him and his family. ""Mr Semper has plateaued in what was previously a high-flying career as a bank manager,"" he said during the hearing. ""The police appear to have called up his employer and told them they believed he was involved in people smuggling. That led to his employer taking all sorts of actions which we say they otherwise wouldn't have taken. We say the police can't go around telling everybody what is being alleged. There has got to be proportionality.""

He said the case includes a substantial loss of earnings claim, particularly for Mr Semper, who he said was a ""well-paid and relatively young bank employee who has suffered a serious and potentially longterm psychiatric injury as a result of the alleged unlawful actions of the police."" But Mr Wagner said that, as well as money, the family want answers as to why ""a black man - a businessman and successful bank manager - would be put through what he was put through"".

Lawyers for the Met deny all liability and say the £1m claim against them is ""aspirational and enthusiastic,"" suggesting Mr Spencer's career path would have flattened out anyway. The case reached court after an application by Mr Semper and his family for his trial to go before a jury. Setting out their case during his ruling on the application, Judge Southey said: ""The claimants rely on the importance of the issues raised by the claim as supporting the application. In issue are allegations of the abuse of police powers. In particular, it is said there were racist motives in the actions of the police. That is said to be a matter of national interest in light of concerns about institutional racism in the Met.""

The Met contested the application, arguing that the important issues would be better decided by a judge, who - unlike a jury - would be able to give a ""reasoned judgment"" setting out detailed findings. The judge continued: ""It appears to me that the significant issues of racism that are raised by this case are matters that weigh against a jury trial. It is important that there is a reasoned judgment. That will allow the claimants and the public to understand precisely what findings have been made about a highly sensitive issue and an issue where there is legitimate public interest. In light of that I have concluded that I should decline to exercise my discretion to order a jury trial."" The case will go before a judge at Central London County Court, sitting with the assistance of a specialist assessor, skilled and experienced in discrimination issues. The assessor will help the judge evaluate the factual evidence at the trial, but will not make any decisions which decide the outcome of the trial. No date has been set for the trial.","{'uri': 'mirror.co.uk', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'Mirror'}","[{'uri': 'paul_keogh@mirror.co.uk', 'name': 'Paul Keogh', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': False}, {'uri': 'monica_charsley@mirror.co.uk', 'name': 'Monica Charsley', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': False}]",https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article31455953.ece/alternates/s1200/0_pay-dalesemper2.jpg,eng-9068783,-0.5529411764705883,56,56,Mirror,mirror.co.uk

Harry had been involved in six legal battles at the High Court in recent months, including cases brought against Mirror Group Newspapers (MGN), Associated Newspapers Limited (ANL) and News Group Newspapers (NGN) over allegations of unlawful information gathering.

The duke's civil litigation has also included legal challenges against the Home Office linked to the provision of his personal security.

With a judgment over the future of the duke's unlawful information gathering claim against ANL due on Friday, here is an overview of the current status of his cases:

- Unlawful information gathering allegations against ANL

Harry is one of seven high-profile people, including Sir Elton John and Baroness Lawrence of Clarendon, bringing legal action against the publisher of the Daily Mail over allegations it carried out or commissioned unlawful information gathering.

The ""firmly"" denied allegations against ANL include the hiring of private investigators to place listening devices inside cars, the ""blagging"" of private records and the accessing and recording of private phone conversations.

The Duke of Sussex made a surprise appearance at the Royal Courts Of Justice earlier this year in a hearing in his claim against Associated Newspapers Limited (James Manning/PA)

At a preliminary hearing in March, the publisher asked a judge to rule in its favour without a trial, arguing the legal challenges against it were brought ""far too late"".

The duke made a surprise appearance at the Royal Courts of Justice in London for the March proceedings, where his lawyers argued that those bringing legal action were ""thrown off the scent"" and not aware of being targeted, having believed ""categorical denials"" from ANL over any involvement in unlawful activity.

Mr Justice Nicklin's ruling over whether the cases can continue is due on Friday.

- Allegations of unlawful information gathering at NGN

Harry and actor High Grant are suing NGN, publisher of The Sun and the now-defunct News Of The World, over alleged unlawful information gathering.

The duke alleges he was targeted by journalists and private investigators working for the papers.

Hugh Grant is joining Harry in suing News Group Newspapers over allegations of unlawful information gathering (James Manning/PA)

At a preliminary hearing in April, the publisher asked a judge to throw out his and Mr Grant's claim, arguing they were brought too late.

But Mr Justice Fancourt later ruled that Harry and the actor's claims could go to trial, except for any allegations relating to phone hacking.

The judge also refused to allow the duke to rely on an alleged ""secret agreement"" between the royal family and senior executives working for media mogul Rupert Murdoch as part of his claim.

Harry's lawyers had argued that NGN's challenge to his claim was an attempt to go behind the alleged agreement, which they said had prevented him from bringing his case.

NGN, which denies any unlawful activity took place at The Sun, disputed that such an agreement was in place.

Harry's claim is set to go to trial in January 2025.

- Unlawful information gathering claim against MGN

In a rare royal event, Harry entered a High Court witness box in the trial of his damages claim against the publisher of the Daily Mirror, the Sunday Mirror and Sunday People.

The world's media descended on a courtroom in London to see the duke give evidence across two days in his contested claim against MGN over allegations its journalists were linked to voicemail interception, securing information through deception and hiring private investigators for unlawful activities.

His case, alongside those of former Coronation Street actress Nikki Sanderson, comedian Paul Whitehouse's ex-wife, Fiona Wightman, and actor Michael Turner, known professionally as Michael Le Vell, were considered as ""test cases"" at a seven-week trial held this summer.

MGN largely contested the claims and denied that any of the articles complained of resulted from phone hacking, while contending that the vast majority did not arise from any other unlawful activity.

Mr Justice Fancourt is expected to give his ruling over the case at a later date.

- Challenge against the Home Office over UK security arrangements

In July last year, Harry secured a judge's permission to pursue legal action against the Home Office over security arrangements for himself and his family when they are in the UK.

The duke is challenging a February 2020 decision of the Executive Committee for the Protection of Royalty and Public Figures (Ravec) - which falls under the remit of the department - after being told he would no longer be given the ""same degree"" of personal protective security when visiting.

Harry's lawyers say the security arrangements set out by Ravec, and their application when he visited the UK in June 2021, were invalid due to ""procedural unfairness"" because he was not given an opportunity to make ""informed representations beforehand"".

The Home Office says Ravec was entitled to reach the decision it did, which is that Harry's security arrangements will be considered on a case-by-case basis.

Mr Justice Swift said part of Harry's case could proceed, with a date for a full hearing yet to be set.

- Second case against Home Office in relation to UK security

In May, a High Court judge rejected Harry's bid to bring a further legal challenge against the department over a Ravec decision that he should not be allowed to pay privately for his protective security.

The Home Office, which opposed Harry's claim, said Ravec considered it was ""not appropriate"" for wealthy people to ""buy"" protective security, which might include armed officers, when it had decided that ""the public interest does not warrant"" someone receiving such protection on a publicly funded basis.

The duke's legal team argued Ravec's view, that allowing payment for protective security would be contrary to the public interest and undermine public confidence in the Metropolitan Police, could not be reconciled with rules which expressly permit charging for certain police services.

Mr Justice Chamberlain refused Harry permission to bring the second challenge on May 23.

- Libel claim over Mail on Sunday article on Home Office legal battle

Harry is also suing Associated Newspapers Limited (ANL) over a February 2022 Mail on Sunday article about his legal fight with the Home Office.

The story was published online and in the newspaper under the headline ""Exclusive: How Prince Harry tried to keep his legal fight with the government over police bodyguards a secret ... then - just minutes after the story broke - his PR machine tried to put a positive spin on the dispute"".

The duke's lawyers in his libel claim have said the articles ""purported to reveal, in sensational terms"" that information from court documents filed by the duke ""contradicted public statements he had previously made about his willingness to pay for police protection for himself and his family whilst in the UK"".

ANL is contesting the claim, arguing the article expressed an ""honest opinion"" and did not cause ""serious harm"" to Harry's reputation.

At a preliminary hearing in March, the High Court heard the duke's bid to strike out ANL's ""honest opinion"" defence or grant judgment in his favour on it.

A ruling from Mr Justice Nicklin is expected this year.","{'uri': 'dailymail.co.uk', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'Daily Mail Online'}",[],https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2023/11/10/02/wire-77635289-1699584539-68_636x382.jpg,eng-9049271,-0.03529411764705881,56,56,Daily Mail Online,dailymail.co.uk

Case in point, the Duke of Sussex spent part of this week in court as part of a larger lawsuit against Mirror Group Newspapers (MGN), publisher of the Daily Mirror, the Sunday Mirror and the Sunday People tabloids. Harry and his fellow plaintiffs are arguing the newspapers illegally violated their privacy via means like phone hacking. But while Harry's testimony was historic -- he was ""the first British royal to appear in the witness box since the 1890s,"" according to Reuters -- opposing counsel called it ""extraordinary"" for very different reasons. (MGN has previously admitted to hacking other individuals, eventually settling hundreds of cases, but its legal team denies Harry was ever a victim.)

The judge, Sir Timothy Fancourt, directed the duke to be in court in London on June 5, just in case the parties' statements finished early and his testimony could then begin early. But Harry did not appear in court, putting attorney David Sherborne in the unenviable position of having to account for his client's absence.

Sherborne informed the court that Harry would be ""attending tomorrow"" because ""he flew yesterday evening from Los Angeles."" It was likely as unconvincing an argument in a London courtroom as it would have been in an American one. Was Harry physically in London, but jetlagged? The lawyers did not exactly clarify. But the episode seemed to add to the overall impression that Harry perhaps expected special treatment in the Royal Courts of Justice.

And why did Harry take a flight that would possibly make him late for court? According to Sherborne: ""He was attending his daughter's birthday.""

Not a great excuse. And not a great start for Harry, either.

In U.S. courts, criminal defendants generally must be at all hearings, proceedings, and, of course, trial. They have a constitutional right to be present. If that right is denied, it can be grounds to overturn a conviction. The rules are not the same for civil cases, though. A plaintiff in civil court, like Harry in the U.K., doesn't have to be present during the entire trial. In fact, some plaintiffs' attorneys think it can help the client to be strategically, periodically absent from trial.

In a recent Utah civil case, optometrist Terry Sanderson sued movie star Gwyneth Paltrow for injuries alleged in a skiing accident. Sanderson was not present every day of the trial, though he had a right to be there. There's a good chance that his legal team wanted the jury to think his injuries were so severe that he couldn't be comfortable for long stretches in court. Perhaps Sanderson's lawyers were worried that their client would look too healthy to the jury if they saw him every day. Or maybe they just would notice things they didn't like about him. Whatever the strategy was, however, Sanderson still lost.

In any case, by U.S. civil court standards, it's not the end of the world for a plaintiff to only be present for part of the trial. This would especially be the case with someone as high profile as Harry. A celebrity plaintiff or defendant can make the courthouse an unpleasant place, with delays and increased security. It might help a superstar plaintiff's case if he only showed up occasionally to his own trial.

But Harry didn't just skip a day of someone else's testimony, he was late for his own proposed testimony. As a witness. After the judge told him to be there. It doesn't appear that Harry will be sanctioned for blowing off his first day. Frankly, I wouldn't want to be the judge to have to consider sanctioning a royal, when the title of my court, and the name on the building, includes the word ""royal.""

Generally, it's difficult to grade a witness's testimony from anywhere but inside the courtroom. But according to reports of the duke's testimony, he focused on the alleged harm done to him by the defendants. It's possible that this testimony falls flat with commoners who are not rich celebrities. But even if the prince was allegedly harmed by the defendants' conduct, that's only half the battle. He has to prove that the defendants did something wrong.

Harry has a lot of theories about how the defendants may have obtained information about him. But so far, it's mostly speculation. On cross-examination, the emotional toll of years of negative British press coverage seemed clear. Less so were the specific stories and reports that may have contributed to that toll. In other words, his legal team likely had their work cut out for him. Because Harry may well have been hurt, but he may not have proven that the people he sued wrongfully hurt him.","{'uri': 'msnbc.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'MSNBC.com'}",[],"https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_nbcnews-fp-1024-512,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2023-06/230608-prince-harry-al-1334-c714b1.jpg",,-0.2470588235294118,55,55,MSNBC.com,msnbc.com

Trump are preparing to populate a new administration with a more aggressive breed of right-wing lawyer, dispensing with traditional conservatives who they believe stymied his agenda in his first term.

The allies have been drawing up lists of lawyers they view as ideologically and temperamentally suited to serve in a second Trump administration. Their aim is to reduce the chances that politically appointed lawyers would frustrate a more radical White House agenda -- as they sometimes did when Mr. Trump was in office, by raising objections to his desires for certain harsher immigration policies or for greater personal control over the Justice Department, among others.

Now, as Trump allies grow more confident in an election victory next fall, several outside groups, staffed by former Trump officials who are expected to serve in senior roles if he wins, have begun parallel personnel efforts. At the start of Mr. Trump's term, his administration relied on the influential Federalist Society, the conservative legal network whose members filled key executive branch legal roles and whose leader helped select his judicial nominations. But in a striking shift, Trump allies are building new recruiting pipelines separate from the Federalist Society.

These back-room discussions were described by seven people with knowledge of the planning, most of whom spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe private conversations. In addition, The New York Times interviewed former senior lawyers in the Trump administration and other allies who have remained close to the president and are likely to serve in a second term.

The interviews reveal a significant break within the conservative movement. Top Trump allies have come to view their party's legal elites -- even leaders with seemingly impeccable conservative credentials -- as out of step with their movement.

""The Federalist Society doesn't know what time it is,"" said Russell T. Vought, a former senior Trump administration official who runs a think tank with close ties to the former president. He argued that many elite conservative lawyers had proved to be too timid when, in his view, the survival of the nation is at stake.

Such comments may surprise those who view the Federalist Society as hard-line conservatives. But the move away from the group reflects the continuing evolution of the Republican Party in the Trump era and an effort among those now in his inner circle to prepare to take control of the government in a way unseen in modern presidential history.

Two of the allies leading the push are Stephen Miller, Mr. Trump's former senior adviser, and John McEntee, another trusted aide whom the then-president had empowered in 2020 to rid his administration of political appointees perceived as disloyal or obstructive.

The nonprofit groups they are involved in are barred by law from supporting a candidate, and none of the work they are doing is explicitly tied to Mr. Trump. But Mr. Miller and Mr. McEntee remain close to the former president and are expected to have his ear in any second term.

Mr. Trump himself, focused for now on multiple criminal and civil cases against him, appears disengaged from these efforts. But he made clear throughout his term in office that he was infuriated by many of the lawyers who worked for him, ranting about how they were ""weak"" and ""stupid.""

By the end of his term, lawyers he appointed early in his administration had angered the White House by raising legal concerns about various policy proposals. But Mr. Trump reserved his deepest rage for the White House and Justice Department legal officials who largely rejected his attempts to overturn the 2020 election, according to people who spoke with him. Casting about for alternative lawyers who would tell him what he wanted to hear, Mr. Trump turned for that effort to a group of outside lawyers, many of whom have since been indicted in Georgia.

People close to the former president say they are seeking out a different type of lawyer committed to his ""America First"" ideology and willing to endure the personal and professional risks of association with Mr. Trump. They want lawyers in federal agencies and in the White House who are willing to use theories that more establishment lawyers would reject to advance his cause. This new mind-set matches Mr. Trump's declaration that he is waging a ""final battle"" against demonic ""enemies"" populating a ""deep state"" within the government that is bent on destroying America.

There were a few lawyers like that in Mr. Trump's administration, but they were largely outnumbered, outranked and often blocked by more traditional legal conservatives. For those who went to work for Mr. Trump but grew disillusioned, the push to systematically install Trump loyalists who may see the law as malleable across a second Trump administration has been a cause for alarm.

John Mitnick was appointed by Mr. Trump as general counsel of the Homeland Security Department in 2018. But he was fired in 2019 as part of a broad purge of the agency's leaders -- whom Mr. Trump had installed -- and was replaced by one of Mr. Miller's allies.

Mr. Mitnick predicted that ""no qualified attorneys with integrity will have any desire to serve as political appointees"" in a second Trump term, and that instead it would be ""predominantly staffed by opportunists who will rubber-stamp whatever Trump and his senior White House staff want to do.""

In many ways, the Federalist Society has become synonymous with the Republican establishment, and its members' most common interests -- including pushing an originalist interpretation of the Constitution and federal statutes -- can be distinct from the whims and grievances of Mr. Trump himself. Its membership dues are low, and politically ambitious Republican lawyers of various stripes routinely join it or attend its events. Many of the more aggressive lawyers the Trump allies are eyeing have their own links to it.

But after both the legal policy fights inside the Trump administration and the refusal by the group's most respected luminaries to join Mr. Trump's efforts to overturn the 2020 election, the phrase ""Federalist Society"" became a slur for some on the Trump-aligned right, a shorthand for a kind of lawyerly weakness.

Hard-right allies of Mr. Trump increasingly speak of typical Federalist Society members as ""squishes"" too worried about maintaining their standing in polite society and their employment prospects at big law firms to advance their movement's most contentious tactics and goals.

""Trump and his administration learned the hard way in their first term that the Democrats are playing for keeps,"" said Mike Davis, a former congressional aide who helped shepherd judicial nominees during the Trump administration and has become a close ally of the 45th president. ""And in the Trump 47 administration, they need much stronger attorneys who do not care about elite opinion who will fight these key cultural battles.""

A Fraught Union

When Mr. Trump wrested the 2016 Republican presidential nomination from the party's old guard, it was unclear whether social conservatives would turn out in the general election to vote for a thrice-married New Yorker who had cultivated a playboy reputation and once described himself as ""very pro-choice."" But Mr. Trump won their support by essentially striking a deal with legal conservatives: He agreed to fill Supreme Court vacancies from a list of prospects compiled by a small number of movement stalwarts.

This group helping to shape the judiciary included Leonard A. Leo -- arguably the most powerful figure in the conservative legal movement and a leader of the Federalist Society -- and Donald F. McGahn II, Mr. Trump's 2016 campaign general counsel and first White House counsel. With a seat already open after the death of Justice Antonin Scalia, the move worked: Exit polls showed that court-focused voters helped secure Mr. Trump's narrow victory.

Along with the Republican leader in the Senate, Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, Mr. Leo and Mr. McGahn -- and later Pat A. Cipollone, Mr. Trump's second White House counsel -- created an assembly line for turning Federalist Society-style lawyers into appeals court judges and Supreme Court justices.

But the union between Mr. Trump and the conservative legal establishment could be more fraught than it sometimes appeared. As his presidency wore on, Mr. Trump attacked and sidelined many of the lawyers around him. That included Mr. Leo.

One episode, described by a person familiar with the incident, illustrates the larger chill.

In January 2020, Mr. Leo was having dinner at Mar-a-Lago when Mr. Trump strode up to his table. The president stunned Mr. Leo, publicly berating him and accusing him of recommending the deputy attorney general, Rod J. Rosenstein, who appointed a special counsel to investigate ties between the Russian government and the Trump campaign.

Taken aback, Mr. Leo protested that he had actually suggested someone else for the position -- Mr. Cipollone. Mr. Trump walked away without apologizing.

Nearly a year later, when Mr. Trump was trying to enlist legal assistance for his efforts to overturn his 2020 election loss, he reached out three times to Mr. Leo. But Mr. Leo declined to take or return Mr. Trump's calls, and has since only dealt with him through others.

A spokesman for Mr. Trump did not respond to repeated requests for comment.

In a statement, Mr. Leo said, ""I have nothing to say regarding his current efforts, but I'm just grateful that President Trump transformed the Supreme Court and the federal judiciary in his first term.""

Mr. Mitnick's experience underscores the style of lawyering that Trump allies saw as too cautious. His role as the top lawyer at the Department of Homeland Security put him in the path of increasingly aggressive policy proposals from a top White House adviser to Mr. Trump, Mr. Miller.

Mr. Miller, who is not a lawyer, is known for his vehement opposition to immigration. Mr. Mitnick and Mr. Miller are said to have clashed, directly and indirectly, over legal risks raised by regulatory and policy actions emanating from the White House, including separating migrant children from their parents and transporting migrants to so-called sanctuary cities.

In 2019, the White House purged the leadership ranks of the Homeland Security Department, firing Mr. Mitnick. Mr. Trump ultimately installed as his replacement Chad Mizelle, who had been out of law school just seven years but was a close Miller ally.

Like numerous other positions filled later in Mr. Trump's term, Mr. Mizelle was appointed as ""acting"" general counsel, sidestepping a Senate vetting and confirmation process that would most likely have closely scrutinized whether he was qualified for the job.

With Mr. Mizelle acting as the department's top lawyer when the Covid-19 pandemic arose, the Trump administration seamlessly invoked emergency powers to flatly refuse to consider the petition of any asylum seeker arriving at the southern border.

Seeking 'America First' Lawyers

Mr. Miller has stayed close to Mr. Trump and is expected to play an even more important role in shaping policy if Mr. Trump returns to power.

While out of office, Mr. Miller has been running a foundation focused on suing the Biden administration and recruiting a new generation of ""America First"" lawyers, with some from attorney general and solicitor general offices in Texas and other Republican-controlled states. ""America First"" Republicans are often opposed to both legal and illegal immigration, protectionist on trade and skeptical of international alliances and military intervention overseas.

One first-term Trump lawyer who would most likely serve in a second term is Mark Paoletta, who served as general counsel at the Office of Management and Budget and worked closely with Mr. Vought, the agency's director. The O.M.B. team saw itself as an island of facilitators within an executive branch they believed was too quick to tell Mr. Trump that his ideas were unachievable or illegal.

Together, Mr. Vought and Mr. Paoletta came up with the idea of having Mr. Trump declare a national emergency and invoke special powers to spend more taxpayer money on a border wall than Congress was willing to appropriate.

Mr. Paoletta also believed that Mr. Trump could have exerted greater personal control over the Justice Department, although Mr. Paoletta said in an interview that he did not advocate using the presidency's command over federal law enforcement for partisan and personal score-settling. He and other advisers likely to follow Mr. Trump back into power view White House authority to direct the Justice Department as proper under the so-called unitary executive theory. It holds that presidents can directly command the entire federal bureaucracy and that pockets of independent decision-making authority are unconstitutional.

""I believe a president doesn't need to be so hands-off with the D.O.J.,"" Mr. Paoletta said, adding: ""It's not an independent agency, and he is the head of the executive branch. A president has every right to direct D.O.J. to look at items that are his policy priorities and other matters of national importance.""

Mr. Trump is not known for pondering legal philosophy. But he has found common cause with lawyers who have a sweeping view of presidential power.

In his 2024 campaign, Mr. Trump has promised to ""appoint a real special prosecutor to go after"" President Biden and his family -- shattering the post-Watergate norm of Justice Department independence. More than any legal policy statement on his campaign website, retribution may be the closest thing to a governing philosophy for Mr. Trump as he seeks a second term.

'Legal Creativity'

Mr. Trump has rarely looked closely at a lawyer's area of specialty. Instead, he has often looked at whether a particular lawyer can help him gain something he wants. He spent much of his first term railing against the lawyers who worked for him and wondering aloud why none of them could live up to the memory of his notoriously ruthless mentor, Roy Cohn, who represented Mr. Trump in his early business career in New York.

When he sought to overturn the 2020 election, Mr. Trump was unsatisfied with his government lawyers, including his second White House counsel, Mr. Cipollone, who largely rejected his efforts to subvert the results. Mr. Trump turned to a different set of outside lawyers.

Those lawyers included Rudolph W. Giuliani, John C. Eastman, Kenneth Chesebro, Jenna Ellis and Sidney K. Powell, all of whom have since been indicted in Georgia in a racketeering case that charged the former president and 18 of his allies with conspiring to overturn his election loss there in 2020. Ms. Powell, Mr. Chesebro and Ms. Ellis have pleaded guilty.

Mr. Trump was also infuriated that the justices he had put on the Supreme Court declined to repay his patronage by intervening in the 2020 election. As Mr. Trump criticized the court, Mr. Leo with the Federalist Society is said to have told associates he was disappointed that the former president's rhetoric made his judicial appointment record look ""transactional,"" aimed at advancing Mr. Trump's personal interests rather than a broader philosophical mission.

In the same way, Mr. Trump had a falling-out with his attorney general, William P. Barr, who refused to falsely say that the Justice Department had evidence of widespread voter fraud. After Mr. Barr resigned, his deputy and successor, Jeffrey A. Rosen, also refused to throw the department's weight behind Mr. Trump's claims. Mr. Trump then explored the idea of installing Jeffrey Clark -- an official who was willing to raise concerns about purported election fraud -- as acting attorney general.

Mr. Clark has also been indicted in the Georgia case, but remains in favor with Mr. Trump and has met with the former president at his private clubs. Over the summer, at Mr. Trump's golf club in Bedminster, N.J., Mr. Clark attended a fund-raiser for the people who have been imprisoned for rioting at the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021.

Mr. Clark will most likely be in contention for a senior Justice Department position in any second Trump administration, depending on the outcome of his legal travails. He has written a constitutional analysis, titled ""The U.S. Justice Department Is Not Independent,"" that amounts to an intellectual blueprint for direct presidential control of federal law enforcement.

He declined to comment. On a conservative podcast last year, Mr. Clark said that ""extraordinary times call for extraordinary, responsive legal creativity.""","{'uri': 'nytimes.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'The New York Times'}","[{'uri': 'charlie_savage@nytimes.com', 'name': 'Charlie Savage', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': False}, {'uri': 'maggie_haberman@nytimes.com', 'name': 'Maggie Haberman', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': False}]",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2023/10/30/multimedia/00pol-trump-2025-lawyers-jhwt/00pol-trump-2025-lawyers-jhwt-videoSixteenByNine3000.jpg,eng-9018094,0.1764705882352942,55,55,The New York Times,nytimes.com

That's beginning to test...,"NEW YORK (AP) - Donald Trump isn´t used to constraints.

The former president ignores and antagonizes anyone who tells him no. He built a business - and later political - brand as someone who says and does what he wants, largely without consequence. Even after losing the White House, Trump remains accustomed to deference, surrounded by people who greet him with nightly standing ovations at his clubs and cheer his most outrageous lies.

But Trump came face-to-face with a new reality Wednesday when he was called to the witness stand and fined $10,000 for violating a gag order prohibiting him from attacking court personnel in his New York civil fraud case. Trump denied he was referring to a senior law clerk when he told reporters in the courthouse hallway that someone ""sitting alongside"" Judge Arthur Engoron was ""perhaps even much more partisan than he is.""

Engoron wasn't having it.

""I find that the witness is not credible,"" he concluded before issuing the fine. Minutes later, Trump stormed out of the courtroom in an apparent fit of anger.

The $10,000 holds little financial consequence for a wealthy defendant who flew to his appearance aboard a private jet.

But the courtroom drama previews the tensions mounting between Trump´s competing legal and political interests as he vies for the Republican presidential nomination while facing a litany of criminal and civil cases. And it underscores how efforts to hold Trump accountable are testing the legal system in unprecedented ways as judges struggle with how to rein in the former president´s inflammatory rhetoric while balancing the free speech rights of a political candidate.

""It´s really a new frontier for the legal system, and the legal system is really struggling with how to control this man who has no respect for the rule of law,"" said Jimmy Gurule, a Notre Dame law school professor.

The court system has never encountered this type of defendant. Trump is not only a former president, but also the leading candidate for the 2024 Republican presidential nomination. He has turned his legal fights into a centerpiece of his campaign while also painting himself as the victim of coordinated political persecution.

Lawyers typically tell criminal defendants to stay quiet, knowing prosecutors can use any utterance against them. But Trump has turned the camera-lined hallway outside the courtroom into his own personal campaign stage, holding impromptu press conferences multiple times a day as he enters and exits the room. He also broadcasts his grievances on his social media platform, where he regularly slams Engoron as ""a Radical Left Democrat"" controlled by New York Attorney General Letitia James ""and her Thugs.""

Gurule said courts are hamstrung in trying to punish Trump the way they would normal defendants because of his position and personal wealth. A $10,000 fine is unlikely to deter someone as rich as Trump. And while Engoron floated the possibility of holding Trump ""in contempt of court, and possibly imprisoning him"" for further violations, jailing an ex-president who is under Secret Service protection would present enormous logistical challenges, in addition to the grave political implications of putting a leading political candidate behind bars.

The absence of meaningful consequences raises questions about whether Trump's prominence has allowed him to exist under a ""different standard of law"" than other defendants, Gurule said.

Indeed, fines and the threat of jail haven´t deterred Trump yet. Just days ago, he was fined $5,000 for violating the same gag order, which Engoron imposed after Trump targeted his principal law clerk on social media. While Trump immediately deleted the post, the court later learned that a copy remained posted on his campaign website, which his attorneys called an unintentional oversight.

But Trump, so far, has capitalized politically on his trials, plastering his mugshot on merchandise that has brought in millions of dollars and fundraising off every development. Trump fretted last week that his appearances in court weren't drawing as much media attention with the spotlight turned to the war in the Middle East and the House speakership debacle. But with the latest courtroom drama, he was once again making headlines, overshadowing his rivals and filling his campaign coffers.

""For some people, this is what they like about Trump - that he doesn´t back down, he pushes against others and he is his own master. But in the world of the courts, the rules are different,"" said Laurie Levenson, a former federal prosecutor and professor at Loyola Law School.

While Trump's tactics may have political benefits, they could also help prosecutors argue the former president believes he´s above the law.

""If he disregards orders of the court, then it may add to the argument that he was disregarding other laws as well,"" she said.

""By his actions, he´s messaging that the laws don´t apply to me. And that´s problematic because a good prosecutor - and I think Jack Smith is a good prosecutor - can use that at the right time against him,"" Levenson said, referring to the special prosecutor overseeing the federal cases against Trump.

Indeed, things are likely to get much more complicated for Trump in the coming months as his four criminal trials get underway. While the New York fraud case is a civil trial at which Trump has appeared voluntarily, he is likely to face far tougher restrictions and harsher punishments in his criminal cases.

In 2017, a federal judge in Brooklyn revoked the bail of pharmaceutical company CEO Martin Shkreli, who had been convicted of fraud, and sent him to jail after he went on social media and offered a $5,000 bounty to anyone who could get him a strand of Democrat Hillary Clinton´s hair. Shkreli´s lawyers said he was just joking, but the judge called that offer ""a solicitation of an assault.""

More recently, a federal judge in Manhattan revoked the bail of former cryptocurrency mogul Sam Bankman-Fried while he awaited trial on fraud charges after he gave journalists copies of the private writings of his former girlfriend, who was set to testify against him at a trial. The judge ruled that amounted to witness tampering.

Trump has so far seemed to abide by a separate gag order imposed by the judge overseeing his 2020 election interference criminal case in Washington. Trump has decried the order, which barred him from making public statements targeting prosecutors, court staff and potential witnesses, as unconstitutional and is appealing. But he waited until it was temporarily lifted Friday to resume his public attacks against Smith and label those who have made cooperation deals with prosecutors ""weaklings and cowards.""

Prosecutors asked late Wednesday for the gag order to be reinstated, citing recent social media posts about Trump´s former chief of staff that they said represented an attempt to influence and intimidate him.

Trump has also avoided inflammatory remarks against Judge Aileen Cannon, who is overseeing the case into his alleged hoarding of classified documents at his Mar-a-Lago club, and whom he appointed.

In a typical court proceeding, a judge would likely be more concerned about whether a defendant has blatantly broken court rules, like trying to speak to jurors or threatening witnesses, than stray comments made outside of court about feeling like court personnel are biased. But Trump has an unparalleled megaphone, making his message potentially more dangerous at a time when judges are increasingly under threat.

The judge in Trump´s hush-money criminal case, Juan Manuel Merchan, received dozens of death threats around the time of Trump´s arraignment in April after the former president lashed out at him on social media. New York court officials have beefed up security for judges and court personnel involved in Trump matters in the wake of the threats.

""In the current overheated climate, incendiary untruths can, and in some cases already have, led to serious physical harm, and worse,"" Engoron said upon fining Trump on Friday.

In the early days of their partnership De Niro would often yell at him out of anger and frustration, Mr Harvey testified on Wednesday in a workplace discrimination trial brought by the actor's former personal assistant Graham Chase Robinson in New York federal civil court.

Ms Robinson is suing the Flowers of the Killer Moon actor for $12m (£9.9m) for allegedly causing her ""extreme emotional distress and reputational harm"" during 11 years working at his vanity company Canal Productions.

De Niro, 80, claims in a countersuit that his former assistant stole five million air miles from his company, racked up $35,000 in unauthorised Uber trips, and paid for expensive restaurant dinners and fancy groceries on her company credit card.

On Wednesday, Mr Harvey took the stand to give his experience of working as a long-term employee of De Niro, and said he had never witnessed De Niro's anger directed at Ms Robinson.

But perhaps more interestingly for movie buffs, Mr Harvey shared fascinating anecdotes about some of the Oscar-winning star's biggest roles.

He told the court how he began working with the screen legend in early 1984. De Niro was struggling to lose the 35 pounds (16kgs) he had put on for his role as boxer Jake LaMotta in Raging Bull, and sought out the former ex-University of Maryland wrestler's services.

He became a full time personal trainer for De Niro in 1985, and would work out with the actor nearly every day and travel with him to film locations all over the world.

""I like working for him because he's a very disciplined man who works hard at his craft and I respect him very much,"" Mr Harvey told the court.

Mr Harvey became De Niro's trusted confidante and dialogue sparring partner. The pair would work out for hours more than 300 days a year at De Niro's properties in New York City, Montauk, and upstate New York. Afterwards, the pair would recite lines on upcoming movie projects for several more hours.

""He might want to look gaunt or sometimes overweight, sometimes muscular. We worked accordingly,"" he said.

The first of their 93 films working together was the 1984 romantic drama Falling in Love, starring De Niro and Meryl Streep.

Asked to recall memorable films he had worked with De Niro on, Mr Harvey first cited 1991's Cape Fear.

At the age of 48, De Niro reportedly went on a high-carbohydrate diet of brown rice and green vegetables to fuel marathon workout sessions of chin ups, push ups and up to 600 crunches a day.

""It was impactful because he was playing a character who had recently got out of prison after many years, and he had to be defined and cut and muscular,"" Mr Harvey said.

For Goodfellas, De Niro's mob hitman character Jimmy Conway had to age by several decades midway through the shoot, and so Mr Harvey devised a rigorous three-week training programme to make him look ""old and gaunt"".

Mr Harvey said his role broadened from workouts to dialogue training, and he would accompany De Niro to table reads of prospective scripts and during hours of role-playing scenes.

Mr Harvey said he was told he had ""good rhythm"" for the dialogue.

In the 2008 drama Just What Happened, Mr Harvey told how he recited lines on the other end of a phone while De Niro's character was supposedly talking to his ex-wife played by Robin Wright.

De Niro was a ""generous"" boss, he said.

He started out on a salary of $55,000, which eventually rose to $375,000 a year by 2019, and would receive a week's salary bonus on his birthday and at Christmas.

He was forced to spend long periods away from his family in California while working with De Niro at his homes in New York, or filming on location everywhere from Colombia to Australia.

Working days typically started at 3.30am, with the pair rehearsing De Niro's lines for several hours before filming began.

""There was not a moment to waste,"" he said.

During testimony last week, Ms Robinson, who earned $300,000 a year, said she approached De Niro seeking the same salary as Mr Harvey.

The actor supposedly responded: ""Chase you don't have kids. Dan has a family to support.""

Ms Robinson also alleged she was forced to carry out ""demeaning"" tasks such as washing De Niro's bed sheets and gift shopping for his seven children, which she felt was stereotypically women's work and evidence of gender discrimination.

Earlier on Wednesday, Ms Robinson's attorneys rested their case and the defence called forensic psychiatrist Kimberly Resnick to the witness stand.

Dr Resnick, who testified she earned around $90,000 for her work on the case, interviewed Ms Robinson for seven hours and reviewed her work and psychiatric records.

She refuted earlier testimony from Dr Robert Goldstein, who diagnosed Ms Robinson with ""generalised anxiety disorder"" that arose from her time working for De Niro.

Dr Resnick said that the former assistant instead showed ""traits of narcissism, paranoia and grandiosity"".

""While Ms Robinson was reporting symptoms of stress, they were in the realm of normal human reactions and responses to stressful events,"" she said.

After Mr Harvey's testimony, the defence rested its case and closing arguments were expected to begin on Wednesday afternoon.","{'uri': 'independent.co.uk', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'The Independent'}",[],https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/02/07/16/robert-de-niro.jpg?quality=75&width=1200&auto=webp,eng-9037551,-0.1843137254901961,54,54,The Independent,independent.co.uk

The judge at the centre of Trump fraud trial,"Donald Trump and his legal team have been at loggerheads with the judge of his fraud trial, Arthur Engoron, calling him 'unhinged' for slamming the table during the former president's testimony.

Engoron was frustrated by Trump's responses to his questioning, asking for him to be controlled by his entourage as 'this is not a political rally, this is a courtroom'.

Since 2020, when he began heading up cases linked to Trump, Engoron has forced Trump to sit for a deposition, held him in contempt of court and fined him more than $100,000.

His most recent ruling found that Trump had inflated his net worth - committing multiple years of fraud by exaggerating his wealth on financial statements used to get loans and secure deals.

So, who is Arthur Engoron? Find out by reading on.

Arthur Engoron has been labelled as one of the judge's who 'haunts' New York real estate

In 2020, Engoron was put in charge of cases against Donald Trump, in his Supreme Court role

Who is Arthur Engoron?

Manhattan Supreme Court Justice Arthur Engoron was named by property website The Real Deal as one of the judge's who 'haunts' New York real estate.

He was appointed to the Supreme Court in 2015 having previously served as a civil court judge.

Engoron, born in 1949, is a few years younger than Trump, and grew up in Queens, New York - just a matter of miles from his new defendant's childhood home.

The Engoron family later moved to East Williston on Long Island, where he studied at The Wheatley School, a public high school in Old Westbury.

There, he ran and wrote for the student newspaper before graduating in 1967.

He has since founded and directed the school's alumni association and writes an online newsletter about fellow graduates who have nicknamed him the 'Mayor of Wheatley.'

While at Columbia University in the 1960s, Engoron worked as a taxi driver, but he got his law degree from New York University in 1979.

He has worked as a litigator and was a law clerk for 11 years for a judge in the same court where he sits today.

Away from the bar, he has been married three times, and has had four children.

What is Donald Trump on trial for?

Trump and Engoron have met as a result of fraud action brought by New York attorney general Letitia James.

James is seeking $250 million in damages after the ruling that he had inflated his wealth in financial statements, in a non-jury trial in Manhattan to resolve the remaining claims.

The trial has also implicated Trump's companies and top executives.

What has Arthur Engoron decided so far?

In September, Engoron ruled that Trump had committed years of fraud by exaggerating his wealth and the value of his assets in financial statements he used to get loans and make deals.

The judge announced he would dissolve some of Trump's companies as punishment, which could cause the former president to lose control of New York properties such as Trump Tower.

Despite this being a civil trial, Trump - who is listed as a witness - has called the potential punishment 'the corporate death penalty'.

Engoron in 2015, the year he was appointed to the Supreme Court

What other cases has judge Arthur Engoron been involved in?

During his time on the bench, Engoron has battled other New York billionaires such as former mayor Michael Bloomberg and New York Knicks owner James Dolan, contributing to his reputation for 'haunting' New York real estate.

In January 2023, he halted a proposed new apartment tower in Manhattan's South Street Seaport district that was reported to have been an $850 million project.

In the article accusing Engoron of 'haunting' real estate, he's quoted as saying: 'These are huge towers. I've lived in the city my whole life. You can't just do this because the zoning allows it. I just can't believe this is the case.'

The piece mentions that Engoron was responsible for nixing four new towers even though they complied with zoning laws.

Also this year, Engoron attracted the ire of James Dolan when he threw out the Long Island billionaire's lawsuit against the State Liquor Authority.

Dolan was suing after the body threatened to remove the liquor licenses from Madison Square Garden over its use of facial recognition software.

Back in 2012, Engoron ruled against then-Mayor Michael Bloomberg's plan to introduce more taxis to New York City's 'outer-boroughs.'

Engoron's reasons were that Bloomberg sought approval from state officials before bringing the issue to New York City's Council.

How has Donald Trump responded?

Trump has taken to his social media platform Truth Social to call New York attorney general Letitia James 'racist'

The former president slammed the 'political warfare' against him that only takes place 'in banana republics' ahead of being sworn in for the trial

Trump addressed the press before walking inside on his first appearance, saying: 'These are all political opponent attacks ads by the Biden administration, their poll numbers are terrible'

Trump has been scathing of his accusers, calling Engoron 'biased' and saying that James is 'racist, evil and corrupt'.

He has also taken to his social media platform Truth Social to suggest that the trial is a way of President Joe Biden interfering in the upcoming presidential election.

In the wake of the initial fraud ruling, Trump overtook Biden in polls predicting the 2024 outcome.

Trump addressed the press before walking inside on his first appearance.

'So while Israel is being attacked, while Ukraine is being attacked, while inflation is eating our country alive, I'm down here,' he said.

'These are all political opponent attacks ads by the Biden administration, their poll numbers are terrible.

'The New York Times came back with a poll that I'm leading all over the place, but it's a very unfair situation.'

The former president slammed the 'political warfare' against him that only takes place 'in banana republics' ahead of being sworn in for the trial.

The 77-year-old also insisted Mar-a-Lago is worth '50 to 100 times' the $18 million value prosecutors have determined, and claimed he is being targeted by people who 'hate this country'.","{'uri': 'dailymail.co.uk', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'Daily Mail Online'}",[],https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2023/11/07/12/77500289-0-image-m-37_1699359402175.jpg,eng-9036695,0.003921568627450966,54,54,Daily Mail Online,dailymail.co.uk

CNN --

Try to keep track of the galaxy of former President Donald Trump's legal problems.

A judge in New York will hear Trump explain on Monday, under oath and in a witness box, why his company inflated the value of his assets when he was trying to secure loans.

A judge in Colorado heard testimony this past week from January 6, 2021, rally organizers as she considers whether Trump engaged in an insurrection against the US and thus should be disqualified from the presidential ballot in 2024.

A federal appeals court in Washington, DC, temporarily froze a limited gag order placed on the former president by the judge overseeing his forthcoming federal election subversion trial.

A federal judge in Florida signaled she may postpone the federal criminal trial against Trump that she's overseeing - the one regarding his treatment of classified material that was, among other places, kept in a bathroom at his Mar-a-Lago resort - because how could his lawyers keep up with all of this?

Trump denies any wrongdoing in all legal matters and has pleaded not guilty in all of the criminal cases - which relate not just to his efforts to remain president by overturning the 2020 election and his treatment of classified material after his presidency but also to a hush-money scheme that may have helped him win the White House in 2016.

He alleges a ""witch hunt"" against him and says the varied legal actions are examples of election interference to keep him from the White House. But each trial has its own distinct storyline to follow.

Here's an updated list of developments in Trump's very complicated set of court cases, beginning with a quick historical note about former presidents as witnesses in their own defense.

Has a former president ever given testimony in his own civil trial?

When Trump takes the stand in his New York civil fraud trial Monday, it won't be the first time a former president will have given testimony in his own defense in a lawsuit.

Teddy Roosevelt did it twice more than a hundred years ago, both when he sued a Michigan newspaper that accused him of being a drunk and later when he was sued by a fellow New York Republican whom Roosevelt had called a corrupt political boss.

Roosevelt won both cases. Trump, by contrast, has already been found liable for fraud by the judge in New York.

Those Roosevelt trials, separated by two years, were each sensational at the time, and they came after Roosevelt's final campaign for the White House, when he placed second to Democrat Woodrow Wilson in 1912 after splitting with Republicans and running as a Progressive.

Library of Congress

Trump, on the other hand, is very much still in the arena, and his legal strategy in a slew of civil and criminal cases is tied to his concurrent presidential campaign. He has argued that two gag orders - the one issued against him by a federal judge in Washington, DC, and the other by the civil trial judge in New York - hinder his ability to speak as a candidate.

New York state civil court: $250 million fraud case

The civil fraud trial, unlike Trump's criminal indictments, does not carry the danger of a felony conviction and jail time, but it could very well cost him some of his most prized possessions, including Trump Tower.

New York Attorney General Letitia James brought the $250 million lawsuit in September 2022, alleging that Trump and his co-defendants committed repeated fraud in inflating assets on financial statements to get better terms on commercial real estate loans and insurance policies.

Judge Arthur Engoron has already ruled that Trump and his adult sons are liable for fraud for inflating the value of his golf courses, hotels and homes on financial statements to secure loans.

Trump's adult sons, Donald Jr. and Eric, gave at-times tense testimony in which they deflected blame to accountants for inflating the company's assets. A higher court in New York rejected Ivanka Trump's attempt to delay Engoron's order for her forthcoming testimony because she didn't want to leave Florida to travel to New York while her children are in school.

The trial portion of the case is meant to assess what damages will be levied against Trump and how Engoron's decision to strip Trump of his New York business licenses will play out. In addition to the high-profile testimony by Trump family members, the judge has also issued a gag order on the former president and on Friday expanded it to his attorneys, after Trump criticized a clerk of the court.

Insurrection clause cases

The government watchdog group Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington brought a case on behalf of six Colorado voters in an attempt to disqualify Trump from Colorado's primary and general election ballots. They argue he is disqualified by the 14th Amendment of the Constitution's ""insurrectionist ban"" by instigating the January 6, 2021, attack.

A judge in Colorado heard detailed testimony from legal scholars, January 6 rally organizers, Capitol Police officers and House lawmakers over the past week. Closing arguments are not expected until later in November.

Meanwhile, judges on Minnesota's Supreme Court appeared skeptical of similar arguments in a separate case that held a hearing this past week.

Federal civil court in New York: E. Jean Carroll defamation lawsuit

In May, a federal jury in Manhattan found Trump sexually abused former advice columnist E. Jean Carroll in a luxury department store dressing room in the mid-1990s and awarded her about $5 million.

A separate civil defamation lawsuit will need to decide only how much money Trump has to pay her. That case is set for January 15 - the same day Iowa Republicans will hold their caucuses, the first date on the presidential primary calendar.

Trump has argued that as a former president he should have some immunity from the case.

Federal criminal court in DC: 2020 election interference

In August, Trump was indicted by a federal grand jury in special counsel Jack Smith's investigation into the aftermath of the 2020 election. The former president was arraigned in a Washington, DC, courtroom, where he pleaded not guilty.

The case is based in part on a scheme to create slates of fake electors in key states won by President Joe Biden.

In late September, Judge Tanya Chutkan rejected Trump's request that she recuse herself from the case. Chutkan, a Barack Obama appointee, has overseen civil and criminal cases related to the January 6, 2021, insurrection and has repeatedly exceeded what prosecutors have requested for convicted rioters' prison sentences.

Chutkan set the trial's start date for March 4, the day before Super Tuesday, when the largest batch of presidential primaries will occur. The trial marks the first of Trump's criminal cases expected to proceed.

Trump asked a federal appeals court to pause Chutkan's gag order prohibiting him from talking about the case and has indicated he will take the issue all the way to the Supreme Court. The appeals court on Friday temporarily froze the gag order while it considers the request.

There are multiple other issues to hash out before March. For instance, Trump wants the case dismissed because he argues his actions in late 2020 and early 2021 fall under his presidential duties and make him immune to prosecution. Chutkan has not yet acknowledged the request.

New York criminal court: Hush-money payments

Trump has been charged in Manhattan criminal court with 34 felony counts of falsifying business records related to his role in a hush-money payment scheme involving adult-film actress Stormy Daniels late in the 2016 presidential campaign.

The former president pleaded not guilty at his April arraignment in Manhattan.

Prosecutors, led by Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg, accuse Trump of falsifying business records with the intent to conceal $130,000 in payments to Daniels made by former Trump attorney and fixer Michael Cohen to guarantee her silence about an alleged affair.

Trump has denied having an affair with Daniels.

The trial was originally scheduled to begin in late March 2024, but Judge Juan Merchan has suggested the date could move. The next court date is scheduled for February.

Georgia criminal court: Efforts to overturn election results

Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis is using racketeering violations to charge a broad criminal conspiracy against Trump and 18 others in their efforts to overturn Biden's victory in Georgia.

The probe was launched in 2021 following Trump's call that January with Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, in which the president pushed the Republican official to ""find"" votes to overturn the election results.

The August indictment also includes how Trump's team allegedly misled state officials in Georgia, organized fake electors, harassed an election worker, and breached election equipment in rural Coffee County, Georgia.

Four of Trump's 18 co-defendants have now pleaded guilty, avoiding jail time and agreeing to testify at later points in the trial.

The pleas by three former Trump attorneys, Sidney Powell, Jenna Ellis and Kenneth Chesebro, could be particularly important and turn these former allies into nemeses.

Ellis admitted wrongdoing in a tearful October court hearing, acknowledging her role in peddling election lies. Powell was at key White House meetings before the January 6, 2021, insurrection. Chesebro helped assemble slates of fake electors that Trump's campaign orchestrated as it tried to undo election results.

Federal criminal court in Florida: Mishandling classified material

Trump has pleaded not guilty to 37 federal charges brought by Smith over his alleged mishandling of classified documents. Smith added three additional counts in a superseding indictment.

The investigation centers on sensitive documents that Trump brought to his Mar-a-Lago residence in Florida after his White House term ended in January 2021.

A photo released by the Department of Justice shows boxes of documents stored in a bathroom at Trump's Mar-a-Lago club in Florida in early 2021. U.S. Justice Department/Handout/Reuters

The National Archives, charged with collecting and sorting presidential material, has previously said that at least 15 boxes of White House records were recovered from Mar-a-Lago, including some classified records.

Trump was also caught on tape in a 2021 meeting in Bedminster, New Jersey, where the former president discussed holding secret documents he did not declassify.

Smith's additional charges allege that Trump and his employees attempted to delete Mar-a-Lago security footage sought by the grand jury investigating the mishandling of the records.

The trial is not expected until May, after most presidential primaries have concluded, although the judge in the case has suggested she could delay things.

There are other cases to note:

Trump Organization: Convicted of criminal tax fraud

Trump's namesake business, the Trump Organization, was convicted in December by a New York jury of tax fraud, grand larceny and falsifying business records in what prosecutors say was a 15-year scheme to defraud tax authorities by failing to report and pay taxes on compensation provided to employees.

Former Trump Organization Chief Financial Officer Allen Weisselberg pleaded guilty to his role in the tax scheme. He was released after serving four months in jail at Rikers Island.

Weisselberg testified at the New York civil fraud trial in October, but didn't recall much about the creation of the financial statements at the core of that trial.

January 6: Lawsuits by police officers

Several members of the US Capitol Police and Washington, DC, Metropolitan Police are suing Trump, saying his words and actions incited the 2021 riot.

The various cases accuse Trump of directing assault and battery; aiding and abetting assault and battery; and violating Washington laws that prohibit the incitement of riots and disorderly conduct.

Some of the lawsuits have been put on hold while a federal appeals court considers whether Trump had absolute immunity as the sitting president.

Personal retaliation: Peter Strzok lawsuit

Former top FBI counterintelligence official Peter Strzok, who was fired in 2018 after the revelation that he criticized Trump in text messages, sued the Justice Department, alleging he was terminated improperly.

Trump sat for a deposition under oath in the lawsuit in October.

Trump victory in Michael Cohen's retaliation suit

Trump's former lawyer Cohen sued Trump, former Attorney General William Barr and others, alleging they put him back in jail to prevent him from promoting his upcoming book while under home confinement.

A federal judge threw out the lawsuit in November 2022. District Judge Lewis Liman said he was empathetic to Cohen's position but that Supreme Court precedent bars him from allowing the case to move forward.

Cohen, however, recently testified against Trump in the New York civil fraud lawsuit.

Trump-filed lawsuits: The New York Times, Mary Trump and CNN

The former president is suing his niece and The New York Times in New York state court over the disclosure of his tax information.

A New York judge dismissed The New York Times from Trump's lawsuit regarding disclosure of his tax returns and ordered Trump to pay the newspaper's legal fees. Trump is still suing his niece Mary Trump for disclosure of the tax documents. She had tried to sue him for defrauding her out of millions after the death of his father, but the suit was dismissed.","{'uri': 'cnn.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'CNN'}",[],"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/2023-10-24t153853z-361721341-rc22z3ajy88s-rtrmadp-3-usa-trump-new-york.JPG?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill",eng-9031235,-0.07450980392156858,54,54,CNN,cnn.com

We're Maggie Haberman and Alan Feuer, your hosts for this first edition of our guide to Donald Trump's proliferating legal troubles and their intersection with his efforts to return to the White House.

Maggie literally wrote the book on Trump -- ""Confidence Man"" -- and has followed the former president since his days as a New York City real estate developer. Alan has been covering the courts for more than 20 years, and has been closely tracking the hundreds of cases stemming from the attack on the Capitol by a pro-Trump mob.

More recently, we have worked together reporting on the complex and often confusing array of criminal and civil proceedings that Trump is facing: seven major cases in six courthouses in four cities. The constellation of legal problems is unfolding at an extraordinary moment not only for him, but for the country: just as he solidifies his position as the Republican Party's leading 2024 presidential candidate in a campaign marked by his continued baseless claims that he was robbed of victory in 2020.

In the coming months, we will help you track both the big picture and the telling details of the legal cases. We will also grapple with what the cases tell us about a climate in which a former president facing an array of criminal charges remains a powerful political force. And we look forward to hearing from you and answering your questions along the way.

Loyalty test, part one

This week put a spotlight on two important elements of the Trump story -- and in some ways they were in tension with one another.

The first was the erosion of loyalty to the former president from people who once proudly fought alongside him.

Jenna Ellis is a lawyer who helped spread the lie that Trump had been denied re-election by massive voting fraud, and assisted in the effort to overturn Joe Biden's victory. On Tuesday, she turned state's evidence against him in the case in Georgia, in which Trump and others stand accused of a vast racketeering conspiracy to keep him in power.

Ellis was the third Trump-affiliated lawyer to flip in the span of a week, joining Sidney Powell and Kenneth Chesebro, in pleading guilty and agreeing to testify for the prosecution. Our colleague Glenn Thrush broke down what the guilty pleas in Georgia might mean for the federal election prosecution against Trump.

The shifting loyalty dynamic was also on dramatic display in the civil trial in New York, where his company is facing a reckoning for inflating the value of his properties.

With Trump scowling from the sidelines, Michael Cohen, his onetime lawyer and fixer, described how he had worked for years to carry out his former boss's wishes, fixing the value of Trump's assets to predetermined figures. Trump and his team portrayed Cohen as a serial liar, saying he acknowledged on the stand that he hadn't been truthful before a federal judge in his own guilty plea to an array of crimes. And he appeared flustered during some of the cross-examination.

Loyalty test, part two

If those developments suggested trouble for Trump, the week also brought fresh evidence of how the enduring support of his most loyal voters continues to shape national politics.

On Capitol Hill, House Republicans, continuing a shift to the right, finally elected a new speaker, one who came with the Trump seal of approval. Representative Mike Johnson of Louisiana was at the forefront of the election denier movement. He played a leading role in the effort to overturn the 2020 election.

Johnson was the driving force behind a brief signed by congressional Republicans in support of a Texas lawsuit, rooted in baseless claims of widespread election irregularities, that tried to throw out the results in four battleground states won by Biden. And on Jan. 6, 2021, after a pro-Trump mob had overrun the Capitol, Johnson voted against certifying the Electoral College outcome. After his victory, supporters called him ""MAGA Mike.""

The gag orders

The line between Trump's legal strategy and his campaign is all but nonexistent, and his eagerness to vent has often caused him problems in courtrooms, even if his attacks on prosecutors, judges and others involved in the cases earn him valuable currency with his supporters.

The judge in the New York civil trial accused Trump of violating a gag order and unexpectedly put him on the witness stand, interrogating him about whether he had purposefully gone after a member of the court's staff. Even though Trump denied it, claiming his remarks had been directed at Cohen, the judge still fined Trump $10,000.

Trump may have also talked himself into trouble in the federal case, in which he stands accused of conspiring to remain in power. He is facing a gag order in that proceeding too, though it has been frozen temporarily.

Citing public statements from the former president just in recent days, prosecutors asked Judge Tanya S. Chutkan, who imposed the gag order, to reinstate it as soon as possible. More ominously for the former president, the prosecutors also asked the judge to reconsider the lenient conditions under which Trump was released from custody after his indictment.

Trump has a long history of testing the boundaries, and he showed no signs of reining himself in this week.

Where do the four criminal cases stand?

Trump is at the center of at least four separate criminal investigations, at both the state and federal levels, into matters related to his business and political careers. Here is where each case currently stands.

What to watch next week

Expect a showdown in court on Wednesday over the timing of Trump's federal classified documents trial in Florida. His lawyers have been trying to have the trial put off until after the 2024 election. They will square off in front of a judge with prosecutors who want to get the case in front of a jury quickly.

Then on Friday, the Justice Department is expected to file court papers opposing a request by the news media to televise Trump's federal election interference trial in Washington.

More Trump coverage

Near the center of the New York fraud trial and the Georgia case are lawyers, like Michael Cohen, who pledged public fealty to Trump -- until they very publicly did not.

If Trump continues to violate his gag order, which bars him from attacking the judge's staff, the punishments could intensify.

Jenna Ellis, the lawyer who agreed to cooperate in the Georgia prosecution, had direct ties to Trump and to Rudy Giuliani.

Anthony Pratt, one of Australia's wealthiest men, made his way into Trump's inner circle. He is now a potential witness who could testify against Trump.

When Staff Sgt. Buck Aldridge fatally shot Leonard Cure during a roadside struggle after pulling him over for speeding, it wasn't the first time a traffic stop involving the Camden County sheriff's deputy had spiraled into violence.

Last year, Aldridge dragged a driver from a car that crashed after fleeing the deputy on Interstate 95. Body and dash camera video obtained by The Associated Press show the driver on his back as Aldridge punches him. Records indicate the deputy faced no disciplinary action.

Personnel records show Aldridge was fired in August 2017 by a police department in the same Georgia county after he threw a woman to the ground and handcuffed her during a traffic stop. The Camden County Sheriff's Office hired him nine months later.

Aldridge stopped Cure for speeding Oct. 16 and ended up shocking the 53-year-old Black man with a Taser after he refused to put his hands behind him to be cuffed. Body and dash camera videos show Cure fought back and had a hand at the deputy's throat when Aldridge shot him point-blank.

Relatives have said Cure likely resisted because of psychological trauma from spending 16 years imprisoned in Florida for an armed robbery he didn't commit. Officials exonerated and freed him in 2020.

The Georgia Bureau of Investigation is investigating Cure's death and will submit its findings to prosecutors. Aldridge's attorney said the video shows he fired in self-defense. Critics question whether he should have been wearing a badge at all, given his history of aggression.

""This guy should have never been on the force,"" said Timothy Bessent Sr., president of Camden County's NAACP chapter.

The AP obtained Aldridge's personnel records as well as reports and videos from the June 2022 chase and arrest using Georgia's open records law.

A former U.S. Marine, Aldridge, 41, worked nearly five years for the Kingsland Police Department in Georgia's southeast corner. His file shows Aldridge was disciplined for using unnecessary force in February 2014 and May 2017. The second time he was suspended for three days without pay.

The department fired Aldridge for his third infraction just three months later. Police records say Aldridge was assisting with a traffic stop when he tried to handcuff a woman -- not to arrest her, but to keep her outside her car. One deputy told investigators Aldridge cuffed the woman after ""picking her up and throwing her on the ground."" She was cited for letting an unlicensed person drive her car.

Aldridge was hired by the sheriff's office in May 2018. He disclosed his firing on his job application.

Aldridge's termination wouldn't automatically disqualify him from working for another agency, though some would consider it a huge liability, said retired police Maj. Neill Franklin.

""If someone's terminated from another police department for use of excessive force, they're not getting hired by the Maryland State Police or the Baltimore Police Department,"" said Franklin, who led training programs for both agencies. ""It's just not worth the risk.""

Bessent and other advocates say it's an example of Camden County Sheriff Jim Proctor tolerating unnecessary violence.

Proctor, who has been sheriff for a decade, declined to comment. Spokesman Capt. Larry Bruce cited the investigation into Cure's death and pending civil litigation involving other deputies.

Since last year, six Camden County deputies have been indicted on felony charges and fired for violence against jail detainees and a motorist.

In September 2022, jail security cameras recorded guards rushing into the cell of Jarrett Hobbs, who was punched in the head and neck and hurled against a wall. Hobbs was charged with assaulting jailers until his attorney obtained the video. His charges were dropped, and three deputies were indicted.

Two more jailers were charged and fired for incidents in March and July. Security video showed one push a detainee to the floor and punch him before another guard intervened. The other deputy shoved a handcuffed detainee headfirst into a door, knocking him unconscious.

""You've got these deputies running wild and doing what they want to do,"" said Harry Daniels, a civil rights attorney who won a legal settlement for Hobbs. ""The consequences have come from the GBI and the district attorney's office. It should not come from an outside agency.""

He points to Christine Newman, named ""Deputy of the Month"" two months after a dash camera recorded her slapping a handcuffed driver across the face and slamming the woman's head into a patrol SUV. The driver had refused to exit her vehicle after being pulled over for a rolling stop Jan. 16, 2022.

Newman was fired a year later after being indicted on charges including aggravated assault and violating her oath of office. She has pleaded not guilty. Newman's attorney, Robert Persse, called her a ""loyal deputy"" whom he looks forward to defending in court.

The number of deputies facing charges ""indicates a culture that may not encourage use of force, but certainly tolerates inappropriate use of force,"" said retired LaGrange, Georgia, Police Chief Louis Dekmar.

""If folks are held accountable and there are clear lines, you generally don't see that in law enforcement agencies,"" said Dekmar, a former president of the International Association of Chiefs of Police.

A spike in claims involving the sheriff's office caused Camden County's government to get dropped by its insurance company in July, said Mike Spiers, the county's risk management director. The county got new policies, he said, but its deductible for liability jumped from $25,000 per claim to $250,000.

Aldridge was placed on administrative leave while the GBI investigates Cure's death.

""Buck Aldridge is a fine officer and the video speaks for itself,"" said Adrienne Browning, Aldridge's attorney. ""It's clear his life was in danger and he defended himself.""

Video of the fatal confrontation along I-95 shows Aldridge telling Cure he's being charged with reckless driving for speeding in excess of 100 mph (161 kph). Cure argues, but obeys commands to get out and put his hands on his truck. However, he ignores commands to put his hands behind him.

That's when Aldridge fires his Taser into Cure's back. Cure fights back, and video shows them grappling beside the highway. Cure maintains a grip on Aldridge's face and neck after being struck with a baton.

""Yeah, bitch!"" Cure says. Then he slumps to the ground after Aldridge fires a single shot.

Dekmar, Franklin and a third expert told AP they believe the shooting was legal, as Aldridge appeared to be in danger when he fired. But they also criticized how Aldridge began the encounter by shouting at Cure and said he made no effort to deescalate.

""He escalated the situation with Mr. Cure,"" said former Memphis police officer Thaddeus Johnson, a criminal justice professor at Georgia State University and a senior fellow for the Council on Criminal Justice. ""He has no control over his emotions.""

Johnson said Aldridge showed a similar lack of control during a June 2022 arrest after chasing two speeding cars.

The driver resists being cuffed but complies after another deputy's dog bites him and Aldridge shocks him with a Taser. The driver was charged with drug trafficking, reckless driving and fleeing an officer.

Aldridge was promoted to staff sergeant two months later. His sheriff's personnel file shows no disciplinary actions.

Johnson said he sees no justification for Aldridge punching the arrested driver. Even if prosecutors don't charge him in Cure's death, he said, ""from what I saw in the video, he deserves to be fired.""

The motion for a mistrial makes good on a promise Trump's attorneys made to file it the day he testified in the case on Nov. 6. The announcement capped off an intense day of examination in which Trump -- who has frequently criticized New York Judge Arthur Engoron and his clerk -- even lashed out at the judge on the witness stand, pointing at him and calling him a ""fraud.""

In the filing, Trump's attorneys claim that ""the Court has abrogated its constitutional responsibility to ensure each Defendant, including President Trump, receives a fair trial free from even the appearance of impropriety and impartiality.""

The trial began Oct. 2 and is expected to last through mid-December. Trump, two of his sons and their company are accused of perpetrating a decade of fraud and benefiting by at least $250 million, by submitting inflated valuations of his properties and net worth to banks and insurers.

Trump and his attorneys have repeatedly accused the judge of favoring New York Attorney General Letitia James, a Democrat. Engoron is also a Democrat. He was appointed by then-Gov. Andrew Cuomo to the New York Supreme Court, 1st Judicial District, in 2013, after previously serving as a judge on New York City's civil court. He ran unopposed for the position in 2015, and is serving a 14-year term.

""Indeed, left unchecked, the introduction of such demonstrable pro-Attorney General and antiTrump/big real estate bias into a case of worldwide interest involving the front-runner for the Presidency of the United States impugns the integrity of the entire system,"" wrote the attorneys for Trump, who is leading polls ahead of the 2024 Republican presidential primaries.

The mistrial motion also accuses Engoron's law clerk, Allison Greenfield, of bias and ""co-judging"" the case. Greenfield, who is also a Democrat, typically sits next to the judge. During pretrial hearings, she often questioned attorneys for the two sides herself. She and lawyers for Trump have had many heated exchanges over the course of the case.

Trump and his campaign have twice violated a limited gag order put in place Oct. 3, after Trump made a derogatory social media post about Greenfield. He's paid $15,000 in fines related to the gag order violations.

Engoron has said he relies on her for legal research, but the Trump team has complained of being distracted by Greenfield passing ""notes"" to the judge. On Nov. 2, defense attorney Christopher Kise said in court that he had recently watched proceedings on a closed circuit television feed, observing behavior he said added to his ""perception of bias"" when a member of his team, Jesus Suarez, was questioning a witness.

""Every time Mr. Suarez was making a point and there was a dialog, there would be notes passed to you,"" Kise said. ""When the Attorney General was speaking, there would be no notes passed to you.""

Kise's accusation provoked Engoron's ire that day. He pounded the bench with his fist, narrating the action as he did it.

""That's -- I'm going to pound the table -- - confidential communications from my principal law clerk. I have an absolute right to it and you don't have any right to see it or question it,"" Engoron said.

Engoron later barred the attorneys from referring to the notes.

The motion cites the clerk's name eight times, including references to her social media accounts, and they refer to the ""Principal Law Clerk"" 44 times. Two photos of the judge and his clerk together on the bench taken during this trial were also included in the filing.

""Once again, Donald Trump is trying to dismiss the truth and the facts, but the numbers and evidence don't lie,"" a spokesperson for the Attorney General's office said in a statement. ""He can keep trying to distract from his fraud, but the truth always comes out.""

The mistrial motion comes amid the defense's first week calling its own witnesses in the case, including Donald Trump Jr., who has twice testified. Their defense presentation began after more than five weeks of testimony in the state's case.

Judge Engoron has previously indicated he would deny the request for mistrial, initially urging counsel not to file the request.

Meanwhile, the seventh week of the civil trial is continuing in Manhattan.

On Wednesday morning, the judge only acknowledged the mistrial request briefly, asking the government if it planned to respond. That decision, New York prosecutors said, would come by Thursday. If they respond, they will do so with a proposed schedule order that would suggest how long the judge might take to rule on this.

In court Wednesday, the Trump legal team continued with its direct line of questioning of expert witness Jason Flemmons. The forensic accountant and former deputy chief accountant at the SEC was asked a series of questions related to Trump's financial statements and its supporting data used by the outside accounting firm Mazars, and whether its methods were consistent with accounting standards.

Flemmons testified there were ""quite a few"" disclosures made in Trump's financial statements related to departures from generally accepted accounting principles. The testimony bolstered the Trumps' defense that they were transparent in compiling the documents, didn't hide departures from accounting standards, and properly advised banks and insurers to perform their own due diligence.","{'uri': 'cbsnews.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'CBS News'}",[],https://assets3.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2023/11/15/7419a2fb-1c74-469c-8928-5e1b9b1a1632/thumbnail/1200x630g2/3ad0ff76aceae17168eae44fef0a5245/gettyimages-1788713242.jpg?v=0468e1acbdfcea10e0b300333bc497c4,eng-9055588,0.03529411764705892,51,51,CBS News,cbsnews.com

Justices at the UK's highest court unanimously upheld an earlier High Court judgment on legislation announced 18 months ago to send asylum seekers who arrive in the UK by unauthorised means to Kigali to have their claims heard there.

The defeat will further frustrate what Downing Street admits is a 'crucial' part of his plans to halt Channel crossings and inflame the row with Mrs Braverman, who was sacked Home Secretary on Monday.

It will also revive demands by Tory right-wingers to leave the European Convention on Human Rights.

Ministers had vowed to press on with the scheme regardless of the result today, with options including elevating the Rwanda deal to a treaty ratified in parliament - making it harder for the courts to block - and passing emergency legislation to disapply human rights laws.

In an excoriating letter to the Prime Minister yesterday, Mrs Braverman warned he has no 'credible Plan B' if an earlier High Court ruling that the policy is unlawful is upheld.

As of November 12, 27,284 people had crossed the Channel.

Meanwhile, the 'legacy' backlog of UK asylum applications stood at 33,253 as of October 29, down nearly a half (47%) from 62,157 on July 30, according to new figures from the Home Office.

Mrs Braverman's replacement, James Cleverly, outlined the possible outcomes during the first meeting of the Prime Minister's new-look Cabinet after the dramatic reshuffle that saw Mrs Braverman shown the door.

Senior ministers had wargamed responses to a defeat, but Mrs Braverman warned of a 'betrayal' of Mr Sunak's promise to do 'whatever it takes' to stop the crossings regardless.

The sacked Home Secretary wrote in the letter that if they lose he will have 'wasted a year' on the Illegal Migration Act 'only to arrive back at square one'.

'Worse than this, your magical thinking - believing that you can will your way through this without upsetting polite opinion - has meant you have failed to prepare any sort of credible 'Plan B',' she said.

Downing Street has vowed to continue to work to tackle small boat crossings 'whatever the outcome' in the Supreme Court.

'The Prime Minister believes in actions, not words,' a No 10 spokeswoman said in response to Mrs Braverman's declaration of political war.

Leaving the European Convention on Human Rights was not discussed at yesterday's Cabinet meeting, the Prime Minister's official spokesman said.

Contingency plans have been 'discussed among Cabinet ministers', the spokesman said, and 'options for possible scenarios' have been prepared.

Last month, the Home Office challenged a Court of Appeal ruling from June that overturned the High Court's finding that Rwanda could be considered a 'safe third country' for migrants.

Lawyers representing people facing deportation to the east African nation argued Rwanda is an 'authoritarian, one-party state' with a 'woefully deficient' asylum system.

But the Home Office has said the policy to remove asylum seekers to a 'country less attractive' than the UK, 'but nevertheless safe', is lawful.

The strategy is aimed at deterring migrants from crossing the English Channel on small boats

Mr Sunak faces Prime Minister's Questions directly after today's ruling.

The Illegal Migration Act brought into law the Government's policy of sending some asylum seekers to Rwanda.

However, the plans announced in April 2022 have been held up in the courts, with no deportation flights having taken place despite £140 million already being handed to Kigali.

Whereas Mrs Braverman repeatedly signalled she wanted out of the 'politicised court', Mr Cleverly said while foreign secretary in April he was 'not convinced' the move is necessary.

He said that the European countries that are not signatories - Russia and Belarus - are a 'small club', adding: 'I am not convinced it is a club we want to be part of.'

Mr Sunak has set stopping small boats of asylum seekers from arriving in Britain as one of his five pledges to the electorate.

But more than 27,300 migrants have been detected making unauthorised crossings of the English Channel so far this year, according to official figures.

The Right of the Tory party has insisted Britain must leave the European human rights treaty regardless of today's outcome.

UK human rights laws need a major overhaul 'whatever the outcome' of the Government's last-ditch legal appeal, the New Conservative group of backbenchers said.

Co-chairmen of the New Conservatives Miriam Cates and Danny Kruger said in a statement they remained committed to seeing Britain leave the European Convention on Human Rights.

'We will continue to campaign for a new framework for asylum policy that fulfils our moral obligations to genuine refugees while restoring control of our borders,' they said.

'Whatever the outcome of tomorrow's judgment on the Rwanda policy, we remain of the view that the UK should reform our domestic human rights and equalities laws and leave the ECHR.'

Lord Reed, the current Deputy President of the Supreme Court will replace Lady Hale when she retires as President in January 2020

Who are the five Supreme Court judges who ruled against the Rwanda scheme?

Five Supreme Court justices decided the future of the Government's Rwanda deportation policy -

Lord Reed - President of the Supreme Court

Lord Reed, 67, (below) has led the 12-justice court since January 2020.

Over the course of more than a decade at the UK's top court, Lord Reed has been involved in some of its biggest cases, including the challenges over the prorogation of Parliament in 2019 and holding a Scottish independence referendum last year.

He previously served as a judge in Scotland and is also a member of a panel of ad hoc judges of the European Court of Human Rights.

In March last year, Lord Reed and deputy Supreme Court president Lord Hodge quit as non-permanent judges at Hong Kong' Court of Final Appeal amid concerns about the erosion of human rights.

Lord Reed was educated at the universities of Edinburgh and Oxford before qualifying as an advocate in Scotland and a barrister in England and Wales.

He has previously challenged claims that judges were meddling in political decision-making in the wake of the Supreme Court's ruling that former prime minister Boris Johnson's decision to suspend Parliament in 2019 was unlawful.

He told the BBC in October 2020: 'We don't do politics, we do decide legal questions which can have political ramifications and they can be important political consequences, but the issue we decide is strictly legal issue.'

Lord Hodge - Deputy President of the Supreme Court

Lord Hodge, 70, (below) was appointed deputy president of the UK's top court in January 2020.

The Scot, who succeeded compatriot Lord Reed when he became president, has served on the court since October 2013.

The judge was admitted to the Faculty of Advocates in 1983 and appointed a Queen's Counsel in 1996.

He has held a number of roles in Scotland, including the Scottish Judge in Exchequer Causes.

Lord Lloyd-Jones

Lord Lloyd-Jones, 71, (right) is on his second stint as a Supreme Court justice having originally served between October 2017 and January 2022.

After retiring from the role, he returned in August 2022 after an increase in the mandatory retirement age for judges from 70 to 75.

He was born and brought up in Pontypridd, South Wales, where his father was a school teacher, and was the court's first justice to come from Wales.

A Welsh speaker, he was appointed to the High Court in 2005, and acted as adviser to the court in the Pinochet litigation before the House of Lords.

He has also served as a Lord Justice of Appeal and as chairman of the Law Commission.

Lord Briggs

The Supreme Court's most senior English member, Lord Briggs, 68, (below) became a justice in October 2017.

He grew up around Portsmouth and Plymouth, following his naval officer father between ships, before spending his later childhood in West Sussex.

A keen sailor and the first lawyer in his family, he worked as a commercial lawyer before joining the High Court in 2006 where he oversaw the insolvency litigation following the collapse of the Lehman Brothers group from 2009 to 2013.

He joined the Court of Appeal in 2013 and was involved in civil justice reform, leading the Chancery Modernisation Review and Civil Courts Structure Review.

Lord Sales

Lord Sales, 61, (right) was the youngest of the court's justices when he was appointed in January 2019.

He worked as a barrister and QC before his appointment to the High Court in 2008.

He was educated at the Royal Grammar School in Guildford, before studying law at both Cambridge and Oxford universities.

He was vice-president of the Investigatory Powers Tribunal, served as deputy chairman of the Boundary Commission for England and was appointed as a Lord Justice of Appeal.

Advertisement Timeline: How did the Rwanda scheme end up before the Supreme Court?

The Supreme Court judgment on the Government's plans to removal asylum seekers to Rwanda comes more than 18 months after they were first announced.

Ongoing legal battles have meant there has yet to be any migrants sent to the East African nation under the policy.

Here is how events leading up to today's ruling have unfolded since the Rwanda plan was unveiled:

- 2022

The Supreme Court seemed ready on Tuesday to rule that the government may disarm people under domestic violence orders, limiting the sweep of last year's blockbuster decision that vastly expanded gun rights.

Several conservative justices, during a lively if largely one-sided argument, seemed to be searching for a narrow rationale that would not require them to retreat substantially from a new Second Amendment test the court announced last year in giving people a broad right to arm themselves in public. Under the new standard, the justices said courts must look to history to assess the constitutionality of gun control measures.

But conservative justices seemed prepared on Tuesday to accept that a judicial finding of dangerousness in the context of domestic violence proceedings was sufficient to support a federal law making it a crime for people subject to such orders to possess guns -- even if there was no measure from the founding era precisely like the one at issue in the case.

""Someone who poses a risk of domestic violence is dangerous,"" Justice Amy Coney Barrett said, adding that other limits on gun rights posed harder questions.

The liberal justices, by contrast, appeared to want to use the case to revisit the history-based test. ""What's the point of going to the founding era?"" Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson asked.

The ramifications of the court's decision, expected by June, could extend far beyond domestic abuse and yield a major statement on the meaning of the court's ruling last year.

Solicitor General Elizabeth B. Prelogar, defending the law, said there was ample historical precedent for disarming people who were not, in the language of earlier Second Amendment decisions, law-abiding and responsible. Only Justices Clarence Thomas and Samuel A. Alito Jr. appeared consistently skeptical of Ms. Prelogar's defense of the law, stressing that the protection order at issue was the product of an abbreviated civil proceeding.

Justice Neil M. Gorsuch, for his part, asked a series of questions sketching out a minimalist ruling upholding the law, suggesting that the case before the court was an easy one.

""We actually have a finding of a credible threat,"" he said. ""The dangerousness argument seems most apparent there.""

The two other members of the court appointed by President Donald J. Trump -- Justices Barrett and Brett M. Kavanaugh -- made similar comments. Justice Kavanaugh, for instance, noted government statistics showing that more than 75,000 attempts to buy firearms by people subject to domestic violence restraining orders were rejected under the federal background check program.

There was general agreement that the combination of domestic strife and firearms can be lethal. The Supreme Court itself recognized this in a 2014 majority opinion. ""All too often, the only difference between a battered woman and a dead woman is the presence of a gun,"" Justice Sonia Sotomayor wrote for the court, quoting a lawmaker.

The argument came as the nation grapples with a seemingly unending series of mass shootings, including a recent one in Maine that left 18 people dead.

In last year's decision, New York State Rifle & Pistol Association v. Bruen, the court struck down by a 6-to-3 vote a New York law that put strict limits on carrying guns outside the home. It also established a new legal standard, one whose reliance on historical practices has sown confusion as courts have struggled to apply it, with some judges sweeping aside gun control laws that have been on the books for decades.

The majority opinion in Bruen, written by Justice Thomas, said courts must now judge restrictions on gun rights by turning to early American history as a guide. ""The government must demonstrate,"" he wrote, ""that the regulation is consistent with this nation's historical tradition of firearm regulation.""

The new case, United States v. Rahimi, No. 22-915, gave the court a chance to explore the scope of that new test.

The case started in 2019, when Zackey Rahimi, a drug dealer in Texas, assaulted his girlfriend and threatened to shoot her if she told anyone, leading her to obtain a restraining order. The order suspended Mr. Rahimi's handgun license and prohibited him from possessing firearms.

Mr. Rahimi defied the order in flagrant fashion, according to court records.

He threatened a different woman with a gun, leading to charges of assault with a deadly weapon. Then, in the space of two months, he opened fire in public five times.

Mr. Rahimi, is ""hardly a model citizen,"" a judge on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, in New Orleans, wrote in March. But the court vacated Mr. Rahimi's conviction under a federal law that makes it a crime for people subject to domestic violence orders to have guns, ruling that the law violated the Second Amendment.

The appeals court rejected a variety of old laws identified by the government as possible historical analogues, saying they did not sufficiently resemble the one concerning domestic violence orders.

Justice Elena Kagan asked Ms. Prelogar for ""any useful guidance we can give to lower courts about the methodology that Bruen requires be used and how that applies to cases even outside of this one.""

Ms. Prelogar made three points. Courts should look to historical sources in addition to enacted laws to unearth historical understandings, she said. When considering old laws, she added, courts should look for enduring principles at a high level of generality and not fixate on minute differences between old laws and new ones.

Finally, she said, the absence of old laws should not be conclusive. ""So, for example, here we don't have a regulation disarming domestic abusers,"" she said. ""But there is nothing on the other side of the interpretive question in this case, to suggest that anyone thought you couldn't disarm domestic abusers or couldn't disarm dangerous people.""

Justice Jackson indicated that lawmakers considering enacting new gun laws should not have to perform historical research.

""Let's say I'm a legislator today in Maine, for example, and I'm very concerned about what has happened in that community and my people, the constituents, are asking me to do something,"" she told Ms. Prelogar. ""Do you read Bruen as, step one, being go to the archives and try to determine whether or not there's some historical analogue for the kinds of legislation that I'm considering?""

Ms. Prelogar responded that history counts but only to supply general principles.

Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. said there was little question that Mr. Rahimi, who has been accused of a string of shootings, posed a threat to public safety.

""You don't have any doubt that your client is a dangerous person, do you?"" the chief justice asked Mr. Rahimi's lawyer, J. Matthew Wright.

Mr. Wright said he would ""want to know what 'dangerous person' means.""

Chief Justice Roberts supplied a definition. ""It means someone who is shooting at people,"" he said. ""That's a good start.""

Mr. Wright retreated. ""That's fair,"" he said.

In general, Mr. Wright's argument was unfocused, frustrating the justices.

""I'm so confused,"" Justice Barrett said.

Chief Justice Roberts, after hearing Mr. Wright make a concession, said: ""I understand your answer to say that there will be circumstances where someone could be shown to be sufficiently dangerous that the firearm can be taken from him. And why isn't that the end of the case?""

Justice Kagan told Mr. Wright that ""I feel like you're running away from your argument.""

""You know,"" she said, ""because the implications of your argument are just so untenable, that you have to say, no, that's not really my argument.""","{'uri': 'nytimes.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'The New York Times'}","[{'uri': 'adam_liptak@nytimes.com', 'name': 'Adam Liptak', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': False}]",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2023/11/07/multimedia/07dc-scotus-01-vtgz/07dc-scotus-01-vtgz-videoSixteenByNine3000.jpg,eng-9035658,-0.1215686274509804,33,33,The New York Times,nytimes.com

Gunman Robert Card killed 18 people and injured 13 others at a bowling alley and bar on October 25 in Lewiston in the deadliest mass shooting in Maine history.

Gov. Janet Mills and Attorney General Aaron Frey created the panel with an executive order Thursday, on the same day victims and family members signaled their intent to sue with requests to 20 state and federal agencies to preserve evidence. 'As we have said, the complete facts and circumstances - including any failures or omissions - must be brought to light and known by all,' Mills and Frey said in a statement.

'The families of the victims, those who were injured, and the people of Maine and the nation deserve nothing less,' they added. It comes after reports revealed that Card's colleagues and families had repeatedly raised the alarm about threats he'd made in the months leading up to the attack. The independent panel was directed Thursday by the governor and attorney general to 'follow the facts wherever they may lead'. Members include former judges, prosecutors, and mental health professionals.

Attorneys have urged the families of the victims to seek legal justice. At a roundtable discussion on Monday, prominent attorneys Josh Koskoff of Connecticut and Jamal Alsaffar of Texas pointed out ways Lewiston families could use the civil court system to find some form of justice. Lewiston-based law firm Berman & Simmons is representing multiple victims of the Oct. 25 mass shootings, in addition to handling the estates of victims who were killed that day. 'The community of Lewiston, especially the victims and their families, have many unanswered questions. Why did this happen? How did the system fail? What changes are needed to ensure this never happens again?' said attorney Travis Brennan from Berman & Simmons, a Lewiston-based law firm.

The firm sent letters to at least 20 agencies, telling them to 'preserve all documents and information that may be relevant to the litigation of civil personal injury claims by victims of the Lewiston mass shootings.' Some of the agencies include the US Army Reserve, the Sagadahoc County Sheriff's Office, and Four Winds Hospital in New York. In the wake of the attack, text messages revealed the extent to which Maine cops were warned about mass shooter Card by his fellow servicemembers in the Army Reserves, who reported their fears six weeks before the attack that killed 18 people.

In September, Army Reservists were so concerned that Card, 40, was about to kill that they told each other to 'change the passcode' to the entrance gate of their base in Saco, and warned each other to be armed in his presence. 'Change the passcode to the unit gate and be armed if Sergeant First Class Card does arrive. Please. I believe he's messed up in the head. He added: 'Dropped him off he was concerned his weapons were still in the car...He still has all his weapons.'

In another, he said: 'I think he's going to snap and do a mass shooting.' The sergeant reported his fears to a supervisor who then notified sheriff's deputies at the Sagadahoc County Sheriff's Office. But the only thing that was done to stop Card was a File 6 alert, sent out to police departments across the state, that went largely ignored. Deputies went to his home to try to speak with him twice but were unsuccessful and on October 18, exactly a week before the massacre, the File 6 alert was canceled.

It had described him as 'armed and dangerous', telling police to exercise caution if they came across him. Maine State Police have washed their hands of the tragedy, saying they were not responsible for the alert or responding to it. An Androscoggin County Sheriff's Office deputy blasted the Maine State Police as 'utter clowns' last month for its response to the mass shooting. Now, the families of some of those killed are demanding answers as to why the police did not do more to stop Card when they had the chance.

'He should never have been out to run free, he had threatened and threatened. They can't wash it away saying we did all we could do,' Leroy Walker, whose son was among those murdered, told CBS. The 40-year-old killed himself after slaughtering 18 at the bowling alley and bar in Lewiston.

Lords Reed, Hodge, Lloyd-Jones, Briggs and Sales will hand down their verdict on the Prime Minister's legislation to remove asylum seekers to Kigali if they arrive by unauthorised means.

Should they approve the plans, 370 migrants who came to the UK in small boats could be sent to Rwanda by January, although ministers are said to be sceptical of their chances of success.

While the Government has vowed to press on with the Rwanda scheme regardless of today's outcome, defeat would be a major blow to Mr Sunak and inflame the row with Mrs Braverman, who has been sacked as home secretary.

It will also revive demands by Tory right-wingers to leave the European Convention on Human Rights.

The Supreme Court ruling on Rwanda is a momentous moment for Prime Minister Rishi Sunak

Sacked Home Secretary Suella Braverman warned he has no credible back-up to 'stop the boats'

In an excoriating letter to the Prime Minister yesterday, Mrs Braverman warned he has no 'credible Plan B' if an earlier High Court ruling that the policy is unlawful is upheld.

She claimed that even if it gets the go-ahead then Mr Sunak's 'compromises' will mean the asylum policy could be 'thwarted yet again' by the European Court of Human Rights.

Rwanda Q&A: What's happening in court today and why is it important?

What is the Rwanda policy?

The Migration and Economic Development Partnership, signed in April 2022, is effectively a one-way ticket to Rwanda for anyone who has made what the British government calls 'dangerous or illegal journeys, such as by small boat or hidden lorries' to the UK. The UK will cover the cost of Rwanda processing each deportee, with a view to them staying in the African nation.

What happened next?

The first deportees were on a plane and ready to fly to Rwanda in June 2022 until a last-minute injunction from the European Court of Human Rights. Nobody has been deported under the scheme so far.

What's happening in court?

The government has asked the UK's highest court to rule on the legality of the scheme after several lower court hearings. The Court of Appeal in June this year overturned a December 2022 High Court ruling that the deportation plan was broadly lawful, assessing that Rwanda was not a safe third country because of 'deficiencies' in its asylum system.

Those shortcomings raised the risk that claimants could be returned to their home countries where they could face persecution, in breach of Article 3 of the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) outlawing torture and inhuman treatment. 'Unless and until' those deficiencies are corrected, deportation from the UK would be unlawful, judges said.

Why is the ruling important?

Immigration was a key issue in the 2016 Brexit referendum and is likely to remain so at the next UK general election, expected at some point in 2024. Failure in the case will force the government to go back to the drawing board to try to drive down numbers, and likely trigger calls from right-wingers for the UK to withdraw from the ECHR. But even success could be problematic, with potential challenges from individuals - all with time running out until the nationwide vote.

Her replacement, James Cleverly, outlined the possible outcomes during the first meeting of the Prime Minister's new-look Cabinet after the dramatic reshuffle that saw Mrs Braverman shown the door.

Senior ministers have wargamed responses to a possible defeat, but Mrs Braverman warned of a 'betrayal' of Mr Sunak's promise to do 'whatever it takes' to stop the crossings regardless.

The sacked home secretary wrote in the letter that if they lose he will have 'wasted a year' on the Illegal Migration Act 'only to arrive back at square one'.

'Worse than this, your magical thinking - believing that you can will your way through this without upsetting polite opinion - has meant you have failed to prepare any sort of credible 'Plan B',' she said.

Even in the event of a Supreme Court victory, she said the Government 'will struggle to deliver our Rwanda partnership in the way that the public expects'.

She said the Act is 'far from secure against legal challenges' and will 'leave us vulnerable to being thwarted yet again by' the European court in Strasbourg.

Downing Street vowed to continue to work to tackle small boat crossings 'whatever the outcome' in the Supreme Court.

'The Prime Minister believes in actions, not words,' a No 10 spokeswoman said in response to Mrs Braverman's declaration of political war.

Leaving the European Convention on Human Rights was not discussed at yesterday's Cabinet meeting, the Prime Minister's official spokesman said.

Contingency plans have been 'discussed among Cabinet ministers', the spokesman said, and 'options for possible scenarios' have been prepared.

These include elevating the Rwanda deal to a treaty ratified by parliament - making it harder for the courts to block - and passing emergency legislation to disapply human rights laws.

Last month, the Home Office challenged a Court of Appeal ruling from June that overturned the High Court's finding that Rwanda could be considered a 'safe third country' for migrants.

Lawyers representing people facing deportation to the east African nation argue Rwanda is an 'authoritarian, one-party state' with a 'woefully deficient' asylum system.

But the Home Office has said the policy to remove asylum seekers to a 'country less attractive' than the UK, 'but nevertheless safe', is lawful.

Mr Sunak faces Prime Minister's Questions directly after today's ruling.

The Illegal Migration Act brought into law the Government's policy of sending some asylum seekers to Rwanda.

However, the plans announced in April 2022 have been held up in the courts, with no deportation flights having taken place despite £140 million already being handed to Kigali.

The strategy is aimed at deterring migrants from crossing the English Channel on small boats

Whereas Mrs Braverman repeatedly signalled she wanted out of the 'politicised court', Mr Cleverly said while foreign secretary in April he was 'not convinced' the move is necessary.

He said that the European countries that are not signatories - Russia and Belarus - are a 'small club', adding: 'I am not convinced it is a club we want to be part of.'

Mr Sunak has set stopping small boats of asylum seekers from arriving in Britain as one of his five pledges to the electorate.

But more than 27,300 migrants have been detected making unauthorised crossings of the English Channel so far this year, according to official figures.

The Right of the Tory party has insisted Britain must leave the European human rights treaty regardless of today's outcome.

UK human rights laws need a major overhaul 'whatever the outcome' of the Government's last-ditch legal appeal, the New Conservative group of backbenchers said.

The Supreme Court will hand down its decision this morning on the legality of the Rwanda scheme, which has twice been blocked on human rights grounds.

Co-chairmen of the New Conservatives Miriam Cates and Danny Kruger said in a statement they remained committed to seeing Britain leave the European Convention on Human Rights.

'We will continue to campaign for a new framework for asylum policy that fulfils our moral obligations to genuine refugees while restoring control of our borders,' they said.

'Whatever the outcome of tomorrow's judgment on the Rwanda policy, we remain of the view that the UK should reform our domestic human rights and equalities laws and leave the ECHR.'

Who are the five Supreme Court judges passing judgment on the Rwanda scheme?

Five Supreme Court justices are set to decide the future of the Government's Rwanda deportation policy.

The all-male panel of judges at the UK's highest court have spent about a month considering legal arguments over whether the plans are lawful or not.

Judges try to reach a unanimous decision on cases if possible, but there may be a majority ruling in favour of a particular outcome.

They can also reach different conclusions on different legal aspects of a case and there is no minimum majority required.

With their ruling due on Wednesday, the PA news agency has taken a look at the background of those behind the politically high-profile decision.

Lord Reed - President of the Supreme Court

Lord Reed, 67, who has led the 12-justice court since January 2020, is expected to be the judge who delivers a summary of the Rwanda ruling at a hearing on Wednesday.

Over the course of more than a decade at the UK's top court, Lord Reed has been involved in some of its biggest cases, including the challenges over the prorogation of Parliament in 2019 and holding a Scottish independence referendum last year.

He previously served as a judge in Scotland and is also a member of a panel of ad hoc judges of the European Court of Human Rights.

In March last year, Lord Reed and deputy Supreme Court president Lord Hodge quit as non-permanent judges at Hong Kong' Court of Final Appeal amid concerns about the erosion of human rights.

Lord Reed was educated at the universities of Edinburgh and Oxford before qualifying as an advocate in Scotland and a barrister in England and Wales.

He has previously challenged claims that judges were meddling in political decision-making in the wake of the Supreme Court's ruling that former prime minister Boris Johnson's decision to suspend Parliament in 2019 was unlawful.

He told the BBC in October 2020: 'We don't do politics, we do decide legal questions which can have political ramifications and they can be important political consequences, but the issue we decide is strictly legal issue.'

- Lord Hodge - Deputy President of the Supreme Court

Lord Hodge, 70, was appointed deputy president of the UK's top court in January 2020.

The Scot, who succeeded compatriot Lord Reed when he became president, has served on the court since October 2013.

The judge was admitted to the Faculty of Advocates in 1983 and appointed a Queen's Counsel in 1996.

He has held a number of roles in Scotland, including the Scottish Judge in Exchequer Causes.

- Lord Lloyd-Jones

Lord Lloyd-Jones, 71, is on his second stint as a Supreme Court justice having originally served between October 2017 and January 2022.

After retiring from the role, he returned in August 2022 after an increase in the mandatory retirement age for judges from 70 to 75.

He was born and brought up in Pontypridd, South Wales, where his father was a school teacher, and was the court's first justice to come from Wales.

A Welsh speaker, he was appointed to the High Court in 2005, and acted as adviser to the court in the Pinochet litigation before the House of Lords.

He has also served as a Lord Justice of Appeal and as chairman of the Law Commission.

- Lord Briggs

The Supreme Court's most senior English member, Lord Briggs, 68, became a justice in October 2017.

He grew up around Portsmouth and Plymouth, following his naval officer father between ships, before spending his later childhood in West Sussex.

A keen sailor and the first lawyer in his family, he worked as a commercial lawyer before joining the High Court in 2006 where he oversaw the insolvency litigation following the collapse of the Lehman Brothers group from 2009 to 2013.

He joined the Court of Appeal in 2013 and was involved in civil justice reform, leading the Chancery Modernisation Review and Civil Courts Structure Review.

- Lord Sales

Lord Sales, 61, was the youngest of the court's justices when he was appointed in January 2019.

He worked as a barrister and QC before his appointment to the High Court in 2008.

He was educated at the Royal Grammar School in Guildford, before studying law at both Cambridge and Oxford universities.

He was vice-president of the Investigatory Powers Tribunal, served as deputy chairman of the Boundary Commission for England and was appointed as a Lord Justice of Appeal.

The Supreme Court judgment on the Government's plans to removal asylum seekers to Rwanda comes more than 18 months after they were first announced.

Ongoing legal battles have meant there has yet to be any migrants sent to the East African nation under the policy.

Meanwhile, the Channel migrant crisis continues amid much political debate.

Here is how events leading up to the ruling from the UK's highest court on Wednesday have unfolded since the Rwanda plan was unveiled:

- 2022

April 14: Following a drastic increase in the number of people crossing the Channel, then-prime minister Boris Johnson announces a plan to deport migrants arriving in small boats to Rwanda for their claims to be processed. He says this would act as a 'very considerable deterrent'.

July 20: Despite condemnation from campaigners, sweeping asylum reforms under the Illegal Migration Bill become law after being given Royal Assent and being made an Act of Parliament. But it is unclear when the new rules will come into force.

The number of migrants crossing the Channel tops 14,000 for the year so far.

September 26: Mrs Braverman uses a speech in the United States to advocate for the United Nations' Refugee Convention to be overhauled as part of wider efforts to stop small boats crossing the Channel - comments that are rebuked by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR).

In other comments criticised by equalities campaigners, she says offering asylum to a person because they are discriminated against in their home country for being gay or a woman is not sustainable.

September 27: Asylum seekers pretend to be gay to 'game the system' and to get 'special treatment', the Home Secretary says.

October 3: Small boat arrivals in 2023 pass 25,000, figures confirm.

However Mr Justice McAlinden, who is the coroner in the case, ruled that preparation work should continue, noting legal challenges to the legislation and a potential Westminster election next year.

The nine men were shot by the SAS in the Co Armagh village in 1987 as an IRA unit carried out an attack on a police station.

Eight had been among the IRA unit, while civilian Anthony Hughes, who was travelling through the village in a car, was also shot dead.

The Northern Ireland Troubles (Legacy and Reconciliation) Act, which received royal assent earlier this year despite widespread opposition, will halt future civil cases and inquests which have not concluded by May 1 2024.

Following that date cases are to be passed to the Independent Commission for Reconciliation and Information Recovery (Icrir), led by former Northern Ireland Lord Chief Justice Sir Declan Morgan.

At an inquest preliminary hearing on Friday, Justice McAlinden said it will take six months to hear the Loughgall inquest.

He said that would mean it would have to start in November, to finish by the May deadline, which he said was not possible.

Lawyers representing the Ministry of Defence and the PSNI said work to prepare for Loughgall will have an impact on the preparation for other cases, describing a ""finite resource"".

""There are other cases listed, other cases indeed similar in nature to this that are listed and stand a prospect of being completed by May 1,"" said Peter Coll KC, acting for the MoD.

Mr Justice McAlinden said the court has to be aware of the risk of ""imposing unachievable burdens upon state agencies"", and ""potentially interfering with the successful completion of other cases.

He described a ""delicate balancing exercise"" between the need to proceed with the investigation until it is prevented from doing so, while ensuring that any direction does not ""sabotage the prospects of other case"".

Concluding, he said work needs to continue.

He said the state bodies need to reflect on what can be done, and provide a business plan of what can be done, to ensure there is ""some level of resourcing"", so that ""meaningful progress"" can be made.

""The state agencies should not simply sit on their hands and wait for that date (May 1 2024) to expire,"" he said.

""The state agencies should, in the view of this court, take steps to ensure that some meaningful progress is made.""

Mr Justice McAlinden also said there is ""no guarantee that date will remain cast in stone"", in light of legal challenges and an election next year.

""In those circumstances, to permit the downing of tools at this stage would be an abdication of this court's responsibility to ensure that these deaths are investigated and to ensure there is meaningful progress in the investigation of this matter,"" he said.

He directed that the MoD and PSNI ""come back within six weeks with proposals and business plans to ensure that in light of their other commitments, some meaningful progress can be made in relation to the Public Interest Immunity (PII) issues"".

He added: ""One cannot at this stage foresee the possible outworkings of such progress, but if such progress can benefit the families in terms of their quest for the truth in respect to these killings, can possibly inform the potential involvement of Sir Declan Morgan's body, can possibly assist in relation to the civil claim which is ongoing, I think those are all matters which the court can take into account rather than limiting utility to the issue of whether the inquest can be completed.""

Another review hearing is set to take place on December 14, which is also set to look at an ongoing civil case.","{'uri': 'dailymail.co.uk', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'Daily Mail Online'}",[],https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2023/10/27/14/wire-77081271-1698413638-298_636x382.jpg,eng-9010486,-0.08235294117647063,30,30,Daily Mail Online,dailymail.co.uk

Justin Trudeau has nominated the Alberta judge Mary Moreau to Canada's top court, setting up the first majority-female bench in the supreme court's 148-year history.

The naming of Moreau will give Canada's top court five female judges and four male judges. Moreau was most recently the chief justice of Alberta's superior court, and has worked in that court for 29 years. She will fill a vacancy on the supreme court created by the resignation of Russell Brown in June.

Born in Edmonton, Alberta, Moreau has practiced criminal law, constitutional law and civil litigation after studying at the University of Alberta and the Université de Sherbrooke in Quebec.

""A glass ceiling shattered,"" Canada's justice minister, Arif Virani, said on X, formerly known as Twitter, noting that Moreau's appointment will give the supreme court bench a majority of women for the first time in its history.

Trudeau has made Canada's top court more diverse with his recent appointments. In June 2021, Mahmud Jamal became the first judge of color to sit on the supreme court, and a year later Michelle O'Bonsawin became the first Indigenous person to join it.

""Throughout her impressive judicial career, Mary T Moreau has remained dedicated to fairness and excellence - and that's why, today, I'm announcing her nomination to the supreme court of Canada,"" Trudeau tweeted.

Eligible candidates were shortlisted by an independent, nonpartisan advisory board and handed to Trudeau, according to a statement from the prime minister's office.

The candidates needed to have the ability to work in both official languages, English and French. To fill the current vacancy, the appointment needed to be from western Canada or northern Canada to meet regional representation requirements.","{'uri': 'theguardian.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'The Guardian'}",[],https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/038e35ac16c85405e74e259dc2fc369dded68792/0_281_3500_2099/master/3500.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&s=18ce833e1a55f6f11ef86fd9bd6cdca3,eng-9006883,0.4274509803921569,30,30,The Guardian,theguardian.com

Ivanka Trump on Friday withdrew her appeal of a judge's order requiring her to testify at her father's civil fraud trial next week after an appellate court refused to pause her testimony.

She is scheduled to appear in court on Wednesday.

Ivanka Trump's testimony comes after she was previously dismissed as a co-defendant in the New York case against former President Donald Trump, two of his adult sons and his company. Multiple attempts by her legal team to delay her testimony have been rebuffed.

On Thursday night, an appeals court denied Ivanka Trump's request to postpone her testimony until her lawyers could make arguments before the panel that she shouldn't be required to appear. She had also asked the court to pause the entire fraud trial.

The former president's eldest daughter had claimed she would suffer ""undue hardship"" if she were made to testify during the school week, as she lives in Florida with three minor children. Her team has also argued that the New York civil court has no jurisdiction to compel her testimony since she is no longer a defendant in the lawsuit and does not live in New York state. New York Judge Arthur Engoron previously rejected those arguments.

Her attorneys, in dropping the appeal Friday, said it is is now ""moot"" because she is scheduled to testify on Wednesday before she can make her legal arguments.

Ivanka Trump's brothers, Donald Trump Jr. and Eric Trump, appeared in court this week. Both men helped run the Trump Organization while their father was in the White House. The former president is slated to testify on Monday.

The civil trial began in October, soon after Engoron found in September that Trump and his co-defendants were liable for ""persistent and repeated"" fraud.

A New York appeals court dismissed Ivanka Trump as a co-defendant from the suit in June, finding the claims against her were too old because she was not part of an August 2021 agreement between New York Attorney General Letitia James' office and the Trump Organization to toll the statute of limitations.

‘The judiciary is mindful that not all proceedings are suitable for live broadcasting,’ Legislative Council panel says

Hong Kong courts will start to live stream some proceedings early next year in a bid to boost public confidence in the city’s justice system.

The city’s judiciary told a Legislative Council panel on Tuesday that courts were planning to broadcast the cases deemed appropriate to the public.

“The judiciary is mindful that not all proceedings are suitable for live broadcasting,” the panel paper said. “The judiciary is examining the guiding principles as well as the implementation practicalities of live broadcasting of court proceedings.”

The plan was first announced by Chief Justice Andrew Cheung Kui-nung earlier during the opening of the legal year, with the top judge calling the move a “natural way forward”.

He added it would increase transparency and bolster confidence in the legal system.

The step will also bring Hong Kong in line with law jurisdictions in Britain, Canada, Australia, and the United States, all of which broadcast proceedings at their top courts.

The US Supreme Court only allows audio recordings of arguments during hearings as it upholds a ban on cameras in the courtroom. The High Court of Australia, meanwhile, provides audio and video recordings a day after it has finished sitting.

In January, Chief Justice Cheung said that not all trials, especially those involving a jury and vulnerable witnesses, would be suitable for live broadcasting, and suggested beginning with appellate proceedings, particularly those at the Court of Final Appeal.

But he warned that the judiciary should also consider possible misuse of broadcast trials or doxxing of judges and legal representatives.

Britain allowed cameras in a criminal trial for the first time in England and Wales in July last year, when a manslaughter case was televised.

Filming was limited to the sentencing, with only the judge appearing on camera. The British government said the move would give the public a greater understanding of the judicial process.Hong Kong judges try out AI to speed up transcribing as lawyers see its potential

Bar Association chairman Victor Dawes told the Post that he supported the judiciary’s move to further adopt technology.

“From a logistical point of view, appeal hearing may be more suitable for trial runs but the judiciary will have a better understanding on logistical issues,” he said.

Senior counsel Ronny Tong Ka-wah welcomed the move, describing it as a “good step forward”.

He suggested starting with simple criminal and civil cases without sensitive information, expressing confidence that existing restrictions would be enough to prevent footage misuse.

“As cases are open hearings anyway, the usual sanctions as to deliberate misreporting should apply. If need be, there should be clear legislative guidelines issued,” Tong said.

Separately, the judiciary said it would consult the legal profession and other court users at the end of the year on the mandatory use of its electronic case management system, inviting the profession and litigants to contribute their views on a suitable timetable, legislative amendments, exemptions and support needed to make the electronic system a default in the city’s proceedings.

Since last year, e-filing of legal papers has been allowed at the District Court for personal injury cases, tax claims, civil action and employees’ compensation cases, and simple cases at the Magistrates’ Courts involving summonses.

Law firms and litigants must be registered on the electronic case management system to file legal documents and make payments online, instead of using over-the-counter services at city courts.Courting technology: why some Hong Kong lawyers are slow to go paperless

The judiciary administrator added that by the end of October, 350 court users, including 283 law firms, registered accounts under the electronic system, a sharp increase from 43 law firms reported in February.

The system also handled 24.2 per cent of eligible cases between last May and October this year, according to the judiciary.

Starting next year, the judiciary will “incrementally” roll out the electronic system to the Court of Final Appeal, the High Court, non-summons cases at Magistrates’ Courts and the Small Claims Tribunal.","{'uri': 'scmp.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'South China Morning Post'}",[],https://cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/d8/images/canvas/2023/11/21/d19e7d02-c5eb-4b30-aeac-c6cba5c53be4_51431bc2.jpg?itok=OwiUt10y,,0.3411764705882352,26,26,South China Morning Post,scmp.com

A unanimous three-judge panel of the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals said that because deportation proceedings are civil and not criminal, non-citizens are not entitled to Miranda warnings typically recited by police during a criminal arrest regardless of whether a warrant is involved.

The court upheld an order to deport Jose Maria Zuniga De La Cruz, a Mexican citizen who had sought to block the fact that he had admitted to immigration officers that he was in the United States illegally from being used as evidence in his case.

The U.S. Department of Justice and a lawyer for Zuniga did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

The 1966 U.S. Supreme Court decision in Miranda v. Arizona says prosecutors cannot use criminal defendants' statements against them unless they were first informed of their constitutional rights to counsel and against self-incrimination.

At least seven appeals courts, including the 9th Circuit, have ruled that Miranda does not apply to civil immigration proceedings.

Zuniga, who had been in the United States since 2004, was arrested outside of his home in 2018 by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officers who had obtained an administrative warrant. The officers said Zuniga admitted that he was in the U.S. illegally.

Unlike criminal arrest warrants, which must be signed by a judge, administrative warrants are approved by an ICE official based on evidence that a person is illegally present in the country.

Zuniga said the statements he made to the officers were coerced and he moved to suppress them, claiming that Miranda applied to his case. He argued that an arrest backed by an administrative warrant is ""closer to a criminal arrest,"" according to Friday's decision.

An immigration judge denied the motion and ordered Zuniga to be deported, and the U.S. Board of Immigration Appeals affirmed. The 9th Circuit on Friday rejected Zuniga's appeal.

""It is the nature of the proceeding in which the inculpatory statements are to be used and not the nature of the arrest that is relevant,"" Circuit Judge Daniel Bress wrote.

Circuit Judge Salvador Mendoza in a concurring opinion agreed that Miranda did not apply to civil proceedings. But non-citizens have constitutional rights, he wrote, and the 9th Circuit should consider adopting a similar requirement for deportation cases.

""Though Mr. Zuniga's Miranda argument fails, it raises important questions: when should immigration officers advise noncitizens of their rights, and what exactly should this prophylactic warning look like?"" wrote Mendoza, an appointee of President Joe Biden.

Bress, who was appointed by Republican former President Donald Trump, in response to Mendoza said there was no legal basis to grant those rights.

""Miranda, which does not apply here, is not authority for creating new versions of itself in the immigration context,"" he wrote.

The panel also included U.S. District Judge Joan Ericksen of the District of Minnesota, who sat by designation.

The case is Zuniga De La Cruz v. Garland, 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, No. 21-352.

His team accuses the judge of tainting the proceedings with ""tangible and overwhelming"" bias.

In urging Judge Arthur Engoron to stop the case immediately, they argued he had irreparably harmed Trump's right to a fair trial through ""astonishing departures from ordinary standards of impartiality."" They cited his rulings against their client as well as the prominent role played by the judge's chief law clerk.

Engoron gave lawyers who are presenting New York Attorney General Letitia James´ lawsuit until Thursday to decide whether they will file a response before he rules.

Trump, the front-runner for the 2024 Republican presidential nomination, has long complained about Engoron, a Democrat. Trump was incensed by a gag order that judge imposed last month at the start of the trial and by a pretrial ruling that could force Trump to surrender control of some marquee properties.

Testifying last week, Trump assailed Engoron as an ""extremely hostile"" judge and the trial as ""very unfair.""

Trump´s lawyers compiled weeks of complaints into their 30-page court filing seeking a mistrial. ""The only way to maintain public confidence in a truly independent and impartial judiciary and the rule of law is to bring these proceedings to an immediate halt,"" they wrote.

Engoron mentioned the mistrial request only briefly in court Wednesday as defense lawyers continued calling witnesses.

James' office said in a statement that Trump was ""trying to dismiss the truth and the facts, but the numbers and evidence don´t lie."" It said Trump ""is now being held accountable for the years of fraud he committed and the incredible ways he lied to enrich himself and his family. He can keep trying to distract from his fraud, but the truth always comes out.""

James, a Democrat, alleges Trump, his company and top executives exaggerated his wealth by billions of dollars on his financial statements by inflating property values. The documents were given to banks, insurers and others to secure loans and make deals. James is seeking more than $300 million in what she says were ill-gotten gains. She wants the defendants, who include Trump sons Donald Jr. and Eric Trump, banned from doing business in New York.

Before the trial, Engoron ruled that Trump and other defendants committed fraud by exaggerating his net worth and the value of assets on his financial statements. The judge ordered that a receiver take control of some of Trump´s assets. An appeals court is keeping them in his control for now.

Trump´s lawyers had suggested for weeks that they would ask for a mistrial, first raising the issue after the conservative news site Breitbart News published a citizen complaint in early November that accused Engoron´s chief law clerk, Allison Greenfield, of violating court rules by making monetary donations to Democratic causes. Many of those contributions were made when Greenfield, a Democrat, was running for a judicial position in 2022.

Greenfield, who sits alongside Engoron in the courtroom, has been a flashpoint since the trial started Oct. 2. Trump made a disparaging social media post about her on the trial´s second day, leading Engoron to impose a limited gag order barring participants in the case from smearing court staff.

Engoron fined Trump $15,000 for twice violating the order and expanded it on Nov. 3 to include Trump´s lawyers after they complained in court about Greenfield passing notes to Engoron. Trump lawyer Christopher Kise said he felt like he was ""fighting two adversaries."" The judge said he had ""an absolutely unfettered right"" to her advice.

In their mistrial motion, Trump´s lawyers accused Engoron of letting Greenfield act as ""a de facto co-judge,"" and they questioned whether her political leanings were influencing what they perceived as a ""demonstrable pro-Attorney General and antiTrump/big real estate bias.""

Trump´s lawyers complained that Engoron´s expanded gag order barring comments about Greenfield ""interferes with counsel´s ability to zealously advocate for their clients.""

A spokesperson for the state´s court system declined comment on behalf of Engoron and Greenfield, citing ""active, ongoing litigation.""

State ethics rules bar members of a judge´s staff from making more than $500 in political donations in a single year. There are exceptions when a staff member is running for a seat on the bench.

In that case, they are allowed to exceed the cap to purchase tickets to political events, as long as they do not buy more than more than two per event and the cost per ticket is not more than $250.

Greenfield ran for a civil court judgeship in Manhattan in 2022. Her contributions, which totaled more than $4,000 during that time, appear to have gone primarily to buy tickets to events hosted by local Democratic clubs.

Judicial candidates in New York are widely expected to attend those events, which are seen as helpful to getting the party´s endorsement. Legal experts say candidates have an ethical duty to pay to attend the events, rather than accept free tickets.

""If she hadn´t paid, that would be a problem,"" said Jerry Goldfeder, a veteran New York election lawyer and director of Fordham Law School´s Voting Rights and Democracy Project.

Goldfeder said the defense´s allegations were ""totally misplaced,"" suggesting Trump´s legal team ""either doesn´t understand the law or doesn´t care about it.""

Mr Anderson said the Government should simply 'ignore the laws' and 'just put the planes in the air now and send them [migrants] to Rwanda'.

It comes after Supreme Court judges dramatically ruling the plan was illegal.

Mr Anderson described the judgment as a 'dark day for the British people' and said ministers should 'just put the planes in the air now and send them to Rwanda'.

'I think the British people have been very patient, I've been very patient, and now they're demanding action. And this has sort of forced our hand a little bit now,' he said.

'My take is we should just put the planes in the air now and send them to Rwanda and show strength.

'It's time for the Government to show real leadership and send them back, same day.'

Speaking at a press conference in No10, Mr Sunak said he 'absolutely' shared the 'frustrations' of colleagues and people across the country over the situation.

Asked whether he would sack Mr Anderson over the remarks, Mr Sunak told a press conference at Downing Street: 'I think what Lee's comments and indeed the comments of others do is reflect the strength of feeling in the country on this issue.

'And I absolutely share actually in the frustrations that my colleagues and indeed people across the country have about this issue. Everyone should understand the strength of feeling.'

Meanwhile, former Prime Minister Boris Johnson urged Mr Sunak to get Parliament to designate Rwanda a 'safe' country.

He highlighted a Daily Mail column in which he argued that the Asylum and Immigration Act 2004 include powers to make the change.

In his press conference, Mr Sunak vowed to end the political and legal 'merry-go-round' on the plan, pledging a new treaty with the East African country and emergency legislation allowing Parliament to declare that it is safe for asylum seekers.

And in a nod to the fury of the Tory Right he insisted if that failed he is ready to ignore the European Convention on Human Rights rather than let 'foreign courts' stand in the way of action.

Planes should start leaving for Rwanda next Spring, he said - although he would not guarantee the timetable. That would potentially be just months before a general election.

'Let me tell everyone now - I will not allow a foreign court to block these flights,' Mr Sunak said.

'If the Strasbourg Court chooses to intervene against the express wishes of Parliament I am prepared to do whatever is necessary to get flights off.

'I will not take the easy way out.'

The premier said he disagreed with the decision, but 'respected' it.

What is the PM's plan for finally getting Rwanda flights going?

1. Ratify a new Treaty with Rwanda that will guarantee asylum seekers sent there from the UK are not returned to danger in their country of origin.

2. Parliament passes 'emergency legislation' formally designating Rwanda as a safe country.

3. If 'foreign courts' are still posing a problem the government is ready to ignore, water down or force reforms to the European Convention on Human Rights and UN Refugee Convention.

4. Flights carrying asylum seekers should start taking off by the Spring, although the PM refused to guarantee that timetable.

He said once Parliament approved a new Treaty that will guarantee people sent to Rwanda are not returned to danger in their country of origin that must be the end of the matter. He warned that Brits' 'patience has worn thin' with the failure to tackle the Channel boat situation.

The comments were immediately dismissed by Suella Braverman's allies as just another version of the previous strategy.

In a statement, New Conservative co-chairmen Danny Kruger and Miriam Cates said: 'The Bill must disapply the Human Rights Act and ... restate the power of government to disregard interim rulings from Strasbourg.

'We have no time left. This Bill - which must come to Parliament within weeks - must have everything in it to ensure that flights are in the air within months.'

It came after the Supreme Court concluded unanimously that the scheme to deport arrivals immediately would break the law. It is a crushing blow to the government, which has already handed Rwanda £140million.

The decision - which ministers had feared for weeks was coming - immediately sparked Tory demands to loosen protections under the ECHR so the policy can go ahead.

However, critics pointed out the judgment suggested it would have been struck out on other grounds anyway. The case hinged on whether asylum seekers sent to Rwanda would be at 'real risk' of being returned to their country of origin and subject to mistreatment.

Mr Sunak denied that the government's handling of illegal immigration was a 'shambles'.

'We've made more progress in the past year than any Government has in any year since this small boats phenomenon came upon us, and I'm confident that we will keep making progress,' he said.

'But getting Rwanda working is an important part of completing the job, having the deterrence effect that we need. And as I said, legislation will help us do that. We are responding to the Supreme Court. As I said, I don't agree with the decision, but I respect it and accept it. Rule of law is fundamental to our democracy.'

At a PMQs session earlier, Mr Sunak tried to put a brave face on the Supreme Court's ruling, stressing that the principle of deporting asylum seekers to a safe third country had been upheld.

But Home Secretary James Cleverly risked further enraging right-wingers by insisting is it 'not necessary' to ditch the European Convention on Human Rights or UN Refugee Convention in order to 'take back control of our borders'.

Making a statement to MPs after PMQs, Mr Cleverly said the ruling was a 'temporary setback' and the upgraded treaty with Rwanda - which could come before Parliament in days - would toughen rules against repatriating asylum seekers.

During bruising clashes shadow home secretary Yvette Cooper swiped that ministers knew the policy was 'batsh**'.

Mr Cleverly's predecessor Ms Braverman has already launched an excoriating attack on Mr Sunak's failure to do what it takes to tackle the Channel crisis, warning he has no 'credible Plan B'.

An ally of Ms Braverman said: 'This is a treaty which he's putting in legislation - it's just another version of Plan A. He'll be stuck in the courts again. More magic tricks from Rishi's magical thinking.'

Even if the government is able to tweak the plan to the satisfaction of the courts MPs fear it could not happen in time to take effect before the election next year.

Justices at the UK's highest court upheld an earlier High Court judgment on legislation announced 18 months ago to send asylum seekers who arrive in the UK by unauthorised means to Kigali to have their claims heard there.

In a summary of today's momentous ruling, President of the Supreme Court Lord Reed said there would be a risk of genuine asylum seekers being returned by Rwanda to the home country they fled from.

Ministers have vowed to press on with the scheme regardless of the result today, with options including elevating the Rwanda deal to a treaty ratified in parliament - making it harder for the courts to block - and passing emergency legislation to disapply human rights laws.

Making a statement to the Commons, Mr Cleverly said: 'Nothing in the Supreme Court judgment today dims our commitment.

'The Supreme Court has said there are issues with Rwanda's asylum system which could create the possibility of someone being returned to a country where they could face persecution.'

The Tory graphics included the claim that they will 'put Parliament back in charge'

Mr Cleverly added the UK Government has a plan to address the concerns raised, noting: 'We anticipated this judgment as a possible result and for the last few months have been working on a plan to provide the certainty that the court demands.

'We have been working with Rwanda to build capacity and amend agreements with Rwanda to make clear that those sent there cannot be sent to another country than the UK.

What is the European Convention on Human Rights?

After the darkest days of the Second World War, political leaders including Winston Churchill advocated for a Council of Europe (CoE) to oversee a charter of human rights.

This led to the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) being signed in 1950. Its drafting was led by Conservative MP Sir David Maxwell-Fyfe and the UK was among the first to ratify the international treaty.

Today the legal commitment signs up all 46 CoE members to abide by rules on rights to life, liberty and expression, and protection from torture, degrading treatment and slavery.

It is not linked to the European Union, so Brexit did not affect the UK's obligations.

The European Court of Human Rights, in Strasbourg, makes binding judgments on the Convention.

'Our intention is to upgrade our agreement to a treaty as soon as possible. That will make it absolutely clear to our courts and to Strasbourg that the risks laid out by the court today have been responded to, will be consistent with international law and ensure that Parliament is able to scrutinise it.'

Ex-minister Jonathan Gullis challenged Mr Cleverly on whether he was 'willing to disapply international treaties and conventions such as the ECHR and the Refugee Convention in order to take back control of our borders, yes or no?'

Mr Cleverly responded: 'I don't believe those things are necessary.'

Tory MP Caroline Johnson said her constituents were disappointed by the court's ruling, adding: 'I understand his plan is to upgrade the treaty with Rwanda, can he advise the House how long will that take? Will that be potentially subject to legal challenge? And if so, how long could those legal challenges take?'

Mr Cleverly said he was not able to give certainty on timelines, and added: 'I wish that I could.'

Tory MP David Jones said: 'He's told the House that his department had anticipated the decision of the Supreme Court that was announced today, that being the case can he tell the House if he's made an assessment as to whether legislation will be necessary in order to remedy the problems that have been identified? And if so, when would he anticipate being in a position to introduce that legislation?'

In response, the Home Secretary said: 'We have already set in place the work to turn the MoU (memorandum of understanding) into a treaty, thus by addressing some of the concerns of their Lordships.

'The Prime Minister and I have made it clear if there needs to be legislative work domestically in order to ensure we do this, we are unafraid of bringing that forward.'

Ex-PM Theresa May pointed out that the 'fundamental judgment' made by the Supreme Court on the Rwanda policy was made 'regardless of the ECHR'.

Downing Street said a new treaty with Rwanda would be laid in Parliament in the 'coming days' that the UK Government believes 'addresses concerns raised by the court'.

However, it could take more than 40 sitting days to be approved, meaning that would happen well into next year at best.

The Prime Minister's official spokesman said: 'We will lay the treaty in Parliament in the coming days so that flights can commence as soon as possible.

'Obviously the text will be set out when it is published. I'm not going to pre-empt the text itself.

'But we believe it will provide the reassurances that the court has asked for.'

'We plan to lay a treaty which seeks to address the concerns raised by the court. At the same time, as the Prime Minister set out, if necessary we are prepared to revisit our domestic legal frameworks and international conventions as necessary.'

Mr Sunak spoke to Rwandan President Paul Kagame this morning following the judgment.

The PM 'expressed his disappointment at the overall outcome and recognised that there are challenges we must overcome', according to a No10 readout.

'He thanked President Kagame for his Government's work over the last 15 months and the extra assurances we have already agreed as they said they would continue to work together to address the Court's concerns,' the readout said.

'Both leaders reiterated their firm commitment to making our migration partnership work and agreed to take the necessary steps to ensure this is a robust and lawful policy and to stop the boats as soon as possible.'

Outside the Commons, former Cabinet minister Sir Simon Clarke told Sky News that the UK should now consider leaving the ECHR.

'Today is a really serious challenge to who governs Britain and whether Parliament can deliver, when we say we want to address what is clearly, by anyone's standards, an unsustainable level of illegal immigration,' he said.

'For my part I think the gauntlet has now been thrown down and we are going to have to pass emergency legislation - at a minimum - to set out that the will of parliament will apply, notwithstanding the ECHR and the associated conventions that the justices referenced. But we may also have to consider, if that is not legally viable, withdrawal from the ECHR.'

He added: 'This is about whether Britain as a nation state can control who comes to this country and on what terms. It is a fundamental element of whether we are in practice able to govern Britain properly. And if our human rights framework makes that impossible then I am afraid it is the human rights framework that is going to have to change, rather than the policy.'

The New Conservatives group of Tory MPs said ministers must introduce legislation 'immediately' to override the ECHR.

Speaking after a meeting of the group with other Conservatives who share the same view, co-chair Danny Kruger said the Supreme Court judgment felt 'absolutely existential' for the party.

Options being suggested by the New Conservatives are a 'notwithstanding clause' to disapply the ECHR or initiating complete withdrawal from the ECHR.

He said the scope of the ruling meant that the UK's involvement in other treaties and conventions also needs to be considered.

'The Government should immediately announce an intention to do what is necessary to insist on our sovereignty. That means legislation to over-ride the effect of the European court, of the ECHR itself and of other conventions including the Refugee Convention if necessary.'

He added: 'This feels absolutely existential for our party ... if this Government will not step up to do whatever it takes to do what the Prime Minister has promised he will, there is no reason for the public to trust us again.'

Dover's Tory MP Natalie Elphicke has said a deal with France is now the best way to stop small boats crossing the English Channel.

She said the Supreme Court's ruling on Rwanda 'means the policy is effectively at an end'.

'No planes will be leaving and we now need to move forward,' she said.

'With winter coming, the timing of this decision couldn't be worse. Be in no doubt, this will embolden the people smugglers and put more lives at risk.

'A fresh policy is now needed: a new cross-channel agreement with France to stop the boats leaving and return those that do to the safety of the French coast. That should be David Cameron's top foreign policy priority.'

Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby said he hoped the Supreme Court ruling would cause the Government to 'reflect and reconsider its approach'.

Mr Welby said the Church of England had 'been clear in our profound concerns - moral and practical - about outsourcing our obligations to refugees to Rwanda'.

He added: 'We have been clear that the inefficiencies of our asylum system and its failure to treat all people with compassion and dignity must be addressed. Today's decision by the Supreme Court leaves our response to desperate people fleeing conflict and persecution in a state of limbo. I hope this judgment will give the Government the opportunity to reflect and reconsider its approach.'

Unveiling the judgment, Lord Reed said the 'legal test' in the case was whether there were 'substantial grounds' for believing that asylum seekers sent to Rwanda would be at 'real risk' of being sent back to the countries they came from where they could face 'ill treatment'.

He said: 'In the light of the evidence which I have summarised, the Court of Appeal concluded that there were such grounds.

'We are unanimously of the view that they were entitled to reach that conclusion. Indeed, having been taken through the evidence ourselves, we agree with their conclusion.'

Reacting to the news, Mr Sunak said today: 'We have seen today's judgment and will now consider next steps.

'This was not the outcome we wanted, but we have spent the last few months planning for all eventualities and we remain completely committed to stopping the boats.

'Crucially, the Supreme Court - like the Court of Appeal and the High Court before it - has confirmed that the principle of sending illegal migrants to a safe third country for processing is lawful. This confirms the Government's clear view from the outset.

'Illegal migration destroys lives and costs British taxpayers millions of pounds a year. We need to end it and we will do whatever it takes to do so.

'Because when people know that if they come here illegally, they won't get to stay then they will stop coming altogether, and we will stop the boats.'

In their ruling, which the other justices agreed with, Lords Reed and Lloyd-Jones said Rwanda's history 'cannot be effectively ignored or sidelined' as the Home Office suggested.

The justices said there was 'no dispute' that the Rwandan government entered into its deal with the UK in good faith, with strong incentives to follow the terms of the arrangement.

They continued: 'Nevertheless, intentions and aspirations do not necessarily correspond to reality: the question is whether they are achievable in practice.

'The central issue in the present case is therefore not the good faith of the government of Rwanda at the political level, but its practical ability to fulfil its assurances, at least in the short term, in the light of the present deficiencies of the Rwandan asylum system.

'In agreement with the Court of Appeal, we consider that the past and the present cannot be effectively ignored or sidelined as the Secretary of State suggests.'

In a 56-page judgment dismissing the Home Office's appeal, Lords Reed and Lloyd-Jones said the High Court had wrongly dismissed the evidence of the UN Refugee Agency, the UNHCR, about problems with the Rwandan asylum system.

They said: 'UNHCR's evidence will naturally be of greatest weight when it relates to matters within its particular remit or where it has special expertise in the subject matter.

'Its evidence in the present case concerns matters falling within its remit and about which it has undoubted expertise.'

The Supreme Court justices said there was 'evidence of a culture within Rwanda of, at best, inadequate understanding of Rwanda's obligations under the Refugee Convention'.

Lord Reed added that changes needed in Rwanda's asylum system to 'eliminate the risk' of refugees being returned to their countries of origin where they could face bad treatment 'have not been shown to be in place now'.

He said there was a legal rule that 'refugees must not be returned to their countries of origin, either directly or indirectly, if their life or freedom would be threatened in that country'.

'That rule is called the principle of non-refoulement,' he said.

The president of the UK's highest court added: 'We accept the Home Secretary's submission that the Rwandan government entered into the agreement in good faith and that the capacity of the Rwandan system to produce accurate and fair decisions can and will be built up.

How can Parliament declare Rwanda a 'safe' country?

Rishi Sunak tonight promised to bring forward emergency laws in the wake of the Supreme Court's block on the Rwanda migration plan.

The Prime Minister said the 'extraordinary step' would allow Parliament to declare Rwanda a 'safe' country to send asylum seekers to, once he has agreed a new treaty with Kigali.

Mr Sunak said: 'It will ensure that people cannot further delay flights by bringing systemic challenges in our domestic courts and stop our policy being repeatedly blocked.'

The PM's plan seems to be based on a detail included in the Court of Appeal's initial ruling, back in June, that the Rwanda scheme is unlawful.

Judges noted how Schedule 3 to the Asylum and Immigration (Treatment of Claimants) Act 2004 allows the Government, as long as it obtains Parliamentary approval, to designate particular countries as safe.

But ministers did not do so in its efforts to send migrants to Rwanda.

Former PM Boris Johnson, who first announced the Rwanda plan in April last year, highlighted this in the wake of the Court of Appeal's ruling.

He wrote in a Daily Mail column in June: 'As the judgment points out, the Government has the power, under Schedule 3 of the Asylum and Immigration Act 2004, to ask ­Parliament to deem Rwanda a safe country.

'That has not so far been done and it should now be done - immediately. Yes, of course there would be a row.

'The House of Lords might well be difficult - but we have been here before. It is time for the Government to settle the legal position.'

Mr Johnson urged Mr Sunak to follow his advice after the Supreme Court upheld the Court of Appeal's decision.

'There is only one way to end the legal blockade on Rwanda - and that is to do exactly what this piece proposes - and do it NOW,' Mr Johnson posted on Twitter, as he shared a link to his past article.

'If you want to know what the government of 2019-2022 would have done, here is your answer. It's the only way.'

'Nevertheless, asking ourselves whether there were substantial grounds for believing that a real risk of refoulement existed at the relevant time, we have concluded that there were.

'The changes needed to eliminate the risk of refoulement may be delivered in the future, but they have not been shown to be in place now.'

Lord Reed said in his summary that the European Convention on Human Rights was not the only international treaty that was relevant to the Rwanda case.

He added: 'There are other international treaties which also prohibit the return of asylum seekers to their countries of origin without a proper examination of their claims.'

These included the the United Nations (UN) Refugee Convention, the UN Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment and the UN International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, he said.

Following this morning's ruling, the Liberal Democrats urged the government abandon the 'immoral, unworkable and incredibly costly' Rwanda scheme and 'get on with fixing the broken asylum system'.

Major of London Sadiq Khan said: 'The Government's Rwanda policy isn't just cruel, callous and morally reprehensible, the Supreme Court has today confirmed its unlawful too.'

Scotland's First Minister Humza Yousaf said the Rwanda scheme was 'morally repugnant' and 'should be scrapped'.

Human rights groups including Amnesty International and The Refugee Council hailed the Supreme Court's decision.

Sonya Sceats, chief executive at charity Freedom from Torture said: 'This is a victory for reason and compassion. 'We are delighted that the Supreme Court has affirmed what caring people already knew: the UK Government's 'cash for humans' deal with Rwanda is not only deeply immoral, but it also flies in the face of the laws of this country.'

Steve Smith, CEO of refugee charity Care4Calais, said: 'The Supreme Court's judgment is a victory for humanity. This grubby, cash-for-people deal was always cruel and immoral, but, most importantly, it is unlawful.'

He added: 'Today's judgment should bring this shameful mark on the UK's history to a close.

'Never again should our Government seek to shirk our country's responsibility to offer sanctuary to those caught up in horrors around the world.

'All the architects of the Rwanda plan may be gone but unless the Government changes course and introduces a policy of safe passage, then the rest should follow them out the door. There can be no more time wasted attacking the vulnerable when all they seek is our help.'

In an excoriating letter to the Prime Minister yesterday, Mrs Braverman warned he has no 'credible Plan B' if an earlier High Court ruling that the policy is unlawful is upheld.

As of November 12, 27,284 people had crossed the Channel.

Meanwhile, the 'legacy' backlog of UK asylum applications stood at 33,253 as of October 29, down nearly a half (47%) from 62,157 on July 30, according to new figures from the Home Office.

Mrs Braverman's replacement, James Cleverly , outlined the possible outcomes during the first meeting of the Prime Minister's new-look Cabinet after the dramatic reshuffle that saw Mrs Braverman shown the door

Mrs Braverman's replacement, James Cleverly, outlined the possible outcomes during the first meeting of the Prime Minister's new-look Cabinet after the dramatic reshuffle that saw Mrs Braverman shown the door.

Senior ministers had wargamed responses to a defeat, but Mrs Braverman warned of a 'betrayal' of Mr Sunak's promise to do 'whatever it takes' to stop the crossings regardless.

Asylum backlog falls by half - but 16,630 applications would need to be cleared each MONTH to meet ministers' deadline

The 'legacy' backlog of UK asylum applications stood at 33,253 as of October 29, down nearly a half (47%) from 62,157 on July 30, according to new figures from the Home Office.

Asylum applications made before June 28 2022 are counted as legacy cases. The Government has pledged to clear the legacy backlog by the end of this year. To do so, around 16,630 applications would need to be cleared per month before December 31.

Some 12,620 were cleared between September 24 and October 29, and 9,604 cleared between August 27 and September 24, figures show.

The non-legacy backlog of UK asylum cases - covering applications made on or after June 28 2022 - stood at 89,332 on October 29, up 20% from 74,622 on July 30.

The overall backlog of applications awaiting a decision, including both legacy and non-legacy cases, is 122,585: down 10% from 136,779 on July 30 and down 12% from a record 138,782 at the end of February. One asylum application does not always equal one individual, as an application can cover a group of people.

The sacked Home Secretary wrote in the letter that if they lose he will have 'wasted a year' on the Illegal Migration Act 'only to arrive back at square one'.

'Worse than this, your magical thinking - believing that you can will your way through this without upsetting polite opinion - has meant you have failed to prepare any sort of credible 'Plan B',' she said.

Downing Street has vowed to continue to work to tackle small boat crossings 'whatever the outcome' in the Supreme Court.

'The Prime Minister believes in actions, not words,' a No 10 spokeswoman said in response to Mrs Braverman's declaration of political war.

Leaving the European Convention on Human Rights was not discussed at yesterday's Cabinet meeting, the Prime Minister's official spokesman said.

Contingency plans have been 'discussed among Cabinet ministers', the spokesman said, and 'options for possible scenarios' have been prepared.

Last month, the Home Office challenged a Court of Appeal ruling from June that overturned the High Court's finding that Rwanda could be considered a 'safe third country' for migrants.

Lawyers representing people facing deportation to the east African nation argued Rwanda is an 'authoritarian, one-party state' with a 'woefully deficient' asylum system.

But the Home Office has said the policy to remove asylum seekers to a 'country less attractive' than the UK, 'but nevertheless safe', is lawful.

The Illegal Migration Act brought into law the Government's policy of sending some asylum seekers to Rwanda.

However, the plans announced in April 2022 have been held up in the courts, with no deportation flights having taken place despite £140 million already being handed to Kigali.

Whereas Mrs Braverman repeatedly signalled she wanted out of the 'politicised court', Mr Cleverly said while foreign secretary in April he was 'not convinced' the move is necessary.

He said that the European countries that are not signatories - Russia and Belarus - are a 'small club', adding: 'I am not convinced it is a club we want to be part of.'

Mr Sunak has set stopping small boats of asylum seekers from arriving in Britain as one of his five pledges to the electorate.

But more than 27,300 migrants have been detected making unauthorised crossings of the English Channel so far this year, according to official figures.

The Right of the Tory party has insisted Britain must leave the European human rights treaty regardless of today's outcome.

UK human rights laws need a major overhaul 'whatever the outcome' of the Government's last-ditch legal appeal, the New Conservative group of backbenchers said.

Co-chairmen of the New Conservatives Miriam Cates and Danny Kruger said in a statement they remained committed to seeing Britain leave the European Convention on Human Rights.

'We will continue to campaign for a new framework for asylum policy that fulfils our moral obligations to genuine refugees while restoring control of our borders,' they said.

'Whatever the outcome of tomorrow's judgment on the Rwanda policy, we remain of the view that the UK should reform our domestic human rights and equalities laws and leave the ECHR.'

Who are the five Supreme Court judges who ruled against the Rwanda scheme?

Five Supreme Court justices decided the future of the Government's Rwanda deportation policy -

Lord Reed - President of the Supreme Court

Lord Reed, 67, (below) has led the 12-justice court since January 2020.

Over the course of more than a decade at the UK's top court, Lord Reed has been involved in some of its biggest cases, including the challenges over the prorogation of Parliament in 2019 and holding a Scottish independence referendum last year.

He previously served as a judge in Scotland and is also a member of a panel of ad hoc judges of the European Court of Human Rights.

In March last year, Lord Reed and deputy Supreme Court president Lord Hodge quit as non-permanent judges at Hong Kong' Court of Final Appeal amid concerns about the erosion of human rights.

Lord Reed was educated at the universities of Edinburgh and Oxford before qualifying as an advocate in Scotland and a barrister in England and Wales.

He has previously challenged claims that judges were meddling in political decision-making in the wake of the Supreme Court's ruling that former prime minister Boris Johnson's decision to suspend Parliament in 2019 was unlawful.

He told the BBC in October 2020: 'We don't do politics, we do decide legal questions which can have political ramifications and they can be important political consequences, but the issue we decide is strictly legal issue.'

Lord Hodge - Deputy President of the Supreme Court

Lord Hodge, 70, (below) was appointed deputy president of the UK's top court in January 2020.

The Scot, who succeeded compatriot Lord Reed when he became president, has served on the court since October 2013.

The judge was admitted to the Faculty of Advocates in 1983 and appointed a Queen's Counsel in 1996.

He has held a number of roles in Scotland, including the Scottish Judge in Exchequer Causes.

Lord Lloyd-Jones

Lord Lloyd-Jones, 71, (right) is on his second stint as a Supreme Court justice having originally served between October 2017 and January 2022.

After retiring from the role, he returned in August 2022 after an increase in the mandatory retirement age for judges from 70 to 75.

He was born and brought up in Pontypridd, South Wales, where his father was a school teacher, and was the court's first justice to come from Wales.

A Welsh speaker, he was appointed to the High Court in 2005, and acted as adviser to the court in the Pinochet litigation before the House of Lords.

He has also served as a Lord Justice of Appeal and as chairman of the Law Commission.

Lord Briggs

The Supreme Court's most senior English member, Lord Briggs, 68, (below) became a justice in October 2017.

He grew up around Portsmouth and Plymouth, following his naval officer father between ships, before spending his later childhood in West Sussex.

A keen sailor and the first lawyer in his family, he worked as a commercial lawyer before joining the High Court in 2006 where he oversaw the insolvency litigation following the collapse of the Lehman Brothers group from 2009 to 2013.

He joined the Court of Appeal in 2013 and was involved in civil justice reform, leading the Chancery Modernisation Review and Civil Courts Structure Review.

Lord Sales

Lord Sales, 61, (right) was the youngest of the court's justices when he was appointed in January 2019.

He worked as a barrister and QC before his appointment to the High Court in 2008.

He was educated at the Royal Grammar School in Guildford, before studying law at both Cambridge and Oxford universities.

He was vice-president of the Investigatory Powers Tribunal, served as deputy chairman of the Boundary Commission for England and was appointed as a Lord Justice of Appeal.","{'uri': 'dailymail.co.uk', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'Daily Mail Online'}",[],https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2023/11/15/19/77845221-0-image-a-15_1700076914772.jpg,eng-9058323,0.1607843137254903,26,26,Daily Mail Online,dailymail.co.uk

At a press conference in No10, the PM pledged a new treaty with the country and said Parliament will declare that it is safe for asylum seekers.

He insisted if that failed he is ready to ditch the European Convention on Human rights rather than let foreign courts stand in the way of action. Planes should start leaving for Rwanda next Spring, he said - potentially just months before a general election.

'Let me tell everyone now - I will not allow a foreign court to block these flights,' Mr Sunak said.

'If the Strasbourg Court chooses to intervene against the express wishes of Parliament I am prepared to do what necessary to get flights off.

'I will not take the easy way out.'

Mr Sunak said he 'shared the frustrations' of Tory MPs who have been urging him to water down human rights rules or simply ignore the Supreme Court.

The premier said he disagreed with the decision, but 'respected' it.

He said once Parliament approved a new Treaty that will guarantee people sent to Rwanda are not returned to danger in their country of origin that must be the end of the matter. He warned that Brits' 'patience has worn thin' with the failure to tackle the Channel boat situation.

The comments were immediately dismissed by Suella Braverman's allies as just another version of the previous strategy.

It came after the Supreme Court concluded unanimously that the scheme to deport arrivals immediately would break the law. It is a crushing blow to the government, which has already handed Rwanda £140million.

The decision - which ministers had feared for weeks was coming - immediately sparked Tory demands to loosen protections under the ECHR so the policy can go ahead.

However, critics pointed out the judgment suggested it would have been struck out on other grounds anyway. The case hinged on whether asylum seekers sent to Rwanda would be at 'real risk' of being returned to their country of origin and subject to mistreatment.

Tory Party deputy chairman Lee Anderson said the Government should simply 'ignore the laws' and 'just put the planes in the air now and send them to Rwanda'.

Boris Johnson urged Mr Sunak to get Parliament to designate Rwanda a 'safe' country.

He highlighted a Daily Mail column in which he argued that the Asylum and Immigration Act 2004 include powers to make the change.

Sacked Home Secretary Suella Braverman has warned he has no credible back-up to 'stop the boats'

Supreme Court president Lord Reed passing his judgment on the Rwanda deal today

At a stormy PMQs session earlier, Mr Sunak tried to put a brave face on the Supreme Court's ruling, stressing that the principle of deporting asylum seekers to a safe third country had been upheld.

He said he was ready to do 'whatever it takes' to tackle the Channel boats crisis. That included drawing up a new treaty with Rwanda, and revisiting the domestic legal framework.

Pressed repeatedly by Conservative MPs he added that 'international conventions' could also be redrawn once tweaks had been tried - but refused to give any timetable.

Home Secretary James Cleverly later risked further enraging right-wingers by insisting is it 'not necessary' to ditch the European Convention on Human Rights or UN Refugee Convention in order to 'take back control of our borders'.

And his sacked predecessor Suella Braverman waded in to call for the government to introduce 'emergency legislation' making clear international rules do not apply.

But he told the House: 'If it becomes clear that our domestic legal frameworks or international conventions are still frustrating the plans at that point, I am prepared to change our laws and revisit those international relationships,' he told MPs.

'The British people expect us to do whatever it takes to stop the boats and that is precisely what this Government will deliver.'

Making a statement to MPs after PMQs, Mr Cleverly said the ruling was a 'temporary setback' and the upgraded treaty with Rwanda - which could come before Parliament in days - would toughen rules against repatriating asylum seekers.

During bruising clashes shadow home secretary Yvette Cooper swiped that ministers knew the policy was 'batsh**'.

Mr Cleverly's predecessor Suella Braverman has already launched an excoriating attack on Mr Sunak's failure to do what it takes to tackle the Channel crisis, warning he has no 'credible Plan B'.

Even if the government is able to tweak the plan to the satisfaction of the courts MPs fear it could not happen in time to take effect before the election next year.

Justices at the UK's highest court upheld an earlier High Court judgment on legislation announced 18 months ago to send asylum seekers who arrive in the UK by unauthorised means to Kigali to have their claims heard there.

In a summary of today's momentous ruling, President of the Supreme Court Lord Reed said there would be a risk of genuine asylum seekers being returned by Rwanda to the home country they fled from.

Ministers have vowed to press on with the scheme regardless of the result today, with options including elevating the Rwanda deal to a treaty ratified in parliament - making it harder for the courts to block - and passing emergency legislation to disapply human rights laws.

Making a statement to the Commons, Mr Cleverly said: 'Nothing in the Supreme Court judgment today dims our commitment.

'The Supreme Court has said there are issues with Rwanda's asylum system which could create the possibility of someone being returned to a country where they could face persecution.'

Mr Cleverly added the UK Government has a plan to address the concerns raised, noting: 'We anticipated this judgment as a possible result and for the last few months have been working on a plan to provide the certainty that the court demands.

'We have been working with Rwanda to build capacity and amend agreements with Rwanda to make clear that those sent there cannot be sent to another country than the UK.

'Our intention is to upgrade our agreement to a treaty as soon as possible. That will make it absolutely clear to our courts and to Strasbourg that the risks laid out by the court today have been responded to, will be consistent with international law and ensure that Parliament is able to scrutinise it.'

Ex-minister Jonathan Gullis challenged Mr Cleverly on whether he was 'willing to disapply international treaties and conventions such as the ECHR and the Refugee Convention in order to take back control of our borders, yes or no?'

Mr Cleverly responded: 'I don't believe those things are necessary.'

Tory MP Caroline Johnson said her constituents were disappointed by the court's ruling, adding: 'I understand his plan is to upgrade the treaty with Rwanda, can he advise the House how long will that take? Will that be potentially subject to legal challenge? And if so, how long could those legal challenges take?'

Mr Cleverly said he was not able to give certainty on timelines, and added: 'I wish that I could.'

Tory MP David Jones said: 'He's told the House that his department had anticipated the decision of the Supreme Court that was announced today, that being the case can he tell the House if he's made an assessment as to whether legislation will be necessary in order to remedy the problems that have been identified? And if so, when would he anticipate being in a position to introduce that legislation?'

In response, the Home Secretary said: 'We have already set in place the work to turn the MoU (memorandum of understanding) into a treaty, thus by addressing some of the concerns of their Lordships.

'The Prime Minister and I have made it clear if there needs to be legislative work domestically in order to ensure we do this, we are unafraid of bringing that forward.'

Ex-PM Theresa May pointed out that the 'fundamental judgment' made by the Supreme Court on the Rwanda policy was made 'regardless of the ECHR'.

Downing Street said a new treaty with Rwanda would be laid in Parliament in the 'coming days' that the UK Government believes 'addresses concerns raised by the court'.

However, it could take more than 40 sitting days to be approved, meaning that would happen well into next year at best.

The Prime Minister's official spokesman said: 'We will lay the treaty in Parliament in the coming days so that flights can commence as soon as possible.

'Obviously the text will be set out when it is published. I'm not going to pre-empt the text itself.

'But we believe it will provide the reassurances that the court has asked for.'

The No 10 official added: 'The court set out a number of issues around refoulement.

'We plan to lay a treaty which seeks to address the concerns raised by the court. At the same time, as the Prime Minister set out, if necessary we are prepared to revisit our domestic legal frameworks and international conventions as necessary.'

Mr Sunak spoke to Rwandan President Paul Kagame this morning following the judgment.

The PM 'expressed his disappointment at the overall outcome and recognised that there are challenges we must overcome', according to a No10 readout.

'He thanked President Kagame for his Government's work over the last 15 months and the extra assurances we have already agreed as they said they would continue to work together to address the Court's concerns,' the readout said.

'Both leaders reiterated their firm commitment to making our migration partnership work and agreed to take the necessary steps to ensure this is a robust and lawful policy and to stop the boats as soon as possible.'

Outside the Commons, former Cabinet minister Sir Simon Clarke told Sky News that the UK should now consider leaving the ECHR.

'Today is a really serious challenge to who governs Britain and whether Parliament can deliver, when we say we want to address what is clearly, by anyone's standards, an unsustainable level of illegal immigration,' he said.

'For my part I think the gauntlet has now been thrown down and we are going to have to pass emergency legislation - at a minimum - to set out that the will of parliament will apply, notwithstanding the ECHR and the associated conventions that the justices referenced. But we may also have to consider, if that is not legally viable, withdrawal from the ECHR.'

He added: 'This is about whether Britain as a nation state can control who comes to this country and on what terms. It is a fundamental element of whether we are in practice able to govern Britain properly. And if our human rights framework makes that impossible then I am afraid it is the human rights framework that is going to have to change, rather than the policy.'

The New Conservatives group of Tory MPs said ministers must introduce legislation 'immediately' to override the ECHR.

Speaking after a meeting of the group with other Conservatives who share the same view, co-chair Danny Kruger said the Supreme Court judgment felt 'absolutely existential' for the party.

Options being suggested by the New Conservatives are a 'notwithstanding clause' to disapply the ECHR or initiating complete withdrawal from the ECHR.

He said the scope of the ruling meant that the UK's involvement in other treaties and conventions also needs to be considered.

'The Government should immediately announce an intention to do what is necessary to insist on our sovereignty. That means legislation to over-ride the effect of the European court, of the ECHR itself and of other conventions including the Refugee Convention if necessary.'

He added: 'This feels absolutely existential for our party ... if this Government will not step up to do whatever it takes to do what the Prime Minister has promised he will, there is no reason for the public to trust us again.'

Dover's Tory MP Natalie Elphicke has said a deal with France is now the best way to stop small boats crossing the English Channel.

She said the Supreme Court's ruling on Rwanda 'means the policy is effectively at an end'.

'No planes will be leaving and we now need to move forward,' she said.

'With winter coming, the timing of this decision couldn't be worse. Be in no doubt, this will embolden the people smugglers and put more lives at risk.

'A fresh policy is now needed: a new cross-channel agreement with France to stop the boats leaving and return those that do to the safety of the French coast. That should be David Cameron's top foreign policy priority.'

Mr Anderson described the Supreme Court judgment as a 'dark day for the British people' and said ministers should 'just put the planes in the air now and send them to Rwanda'.

'I think the British people have been very patient, I've been very patient, and now they're demanding action. And this has sort of forced our hand a little bit now,' he said.

'My take is we should just put the planes in the air now and send them to Rwanda and show strength.

'It's time for the Government to show real leadership and send them back, same day.'

He added: 'I think we should ignore the laws and send them straight back the same day.'

Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby said he hoped the Supreme Court ruling would cause the Government to 'reflect and reconsider its approach'.

Mr Welby said the Church of England had 'been clear in our profound concerns - moral and practical - about outsourcing our obligations to refugees to Rwanda'.

He added: 'We have been clear that the inefficiencies of our asylum system and its failure to treat all people with compassion and dignity must be addressed. Today's decision by the Supreme Court leaves our response to desperate people fleeing conflict and persecution in a state of limbo. I hope this judgment will give the Government the opportunity to reflect and reconsider its approach.'

Unveiling the judgment, Lord Reed said the 'legal test' in the case was whether there were 'substantial grounds' for believing that asylum seekers sent to Rwanda would be at 'real risk' of being sent back to the countries they came from where they could face 'ill treatment'.

He said: 'In the light of the evidence which I have summarised, the Court of Appeal concluded that there were such grounds.

'We are unanimously of the view that they were entitled to reach that conclusion. Indeed, having been taken through the evidence ourselves, we agree with their conclusion.'

Reacting to the news, Mr Sunak said today: 'We have seen today's judgment and will now consider next steps.

'This was not the outcome we wanted, but we have spent the last few months planning for all eventualities and we remain completely committed to stopping the boats.

'Crucially, the Supreme Court - like the Court of Appeal and the High Court before it - has confirmed that the principle of sending illegal migrants to a safe third country for processing is lawful. This confirms the Government's clear view from the outset.

'Illegal migration destroys lives and costs British taxpayers millions of pounds a year. We need to end it and we will do whatever it takes to do so.

'Because when people know that if they come here illegally, they won't get to stay then they will stop coming altogether, and we will stop the boats.'

In their ruling, which the other justices agreed with, Lords Reed and Lloyd-Jones said Rwanda's history 'cannot be effectively ignored or sidelined' as the Home Office suggested.

The justices said there was 'no dispute' that the Rwandan government entered into its deal with the UK in good faith, with strong incentives to follow the terms of the arrangement.

They continued: 'Nevertheless, intentions and aspirations do not necessarily correspond to reality: the question is whether they are achievable in practice.

'The central issue in the present case is therefore not the good faith of the government of Rwanda at the political level, but its practical ability to fulfil its assurances, at least in the short term, in the light of the present deficiencies of the Rwandan asylum system.

'In agreement with the Court of Appeal, we consider that the past and the present cannot be effectively ignored or sidelined as the Secretary of State suggests.'

In a 56-page judgment dismissing the Home Office's appeal, Lords Reed and Lloyd-Jones said the High Court had wrongly dismissed the evidence of the UN Refugee Agency, the UNHCR, about problems with the Rwandan asylum system.

They said: 'UNHCR's evidence will naturally be of greatest weight when it relates to matters within its particular remit or where it has special expertise in the subject matter.

'Its evidence in the present case concerns matters falling within its remit and about which it has undoubted expertise.'

The Supreme Court justices said there was 'evidence of a culture within Rwanda of, at best, inadequate understanding of Rwanda's obligations under the Refugee Convention'.

Lord Reed added that changes needed in Rwanda's asylum system to 'eliminate the risk' of refugees being returned to their countries of origin where they could face bad treatment 'have not been shown to be in place now'.

Protesters outside the Supreme Court today chanted 'hands off refugees' and 'Rishi Sunak, shame on you'

The Supreme Court today delivered a blow to Rishi Sunak by ruling against his Rwanda policy

He said there was a legal rule that 'refugees must not be returned to their countries of origin, either directly or indirectly, if their life or freedom would be threatened in that country'.

'That rule is called the principle of non-refoulement,' he said.

The president of the UK's highest court added: 'We accept the Home Secretary's submission that the Rwandan government entered into the agreement in good faith and that the capacity of the Rwandan system to produce accurate and fair decisions can and will be built up.

What is the European Convention on Human Rights?

After the darkest days of the Second World War, political leaders including Winston Churchill advocated for a Council of Europe (CoE) to oversee a charter of human rights.

This led to the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) being signed in 1950. Its drafting was led by Conservative MP Sir David Maxwell-Fyfe and the UK was among the first to ratify the international treaty.

Today the legal commitment signs up all 46 CoE members to abide by rules on rights to life, liberty and expression, and protection from torture, degrading treatment and slavery.

It is not linked to the European Union, so Brexit did not affect the UK's obligations.

The European Court of Human Rights, in Strasbourg, makes binding judgments on the Convention.

'Nevertheless, asking ourselves whether there were substantial grounds for believing that a real risk of refoulement existed at the relevant time, we have concluded that there were.

'The changes needed to eliminate the risk of refoulement may be delivered in the future, but they have not been shown to be in place now.'

Lord Reed said in his summary that the European Convention on Human Rights was not the only international treaty that was relevant to the Rwanda case.

He added: 'There are other international treaties which also prohibit the return of asylum seekers to their countries of origin without a proper examination of their claims.'

These included the the United Nations (UN) Refugee Convention, the UN Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment and the UN International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, he said.

Following this morning's ruling, the Liberal Democrats urged the government abandon the 'immoral, unworkable and incredibly costly' Rwanda scheme and 'get on with fixing the broken asylum system'.

Major of London Sadiq Khan said: 'The Government's Rwanda policy isn't just cruel, callous and morally reprehensible, the Supreme Court has today confirmed its unlawful too.'

Scotland's First Minister Humza Yousaf said the Rwanda scheme was 'morally repugnant' and 'should be scrapped'.

Human rights groups including Amnesty International and The Refugee Council hailed the Supreme Court's decision.

Sonya Sceats, chief executive at charity Freedom from Torture said: 'This is a victory for reason and compassion. 'We are delighted that the Supreme Court has affirmed what caring people already knew: the UK Government's 'cash for humans' deal with Rwanda is not only deeply immoral, but it also flies in the face of the laws of this country.'

Steve Smith, CEO of refugee charity Care4Calais, said: 'The Supreme Court's judgment is a victory for humanity. This grubby, cash-for-people deal was always cruel and immoral, but, most importantly, it is unlawful.'

He added: 'Today's judgment should bring this shameful mark on the UK's history to a close.

'Never again should our Government seek to shirk our country's responsibility to offer sanctuary to those caught up in horrors around the world.

'All the architects of the Rwanda plan may be gone but unless the Government changes course and introduces a policy of safe passage, then the rest should follow them out the door. There can be no more time wasted attacking the vulnerable when all they seek is our help.'

Mrs Braverman tours a building site on the outskirts of Kigali during her visit to Rwanda in March

In an excoriating letter to the Prime Minister yesterday, Mrs Braverman warned he has no 'credible Plan B' if an earlier High Court ruling that the policy is unlawful is upheld.

Asylum backlog falls by half - but 16,630 applications would need to be cleared each MONTH to meet ministers' deadline

The 'legacy' backlog of UK asylum applications stood at 33,253 as of October 29, down nearly a half (47%) from 62,157 on July 30, according to new figures from the Home Office.

Asylum applications made before June 28 2022 are counted as legacy cases. The Government has pledged to clear the legacy backlog by the end of this year. To do so, around 16,630 applications would need to be cleared per month before December 31.

Some 12,620 were cleared between September 24 and October 29, and 9,604 cleared between August 27 and September 24, figures show.

The non-legacy backlog of UK asylum cases - covering applications made on or after June 28 2022 - stood at 89,332 on October 29, up 20% from 74,622 on July 30.

The overall backlog of applications awaiting a decision, including both legacy and non-legacy cases, is 122,585: down 10% from 136,779 on July 30 and down 12% from a record 138,782 at the end of February. One asylum application does not always equal one individual, as an application can cover a group of people.

As of November 12, 27,284 people had crossed the Channel.

Meanwhile, the 'legacy' backlog of UK asylum applications stood at 33,253 as of October 29, down nearly a half (47%) from 62,157 on July 30, according to new figures from the Home Office.

Mrs Braverman's replacement, James Cleverly, outlined the possible outcomes during the first meeting of the Prime Minister's new-look Cabinet after the dramatic reshuffle that saw Mrs Braverman shown the door.

Senior ministers had wargamed responses to a defeat, but Mrs Braverman warned of a 'betrayal' of Mr Sunak's promise to do 'whatever it takes' to stop the crossings regardless.

The sacked Home Secretary wrote in the letter that if they lose he will have 'wasted a year' on the Illegal Migration Act 'only to arrive back at square one'.

'Worse than this, your magical thinking - believing that you can will your way through this without upsetting polite opinion - has meant you have failed to prepare any sort of credible 'Plan B',' she said.

Downing Street has vowed to continue to work to tackle small boat crossings 'whatever the outcome' in the Supreme Court.

'The Prime Minister believes in actions, not words,' a No 10 spokeswoman said in response to Mrs Braverman's declaration of political war.

Leaving the European Convention on Human Rights was not discussed at yesterday's Cabinet meeting, the Prime Minister's official spokesman said.

Contingency plans have been 'discussed among Cabinet ministers', the spokesman said, and 'options for possible scenarios' have been prepared.

Last month, the Home Office challenged a Court of Appeal ruling from June that overturned the High Court's finding that Rwanda could be considered a 'safe third country' for migrants.

The strategy is aimed at deterring migrants from crossing the English Channel on small boats

Lawyers representing people facing deportation to the east African nation argued Rwanda is an 'authoritarian, one-party state' with a 'woefully deficient' asylum system.

But the Home Office has said the policy to remove asylum seekers to a 'country less attractive' than the UK, 'but nevertheless safe', is lawful.

The Illegal Migration Act brought into law the Government's policy of sending some asylum seekers to Rwanda.

However, the plans announced in April 2022 have been held up in the courts, with no deportation flights having taken place despite £140 million already being handed to Kigali.

Whereas Mrs Braverman repeatedly signalled she wanted out of the 'politicised court', Mr Cleverly said while foreign secretary in April he was 'not convinced' the move is necessary.

He said that the European countries that are not signatories - Russia and Belarus - are a 'small club', adding: 'I am not convinced it is a club we want to be part of.'

Mr Sunak has set stopping small boats of asylum seekers from arriving in Britain as one of his five pledges to the electorate.

But more than 27,300 migrants have been detected making unauthorised crossings of the English Channel so far this year, according to official figures.

The Right of the Tory party has insisted Britain must leave the European human rights treaty regardless of today's outcome.

UK human rights laws need a major overhaul 'whatever the outcome' of the Government's last-ditch legal appeal, the New Conservative group of backbenchers said.

Co-chairmen of the New Conservatives Miriam Cates and Danny Kruger said in a statement they remained committed to seeing Britain leave the European Convention on Human Rights.

'We will continue to campaign for a new framework for asylum policy that fulfils our moral obligations to genuine refugees while restoring control of our borders,' they said.

'Whatever the outcome of tomorrow's judgment on the Rwanda policy, we remain of the view that the UK should reform our domestic human rights and equalities laws and leave the ECHR.'

Who are the five Supreme Court judges who ruled against the Rwanda scheme?

Five Supreme Court justices decided the future of the Government's Rwanda deportation policy -

Lord Reed - President of the Supreme Court

Lord Reed, 67, (below) has led the 12-justice court since January 2020.

Over the course of more than a decade at the UK's top court, Lord Reed has been involved in some of its biggest cases, including the challenges over the prorogation of Parliament in 2019 and holding a Scottish independence referendum last year.

He previously served as a judge in Scotland and is also a member of a panel of ad hoc judges of the European Court of Human Rights.

In March last year, Lord Reed and deputy Supreme Court president Lord Hodge quit as non-permanent judges at Hong Kong' Court of Final Appeal amid concerns about the erosion of human rights.

Lord Reed was educated at the universities of Edinburgh and Oxford before qualifying as an advocate in Scotland and a barrister in England and Wales.

He has previously challenged claims that judges were meddling in political decision-making in the wake of the Supreme Court's ruling that former prime minister Boris Johnson's decision to suspend Parliament in 2019 was unlawful.

He told the BBC in October 2020: 'We don't do politics, we do decide legal questions which can have political ramifications and they can be important political consequences, but the issue we decide is strictly legal issue.'

Lord Hodge - Deputy President of the Supreme Court

Lord Hodge, 70, (below) was appointed deputy president of the UK's top court in January 2020.

The Scot, who succeeded compatriot Lord Reed when he became president, has served on the court since October 2013.

The judge was admitted to the Faculty of Advocates in 1983 and appointed a Queen's Counsel in 1996.

He has held a number of roles in Scotland, including the Scottish Judge in Exchequer Causes.

Lord Lloyd-Jones

Lord Lloyd-Jones, 71, (right) is on his second stint as a Supreme Court justice having originally served between October 2017 and January 2022.

After retiring from the role, he returned in August 2022 after an increase in the mandatory retirement age for judges from 70 to 75.

He was born and brought up in Pontypridd, South Wales, where his father was a school teacher, and was the court's first justice to come from Wales.

A Welsh speaker, he was appointed to the High Court in 2005, and acted as adviser to the court in the Pinochet litigation before the House of Lords.

He has also served as a Lord Justice of Appeal and as chairman of the Law Commission.

Lord Briggs

The Supreme Court's most senior English member, Lord Briggs, 68, (below) became a justice in October 2017.

He grew up around Portsmouth and Plymouth, following his naval officer father between ships, before spending his later childhood in West Sussex.

A keen sailor and the first lawyer in his family, he worked as a commercial lawyer before joining the High Court in 2006 where he oversaw the insolvency litigation following the collapse of the Lehman Brothers group from 2009 to 2013.

He joined the Court of Appeal in 2013 and was involved in civil justice reform, leading the Chancery Modernisation Review and Civil Courts Structure Review.

Lord Sales

Lord Sales, 61, (right) was the youngest of the court's justices when he was appointed in January 2019.

He worked as a barrister and QC before his appointment to the High Court in 2008.

He was educated at the Royal Grammar School in Guildford, before studying law at both Cambridge and Oxford universities.

He was vice-president of the Investigatory Powers Tribunal, served as deputy chairman of the Boundary Commission for England and was appointed as a Lord Justice of Appeal.

Advertisement Timeline: How did the Rwanda scheme end up before the Supreme Court?

The Supreme Court judgment on the Government's plans to removal asylum seekers to Rwanda comes more than 18 months after they were first announced.

Boris Johnson today urged Rishi Sunak to change the law to deem Rwanda a 'safe' country in the wake of the Supreme Court's block on migrants being flown there.

The former prime minister claimed it was the 'only way' to end a 'legal blockade' on the Government's asylum deal with the east African nation.

Mr Johnson, who first proposed the Rwanda plan in April 2022 when he was in No10, offered his view after the UK's top court this morning ruled the arrangement was unlawful.

Posting on X, formerly known as Twitter, the ex-premier urged Mr Sunak to follow the advice he set out in a Daily Mail column he wrote in June.

'There is only one way to end the legal blockade on Rwanda - and that is to do exactly what this piece proposes - and do it NOW,' Mr Johnson wrote, as he shared a link to his past article.

'If you want to know what the government of 2019-2022 would have done, here is your answer. It's the only way.'

Mr Johnson had used the article to respond to an initial Court of Appeal ruling that the Rwanda plan was unlawful due to a risk refugees could be returned to their home countries.

He wrote in his Daily Mail column in June: 'As the judgment points out, the Government has the power, under Schedule 3 of the Asylum and Immigration Act 2004, to ask ­Parliament to deem Rwanda a safe country.

'That has not so far been done and it should now be done -- immediately. Yes, of course there would be a row.

'The House of Lords might well be difficult -- but we have been here before. It is time for the Government to settle the legal position.

'It is time -- with a large remaining majority -- for Parliament to determine that Rwanda is safe, bust the evil people traffickers, stop the boats, recapture the spirit of 2019 and get Rwanda done.'

Mr Johnson's intervention came after Mr Sunak insisted he could water down the UK's international human rights commitments after the Supreme Court ruling.

At a stormy PMQs session, Mr Sunak tried to put a brave face on the judgment and stressed that the principle of deporting asylum seekers to a safe third country had been upheld.

The PM said he was ready to do 'whatever it takes' to tackle the Channel boats crisis.

That included drawing up a new treaty with Rwanda, and revisiting the domestic legal framework.

But pressed repeatedly by Conservative MPs he added that 'international conventions' could also be redrawn if necessary once tweaks had been tried.

'If it becomes clear that our domestic legal frameworks or international conventions are still frustrating the plans at that point, I am prepared to change our laws and revisit those international relationships,' he told MPs.

'The British people expect us to do whatever it takes to stop the boats and that is precisely what this Government will deliver.'

The comments came after the Supreme Court concluded unanimously that the scheme to deport arrivals immediately would break the law.

It is a crushing blow to the Government, which has already handed Rwanda £140million.

The decision - which ministers had feared for weeks was coming - immediately sparked Tory demands to loosen protections under the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) so the policy can go ahead.

However, critics pointed out the judgment suggested it would have been struck out on other grounds anyway. The case hinged on whether asylum seekers sent to Rwanda would be at 'real risk' of being returned to their country of origin and subject to mistreatment.

Tory Party deputy chairman Lee Anderson said the Government should simply 'ignore the laws' and 'just put the planes in the air now and send them to Rwanda'.

Mr Sunak will flesh out his 'next steps' in a Downing Street press conference at 4.45pm.

Making a statement to MPs after PMQs, Home Secretary James Cleverly said the ruling was a 'temporary setback' and the upgraded treaty with Rwanda - which could come before Parliament in days - would toughen rules against repatriating asylum seekers.

During bruising clashes shadow home secretary Yvette Cooper swiped that ministers knew the policy was 'batsh**'.

But Mr Cleverly's predecessor Suella Braverman has already launched an excoriating attack on Mr Sunak's failure to do what it takes to tackle the Channel crisis, warning he has no 'credible Plan B'.

Even if the Government is able to tweak the plan to the satisfaction of the courts MPs fear it could not happen in time to take effect before the election next year.

Justices at the UK's highest court upheld an earlier High Court judgment on legislation announced 18 months ago to send asylum seekers who arrive in the UK by unauthorised means to Kigali to have their claims heard there.

In a summary of today's momentous ruling, President of the Supreme Court Lord Reed said there would be a risk of genuine asylum seekers being returned by Rwanda to the home country they fled from.

Ministers have vowed to press on with the scheme regardless of the result today, with options including elevating the Rwanda deal to a treaty ratified in parliament - making it harder for the courts to block - and passing emergency legislation to disapply human rights laws.

Making a statement to the Commons, Mr Cleverly said: 'Nothing in the Supreme Court judgment today dims our commitment.

'The Supreme Court has said there are issues with Rwanda's asylum system which could create the possibility of someone being returned to a country where they could face persecution.'

Mr Cleverly added the UK Government has a plan to address the concerns raised, noting: 'We anticipated this judgment as a possible result and for the last few months have been working on a plan to provide the certainty that the court demands.

'We have been working with Rwanda to build capacity and amend agreements with Rwanda to make clear that those sent there cannot be sent to another country than the UK.

'Our intention is to upgrade our agreement to a treaty as soon as possible. That will make it absolutely clear to our courts and to Strasbourg that the risks laid out by the court today have been responded to, will be consistent with international law and ensure that Parliament is able to scrutinise it.'

Downing Street said a new treaty with Rwanda would be laid in Parliament in the 'coming days' that the UK Government believes 'addresses concerns raised by the court'.

However, it could take more than 40 sitting days to be approved, meaning that would happen well into next year at best.

The Prime Minister's official spokesman said: 'We will lay the treaty in Parliament in the coming days so that flights can commence as soon as possible.

'Obviously the text will be set out when it is published. I'm not going to pre-empt the text itself.

'But we believe it will provide the reassurances that the court has asked for.'

The No 10 official added: 'The court set out a number of issues around refoulement.

'We plan to lay a treaty which seeks to address the concerns raised by the court. At the same time, as the Prime Minister set out, if necessary we are prepared to revisit our domestic legal frameworks and international conventions as necessary.'

Mr Sunak spoke to Rwandan President Paul Kagame this morning following the judgment.

The PM 'expressed his disappointment at the overall outcome and recognised that there are challenges we must overcome', according to a No10 readout.

'He thanked President Kagame for his Government's work over the last 15 months and the extra assurances we have already agreed as they said they would continue to work together to address the Court's concerns,' the readout said.

'Both leaders reiterated their firm commitment to making our migration partnership work and agreed to take the necessary steps to ensure this is a robust and lawful policy and to stop the boats as soon as possible.'

Outside the Commons, former Cabinet minister Sir Simon Clarke told Sky News that the UK should now consider leaving the ECHR.

'Today is a really serious challenge to who governs Britain and whether Parliament can deliver, when we say we want to address what is clearly, by anyone's standards, an unsustainable level of illegal immigration,' he said.

'For my part I think the gauntlet has now been thrown down and we are going to have to pass emergency legislation - at a minimum - to set out that the will of parliament will apply, notwithstanding the ECHR and the associated conventions that the justices referenced. But we may also have to consider, if that is not legally viable, withdrawal from the ECHR.'

He added: 'This is about whether Britain as a nation state can control who comes to this country and on what terms. It is a fundamental element of whether we are in practice able to govern Britain properly. And if our human rights framework makes that impossible then I am afraid it is the human rights framework that is going to have to change, rather than the policy.'

The New Conservatives group of Tory MPs said ministers must introduce legislation 'immediately' to override the ECHR.

Speaking after a meeting of the group with other Conservatives who share the same view, co-chair Danny Kruger said the Supreme Court judgment felt 'absolutely existential' for the party.

Options being suggested by the New Conservatives are a 'notwithstanding clause' to disapply the ECHR or initiating complete withdrawal from the ECHR.

He said the scope of the ruling meant that the UK's involvement in other treaties and conventions also needs to be considered.

'The Government should immediately announce an intention to do what is necessary to insist on our sovereignty. That means legislation to over-ride the effect of the European court, of the ECHR itself and of other conventions including the Refugee Convention if necessary.'

He added: 'This feels absolutely existential for our party ... if this Government will not step up to do whatever it takes to do what the Prime Minister has promised he will, there is no reason for the public to trust us again.'

Dover's Tory MP Natalie Elphicke has said a deal with France is now the best way to stop small boats crossing the English Channel.

She said the Supreme Court's ruling on Rwanda 'means the policy is effectively at an end'.

'No planes will be leaving and we now need to move forward,' she said.

'With winter coming, the timing of this decision couldn't be worse. Be in no doubt, this will embolden the people smugglers and put more lives at risk.

'A fresh policy is now needed: a new cross-channel agreement with France to stop the boats leaving and return those that do to the safety of the French coast. That should be David Cameron's top foreign policy priority.'

Mr Anderson described the Supreme Court judgment as a 'dark day for the British people' and said ministers should 'just put the planes in the air now and send them to Rwanda'.

'I think the British people have been very patient, I've been very patient, and now they're demanding action. And this has sort of forced our hand a little bit now,' he said.

'My take is we should just put the planes in the air now and send them to Rwanda and show strength.

'It's time for the Government to show real leadership and send them back, same day.'

He added: 'I think we should ignore the laws and send them straight back the same day.'

Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby said he hoped the Supreme Court ruling would cause the Government to 'reflect and reconsider its approach'.

Mr Welby said the Church of England had 'been clear in our profound concerns - moral and practical - about outsourcing our obligations to refugees to Rwanda'.

He added: 'We have been clear that the inefficiencies of our asylum system and its failure to treat all people with compassion and dignity must be addressed. Today's decision by the Supreme Court leaves our response to desperate people fleeing conflict and persecution in a state of limbo. I hope this judgment will give the Government the opportunity to reflect and reconsider its approach.'

Unveiling the judgment, Lord Reed said the 'legal test' in the case was whether there were 'substantial grounds' for believing that asylum seekers sent to Rwanda would be at 'real risk' of being sent back to the countries they came from where they could face 'ill treatment'.

He said: 'In the light of the evidence which I have summarised, the Court of Appeal concluded that there were such grounds.

'We are unanimously of the view that they were entitled to reach that conclusion. Indeed, having been taken through the evidence ourselves, we agree with their conclusion.'

Reacting to the news, Mr Sunak said today: 'We have seen today's judgment and will now consider next steps.

'This was not the outcome we wanted, but we have spent the last few months planning for all eventualities and we remain completely committed to stopping the boats.

'Crucially, the Supreme Court - like the Court of Appeal and the High Court before it - has confirmed that the principle of sending illegal migrants to a safe third country for processing is lawful. This confirms the Government's clear view from the outset.

'Illegal migration destroys lives and costs British taxpayers millions of pounds a year. We need to end it and we will do whatever it takes to do so.

'Because when people know that if they come here illegally, they won't get to stay then they will stop coming altogether, and we will stop the boats.'

In their ruling, which the other justices agreed with, Lords Reed and Lloyd-Jones said Rwanda's history 'cannot be effectively ignored or sidelined' as the Home Office suggested.

The justices said there was 'no dispute' that the Rwandan government entered into its deal with the UK in good faith, with strong incentives to follow the terms of the arrangement.

They continued: 'Nevertheless, intentions and aspirations do not necessarily correspond to reality: the question is whether they are achievable in practice.

'The central issue in the present case is therefore not the good faith of the government of Rwanda at the political level, but its practical ability to fulfil its assurances, at least in the short term, in the light of the present deficiencies of the Rwandan asylum system.

'In agreement with the Court of Appeal, we consider that the past and the present cannot be effectively ignored or sidelined as the Secretary of State suggests.'

In a 56-page judgment dismissing the Home Office's appeal, Lords Reed and Lloyd-Jones said the High Court had wrongly dismissed the evidence of the UN Refugee Agency, the UNHCR, about problems with the Rwandan asylum system.

They said: 'UNHCR's evidence will naturally be of greatest weight when it relates to matters within its particular remit or where it has special expertise in the subject matter.

'Its evidence in the present case concerns matters falling within its remit and about which it has undoubted expertise.'

The Supreme Court justices said there was 'evidence of a culture within Rwanda of, at best, inadequate understanding of Rwanda's obligations under the Refugee Convention'.

Lord Reed added that changes needed in Rwanda's asylum system to 'eliminate the risk' of refugees being returned to their countries of origin where they could face bad treatment 'have not been shown to be in place now'.

Protesters outside the Supreme Court today chanted 'hands off refugees' and 'Rishi Sunak, shame on you'

He said there was a legal rule that 'refugees must not be returned to their countries of origin, either directly or indirectly, if their life or freedom would be threatened in that country'.

'That rule is called the principle of non-refoulement,' he said.

The president of the UK's highest court added: 'We accept the Home Secretary's submission that the Rwandan government entered into the agreement in good faith and that the capacity of the Rwandan system to produce accurate and fair decisions can and will be built up.

What is the European Convention on Human Rights?

After the darkest days of the Second World War, political leaders including Winston Churchill advocated for a Council of Europe (CoE) to oversee a charter of human rights.

This led to the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) being signed in 1950. Its drafting was led by Conservative MP Sir David Maxwell-Fyfe and the UK was among the first to ratify the international treaty.

Today the legal commitment signs up all 46 CoE members to abide by rules on rights to life, liberty and expression, and protection from torture, degrading treatment and slavery.

It is not linked to the European Union, so Brexit did not affect the UK's obligations.

'Nevertheless, asking ourselves whether there were substantial grounds for believing that a real risk of refoulement existed at the relevant time, we have concluded that there were.

'The changes needed to eliminate the risk of refoulement may be delivered in the future, but they have not been shown to be in place now.'

Lord Reed said in his summary that the European Convention on Human Rights was not the only international treaty that was relevant to the Rwanda case.

He added: 'There are other international treaties which also prohibit the return of asylum seekers to their countries of origin without a proper examination of their claims.'

These included the the United Nations (UN) Refugee Convention, the UN Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment and the UN International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, he said.

Following this morning's ruling, the Liberal Democrats urged the government abandon the 'immoral, unworkable and incredibly costly' Rwanda scheme and 'get on with fixing the broken asylum system'.

Major of London Sadiq Khan said: 'The Government's Rwanda policy isn't just cruel, callous and morally reprehensible, the Supreme Court has today confirmed its unlawful too.'

Scotland's First Minister Humza Yousaf said the Rwanda scheme was 'morally repugnant' and 'should be scrapped'.

Human rights groups including Amnesty International and The Refugee Council hailed the Supreme Court's decision.

Sonya Sceats, chief executive at charity Freedom from Torture said: 'This is a victory for reason and compassion. 'We are delighted that the Supreme Court has affirmed what caring people already knew: the UK Government's 'cash for humans' deal with Rwanda is not only deeply immoral, but it also flies in the face of the laws of this country.'

Steve Smith, CEO of refugee charity Care4Calais, said: 'The Supreme Court's judgment is a victory for humanity. This grubby, cash-for-people deal was always cruel and immoral, but, most importantly, it is unlawful.'

He added: 'Today's judgment should bring this shameful mark on the UK's history to a close.

'Never again should our Government seek to shirk our country's responsibility to offer sanctuary to those caught up in horrors around the world.

'All the architects of the Rwanda plan may be gone but unless the Government changes course and introduces a policy of safe passage, then the rest should follow them out the door. There can be no more time wasted attacking the vulnerable when all they seek is our help.'

Mrs Braverman tours a building site on the outskirts of Kigali during her visit to Rwanda in March

In an excoriating letter to the Prime Minister yesterday, Mrs Braverman warned he has no 'credible Plan B' if an earlier High Court ruling that the policy is unlawful is upheld.

Asylum backlog falls by half - but 16,630 applications would need to be cleared each MONTH to meet ministers' deadline

The 'legacy' backlog of UK asylum applications stood at 33,253 as of October 29, down nearly a half (47%) from 62,157 on July 30, according to new figures from the Home Office.

Asylum applications made before June 28 2022 are counted as legacy cases. The Government has pledged to clear the legacy backlog by the end of this year. To do so, around 16,630 applications would need to be cleared per month before December 31.

Some 12,620 were cleared between September 24 and October 29, and 9,604 cleared between August 27 and September 24, figures show.

The non-legacy backlog of UK asylum cases - covering applications made on or after June 28 2022 - stood at 89,332 on October 29, up 20% from 74,622 on July 30.

The overall backlog of applications awaiting a decision, including both legacy and non-legacy cases, is 122,585: down 10% from 136,779 on July 30 and down 12% from a record 138,782 at the end of February. One asylum application does not always equal one individual, as an application can cover a group of people.

As of November 12, 27,284 people had crossed the Channel.

Meanwhile, the 'legacy' backlog of UK asylum applications stood at 33,253 as of October 29, down nearly a half (47%) from 62,157 on July 30, according to new figures from the Home Office.

Mrs Braverman's replacement, James Cleverly, outlined the possible outcomes during the first meeting of the Prime Minister's new-look Cabinet after the dramatic reshuffle that saw Mrs Braverman shown the door.

Senior ministers had wargamed responses to a defeat, but Mrs Braverman warned of a 'betrayal' of Mr Sunak's promise to do 'whatever it takes' to stop the crossings regardless.

The sacked Home Secretary wrote in the letter that if they lose he will have 'wasted a year' on the Illegal Migration Act 'only to arrive back at square one'.

'Worse than this, your magical thinking - believing that you can will your way through this without upsetting polite opinion - has meant you have failed to prepare any sort of credible 'Plan B',' she said.

Downing Street has vowed to continue to work to tackle small boat crossings 'whatever the outcome' in the Supreme Court.

'The Prime Minister believes in actions, not words,' a No 10 spokeswoman said in response to Mrs Braverman's declaration of political war.

Leaving the European Convention on Human Rights was not discussed at yesterday's Cabinet meeting, the Prime Minister's official spokesman said.

Contingency plans have been 'discussed among Cabinet ministers', the spokesman said, and 'options for possible scenarios' have been prepared.

Last month, the Home Office challenged a Court of Appeal ruling from June that overturned the High Court's finding that Rwanda could be considered a 'safe third country' for migrants.

The strategy is aimed at deterring migrants from crossing the English Channel on small boats

Lawyers representing people facing deportation to the east African nation argued Rwanda is an 'authoritarian, one-party state' with a 'woefully deficient' asylum system.

But the Home Office has said the policy to remove asylum seekers to a 'country less attractive' than the UK, 'but nevertheless safe', is lawful.

The Illegal Migration Act brought into law the Government's policy of sending some asylum seekers to Rwanda.

However, the plans announced in April 2022 have been held up in the courts, with no deportation flights having taken place despite £140 million already being handed to Kigali.

Whereas Mrs Braverman repeatedly signalled she wanted out of the 'politicised court', Mr Cleverly said while foreign secretary in April he was 'not convinced' the move is necessary.

He said that the European countries that are not signatories - Russia and Belarus - are a 'small club', adding: 'I am not convinced it is a club we want to be part of.'

Mr Sunak has set stopping small boats of asylum seekers from arriving in Britain as one of his five pledges to the electorate.

But more than 27,300 migrants have been detected making unauthorised crossings of the English Channel so far this year, according to official figures.

The Right of the Tory party has insisted Britain must leave the European human rights treaty regardless of today's outcome.

UK human rights laws need a major overhaul 'whatever the outcome' of the Government's last-ditch legal appeal, the New Conservative group of backbenchers said.

Co-chairmen of the New Conservatives Miriam Cates and Danny Kruger said in a statement they remained committed to seeing Britain leave the European Convention on Human Rights.

'We will continue to campaign for a new framework for asylum policy that fulfils our moral obligations to genuine refugees while restoring control of our borders,' they said.

'Whatever the outcome of tomorrow's judgment on the Rwanda policy, we remain of the view that the UK should reform our domestic human rights and equalities laws and leave the ECHR.'

Who are the five Supreme Court judges who ruled against the Rwanda scheme?

Five Supreme Court justices decided the future of the Government's Rwanda deportation policy -

Lord Reed - President of the Supreme Court

Lord Reed, 67, (below) has led the 12-justice court since January 2020.

Over the course of more than a decade at the UK's top court, Lord Reed has been involved in some of its biggest cases, including the challenges over the prorogation of Parliament in 2019 and holding a Scottish independence referendum last year.

He previously served as a judge in Scotland and is also a member of a panel of ad hoc judges of the European Court of Human Rights.

In March last year, Lord Reed and deputy Supreme Court president Lord Hodge quit as non-permanent judges at Hong Kong' Court of Final Appeal amid concerns about the erosion of human rights.

Lord Reed was educated at the universities of Edinburgh and Oxford before qualifying as an advocate in Scotland and a barrister in England and Wales.

He has previously challenged claims that judges were meddling in political decision-making in the wake of the Supreme Court's ruling that former prime minister Boris Johnson's decision to suspend Parliament in 2019 was unlawful.

He told the BBC in October 2020: 'We don't do politics, we do decide legal questions which can have political ramifications and they can be important political consequences, but the issue we decide is strictly legal issue.'

Lord Hodge - Deputy President of the Supreme Court

Lord Hodge, 70, (below) was appointed deputy president of the UK's top court in January 2020.

The Scot, who succeeded compatriot Lord Reed when he became president, has served on the court since October 2013.

The judge was admitted to the Faculty of Advocates in 1983 and appointed a Queen's Counsel in 1996.

He has held a number of roles in Scotland, including the Scottish Judge in Exchequer Causes.

Lord Lloyd-Jones

Lord Lloyd-Jones, 71, (right) is on his second stint as a Supreme Court justice having originally served between October 2017 and January 2022.

The Supreme Court judgment on the Government's plans to removal asylum seekers to Rwanda comes more than 18 months after they were first announced.

Ongoing legal battles have meant there has yet to be any migrants sent to the East African nation under the policy.

Meanwhile, the Channel migrant crisis continues amid much political debate.

Here is how events leading up to today's ruling have unfolded since the Rwanda plan was unveiled:

- 2022

At a stormy PMQs session, Mr Sunak said he was ready to do 'whatever it takes' to tackle the Channel boats crisis. That included drawing up a new treaty with Rwanda, and revisiting the domestic legal framework.

But pressed by a Conservative MP he added that 'international conventions' could also be redrawn if necessary.

The comments came after the Supreme Court concluded unanimously that the scheme to deport arrivals immediately would break the law in a crushing blow to the government.

The decision - which ministers had feared for weeks was coming - immediately sparked Tory demands to loosen protections under the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) so the policy can go ahead.

However, critics pointed out the judgment suggested it would have been struck out on other grounds anyway. The case hinged on whether asylum seekers sent to Rwanda would be at 'real risk' of being returned to their country of origin and subject to mistreatment.

Tory Party deputy chairman Lee Anderson said the Government should simply 'ignore the laws' and 'just put the planes in the air now and send them to Rwanda'.

Mr Sunak tried to put a brave face on the setback, stressing that the principle of deporting asylum seekers to a safe third country had been upheld.

He will set out 'next steps' in a Downing Street press conference at 4.45pm. Before that new Home Secretary James Cleverly will make a statement to MPs.

But Mr Cleverly's predecessor Suella Braverman has already launched an excoriating attack on Mr Sunak's failure to do what it takes to tackle the Channel crisis, warning he has no 'credible Plan B'.

Even if the government is able to tweak the plan to the satisfaction of the courts MPs fear it could not happen in time to take effect before the election next year.

Justices at the UK's highest court upheld an earlier High Court judgment on legislation announced 18 months ago to send asylum seekers who arrive in the UK by unauthorised means to Kigali to have their claims heard there.

In a summary of today's momentous ruling, President of the Supreme Court Lord Reed said there would be a risk of genuine asylum seekers being returned by Rwanda to the home country they fled from.

Ministers have vowed to press on with the scheme regardless of the result today, with options including elevating the Rwanda deal to a treaty ratified in parliament - making it harder for the courts to block - and passing emergency legislation to disapply human rights laws.

Former Cabinet minister Sir Simon Clarke told Sky News that the UK should now consider leaving the ECHR.

'Today is a really serious challenge to who governs Britain and whether Parliament can deliver, when we say we want to address what is clearly, by anyone's standards, an unsustainable level of illegal immigration,' he said.

'For my part I think the gauntlet has now been thrown down and we are going to have to pass emergency legislation - at a minimum - to set out that the will of parliament will apply, notwithstanding the ECHR and the associated conventions that the justices referenced. But we may also have to consider, if that is not legally viable, withdrawal from the ECHR.'

He added: 'This is about whether Britain as a nation state can control who comes to this country and on what terms. It is a fundamental element of whether we are in practice able to govern Britain properly. And if our human rights framework makes that impossible then I am afraid it is the human rights framework that is going to have to change, rather than the policy.'

What is the European Convention on Human Rights?

After the darkest days of the Second World War, political leaders including Winston Churchill advocated for a Council of Europe (CoE) to oversee a charter of human rights.

This led to the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) being signed in 1950. Its drafting was led by Conservative MP Sir David Maxwell-Fyfe and the UK was among the first to ratify the international treaty.

Today the legal commitment signs up all 46 CoE members to abide by rules on rights to life, liberty and expression, and protection from torture, degrading treatment and slavery.

It is not linked to the European Union, so Brexit did not affect the UK's obligations.

The European Court of Human Rights, in Strasbourg, makes binding judgments on the Convention.

The New Conservatives group of Tory MPs said ministers must introduce legislation 'immediately' to override the ECHR.

Speaking after a meeting of the group with other Conservatives who share the same view, co-chair Danny Kruger said the Supreme Court judgment felt 'absolutely existential' for the party.

Options being suggested by the New Conservatives are a 'notwithstanding clause' to disapply the ECHR or initiating complete withdrawal from the ECHR.

He said the scope of the ruling meant that the UK's involvement in other treaties and conventions also needs to be considered.

'The Government should immediately announce an intention to do what is necessary to insist on our sovereignty. That means legislation to over-ride the effect of the European court, of the ECHR itself and of other conventions including the Refugee Convention if necessary.'

He added: 'This feels absolutely existential for our party ... if this Government will not step up to do whatever it takes to do what the Prime Minister has promised he will, there is no reason for the public to trust us again.'

Dover's Tory MP Natalie Elphicke has said a deal with France is now the best way to stop small boats crossing the English Channel.

She said the Supreme Court's ruling on Rwanda 'means the policy is effectively at an end'.

'No planes will be leaving and we now need to move forward,' she said.

'With winter coming, the timing of this decision couldn't be worse. Be in no doubt, this will embolden the people smugglers and put more lives at risk.

'A fresh policy is now needed: a new cross-channel agreement with France to stop the boats leaving and return those that do to the safety of the French coast. That should be David Cameron's top foreign policy priority.'

Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby said he hoped the Supreme Court ruling would cause the Government to 'reflect and reconsider its approach'.

Mr Welby said the Church of England had 'been clear in our profound concerns - moral and practical - about outsourcing our obligations to refugees to Rwanda'.

He added: 'We have been clear that the inefficiencies of our asylum system and its failure to treat all people with compassion and dignity must be addressed. Today's decision by the Supreme Court leaves our response to desperate people fleeing conflict and persecution in a state of limbo. I hope this judgment will give the Government the opportunity to reflect and reconsider its approach.'

Unveiling the judgment, Lord Reed said the 'legal test' in the case was whether there were 'substantial grounds' for believing that asylum seekers sent to Rwanda would be at 'real risk' of being sent back to the countries they came from where they could face 'ill treatment'.

He said: 'In the light of the evidence which I have summarised, the Court of Appeal concluded that there were such grounds.

'We are unanimously of the view that they were entitled to reach that conclusion. Indeed, having been taken through the evidence ourselves, we agree with their conclusion.'

Reacting to the news, Mr Sunak said today: 'We have seen today's judgment and will now consider next steps.

'This was not the outcome we wanted, but we have spent the last few months planning for all eventualities and we remain completely committed to stopping the boats.

'Crucially, the Supreme Court - like the Court of Appeal and the High Court before it - has confirmed that the principle of sending illegal migrants to a safe third country for processing is lawful. This confirms the Government's clear view from the outset.

'Illegal migration destroys lives and costs British taxpayers millions of pounds a year. We need to end it and we will do whatever it takes to do so.

'Because when people know that if they come here illegally, they won't get to stay then they will stop coming altogether, and we will stop the boats.'

In their ruling, which the other justices agreed with, Lords Reed and Lloyd-Jones said Rwanda's history 'cannot be effectively ignored or sidelined' as the Home Office suggested.

The justices said there was 'no dispute' that the Rwandan government entered into its deal with the UK in good faith, with strong incentives to follow the terms of the arrangement.

They continued: 'Nevertheless, intentions and aspirations do not necessarily correspond to reality: the question is whether they are achievable in practice.

'The central issue in the present case is therefore not the good faith of the government of Rwanda at the political level, but its practical ability to fulfil its assurances, at least in the short term, in the light of the present deficiencies of the Rwandan asylum system.

'In agreement with the Court of Appeal, we consider that the past and the present cannot be effectively ignored or sidelined as the Secretary of State suggests.'

In a 56-page judgment dismissing the Home Office's appeal, Lords Reed and Lloyd-Jones said the High Court had wrongly dismissed the evidence of the UN Refugee Agency, the UNHCR, about problems with the Rwandan asylum system.

They said: 'UNHCR's evidence will naturally be of greatest weight when it relates to matters within its particular remit or where it has special expertise in the subject matter.

'Its evidence in the present case concerns matters falling within its remit and about which it has undoubted expertise.'

The Supreme Court justices said there was 'evidence of a culture within Rwanda of, at best, inadequate understanding of Rwanda's obligations under the Refugee Convention'.

Lord Reed added that changes needed in Rwanda's asylum system to 'eliminate the risk' of refugees being returned to their countries of origin where they could face bad treatment 'have not been shown to be in place now'.

Protesters outside the Supreme Court today chanted 'hands off refugees' and 'Rishi Sunak, shame on you'

He said there was a legal rule that 'refugees must not be returned to their countries of origin, either directly or indirectly, if their life or freedom would be threatened in that country'.

'That rule is called the principle of non-refoulement,' he said.

The president of the UK's highest court added: 'We accept the Home Secretary's submission that the Rwandan government entered into the agreement in good faith and that the capacity of the Rwandan system to produce accurate and fair decisions can and will be built up.

'Nevertheless, asking ourselves whether there were substantial grounds for believing that a real risk of refoulement existed at the relevant time, we have concluded that there were.

'The changes needed to eliminate the risk of refoulement may be delivered in the future, but they have not been shown to be in place now.'

Lord Reed said in his summary that the European Convention on Human Rights was not the only international treaty that was relevant to the Rwanda case.

Asylum backlog falls by half - but 16,630 applications would need to be cleared each MONTH to meet ministers' deadline

The 'legacy' backlog of UK asylum applications stood at 33,253 as of October 29, down nearly a half (47%) from 62,157 on July 30, according to new figures from the Home Office.

Asylum applications made before June 28 2022 are counted as legacy cases. The Government has pledged to clear the legacy backlog by the end of this year. To do so, around 16,630 applications would need to be cleared per month before December 31.

Some 12,620 were cleared between September 24 and October 29, and 9,604 cleared between August 27 and September 24, figures show.

The non-legacy backlog of UK asylum cases - covering applications made on or after June 28 2022 - stood at 89,332 on October 29, up 20% from 74,622 on July 30.

The overall backlog of applications awaiting a decision, including both legacy and non-legacy cases, is 122,585: down 10% from 136,779 on July 30 and down 12% from a record 138,782 at the end of February. One asylum application does not always equal one individual, as an application can cover a group of people.

He added: 'There are other international treaties which also prohibit the return of asylum seekers to their countries of origin without a proper examination of their claims.'

These included the the United Nations (UN) Refugee Convention, the UN Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment and the UN International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, he said.

Following this morning's ruling, the Liberal Democrats urged the government abandon the 'immoral, unworkable and incredibly costly' Rwanda scheme and 'get on with fixing the broken asylum system'.

Major of London Sadiq Khan said: 'The Government's Rwanda policy isn't just cruel, callous and morally reprehensible, the Supreme Court has today confirmed its unlawful too.'

Scotland's First Minister Humza Yousaf said the Rwanda scheme was 'morally repugnant' and 'should be scrapped'.

Human rights groups including Amnesty International and The Refugee Council hailed the Supreme Court's decision.

Sonya Sceats, chief executive at charity Freedom from Torture said: 'This is a victory for reason and compassion. 'We are delighted that the Supreme Court has affirmed what caring people already knew: the UK Government's 'cash for humans' deal with Rwanda is not only deeply immoral, but it also flies in the face of the laws of this country.'

Steve Smith, CEO of refugee charity Care4Calais, said: 'The Supreme Court's judgment is a victory for humanity. This grubby, cash-for-people deal was always cruel and immoral, but, most importantly, it is unlawful.'

He added: 'Today's judgment should bring this shameful mark on the UK's history to a close.

'Never again should our Government seek to shirk our country's responsibility to offer sanctuary to those caught up in horrors around the world.

'All the architects of the Rwanda plan may be gone but unless the Government changes course and introduces a policy of safe passage, then the rest should follow them out the door. There can be no more time wasted attacking the vulnerable when all they seek is our help.'

Mrs Braverman tours a building site on the outskirts of Kigali during her visit to Rwanda in March

In an excoriating letter to the Prime Minister yesterday, Mrs Braverman warned he has no 'credible Plan B' if an earlier High Court ruling that the policy is unlawful is upheld.

As of November 12, 27,284 people had crossed the Channel.

Meanwhile, the 'legacy' backlog of UK asylum applications stood at 33,253 as of October 29, down nearly a half (47%) from 62,157 on July 30, according to new figures from the Home Office.

Mrs Braverman's replacement, James Cleverly, outlined the possible outcomes during the first meeting of the Prime Minister's new-look Cabinet after the dramatic reshuffle that saw Mrs Braverman shown the door.

Senior ministers had wargamed responses to a defeat, but Mrs Braverman warned of a 'betrayal' of Mr Sunak's promise to do 'whatever it takes' to stop the crossings regardless.

The sacked Home Secretary wrote in the letter that if they lose he will have 'wasted a year' on the Illegal Migration Act 'only to arrive back at square one'.

'Worse than this, your magical thinking - believing that you can will your way through this without upsetting polite opinion - has meant you have failed to prepare any sort of credible 'Plan B',' she said.

Downing Street has vowed to continue to work to tackle small boat crossings 'whatever the outcome' in the Supreme Court.

'The Prime Minister believes in actions, not words,' a No 10 spokeswoman said in response to Mrs Braverman's declaration of political war.

Leaving the European Convention on Human Rights was not discussed at yesterday's Cabinet meeting, the Prime Minister's official spokesman said.

Contingency plans have been 'discussed among Cabinet ministers', the spokesman said, and 'options for possible scenarios' have been prepared.

Last month, the Home Office challenged a Court of Appeal ruling from June that overturned the High Court's finding that Rwanda could be considered a 'safe third country' for migrants.

The strategy is aimed at deterring migrants from crossing the English Channel on small boats

Lawyers representing people facing deportation to the east African nation argued Rwanda is an 'authoritarian, one-party state' with a 'woefully deficient' asylum system.

But the Home Office has said the policy to remove asylum seekers to a 'country less attractive' than the UK, 'but nevertheless safe', is lawful.

The Illegal Migration Act brought into law the Government's policy of sending some asylum seekers to Rwanda.

However, the plans announced in April 2022 have been held up in the courts, with no deportation flights having taken place despite £140 million already being handed to Kigali.

Whereas Mrs Braverman repeatedly signalled she wanted out of the 'politicised court', Mr Cleverly said while foreign secretary in April he was 'not convinced' the move is necessary.

He said that the European countries that are not signatories - Russia and Belarus - are a 'small club', adding: 'I am not convinced it is a club we want to be part of.'

Mr Sunak has set stopping small boats of asylum seekers from arriving in Britain as one of his five pledges to the electorate.

But more than 27,300 migrants have been detected making unauthorised crossings of the English Channel so far this year, according to official figures.

The Right of the Tory party has insisted Britain must leave the European human rights treaty regardless of today's outcome.

UK human rights laws need a major overhaul 'whatever the outcome' of the Government's last-ditch legal appeal, the New Conservative group of backbenchers said.

Co-chairmen of the New Conservatives Miriam Cates and Danny Kruger said in a statement they remained committed to seeing Britain leave the European Convention on Human Rights.

'We will continue to campaign for a new framework for asylum policy that fulfils our moral obligations to genuine refugees while restoring control of our borders,' they said.

'Whatever the outcome of tomorrow's judgment on the Rwanda policy, we remain of the view that the UK should reform our domestic human rights and equalities laws and leave the ECHR.'

Who are the five Supreme Court judges who ruled against the Rwanda scheme?

Five Supreme Court justices decided the future of the Government's Rwanda deportation policy -

Lord Reed - President of the Supreme Court

Lord Reed, 67, (below) has led the 12-justice court since January 2020.

Over the course of more than a decade at the UK's top court, Lord Reed has been involved in some of its biggest cases, including the challenges over the prorogation of Parliament in 2019 and holding a Scottish independence referendum last year.

He previously served as a judge in Scotland and is also a member of a panel of ad hoc judges of the European Court of Human Rights.

In March last year, Lord Reed and deputy Supreme Court president Lord Hodge quit as non-permanent judges at Hong Kong' Court of Final Appeal amid concerns about the erosion of human rights.

Lord Reed was educated at the universities of Edinburgh and Oxford before qualifying as an advocate in Scotland and a barrister in England and Wales.

He has previously challenged claims that judges were meddling in political decision-making in the wake of the Supreme Court's ruling that former prime minister Boris Johnson's decision to suspend Parliament in 2019 was unlawful.

He told the BBC in October 2020: 'We don't do politics, we do decide legal questions which can have political ramifications and they can be important political consequences, but the issue we decide is strictly legal issue.'

Lord Hodge - Deputy President of the Supreme Court

Lord Hodge, 70, (below) was appointed deputy president of the UK's top court in January 2020.

The Scot, who succeeded compatriot Lord Reed when he became president, has served on the court since October 2013.

The judge was admitted to the Faculty of Advocates in 1983 and appointed a Queen's Counsel in 1996.

The Supreme Court judgment on the Government's plans to removal asylum seekers to Rwanda comes more than 18 months after they were first announced.

Ongoing legal battles have meant there has yet to be any migrants sent to the East African nation under the policy.

Meanwhile, the Channel migrant crisis continues amid much political debate.

Here is how events leading up to today's ruling have unfolded since the Rwanda plan was unveiled:

- 2022

April 14: Following a drastic increase in the number of people crossing the Channel, then-prime minister Boris Johnson announces a plan to deport migrants arriving in small boats to Rwanda for their claims to be processed. He says this would act as a 'very considerable deterrent'.

June 15: The first deportation flight to Rwanda is cancelled just minutes before take-off following a ruling by a judge at the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg.

August 23: The Ministry of Defence says 1,295 migrants made the crossing in 27 boats, a record figure which remains the highest figure for a single day.

September 26: Mrs Braverman uses a speech in the United States to advocate for the United Nations' Refugee Convention to be overhauled as part of wider efforts to stop small boats crossing the Channel - comments that are rebuked by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR).

In other comments criticised by equalities campaigners, she says offering asylum to a person because they are discriminated against in their home country for being gay or a woman is not sustainable.

(CBS) -- There was shock and sadness in McHenry County Monday night after the death of a well-known judge.

The Office of McHenry County Chief Judge Michael Chmiel announced Monday night that Associate Judge Michael Coppedge had been found unresponsive in his chambers at the Judicial Center in Woodstock that morning.

Court security and emergency services rushed to the scene and Coppedge was rushed to Northwestern Memorial Hospital, where he died. He was 61 years old.

""We are struck with shock and sadness at the Judicial Center today with the passing of Judge Coppedge,"" Chief Judge Chmiel said in a news release. ""He was one of the most thoughtful and professional persons many of us have ever met and was relied upon throughout the courthouse by all of us. He is and will be missed. Our good thoughts and prayers extend to him and his family.""

Judge Coppedge graduated cum laude from the College of St. Francis in Joliet in 1984, and then graduated cum laude from law school at Northern Illinois University.

He began his legal career clerking with Cowlin, Ungvarsky, Kukla and Curran, and after he passed the bar exam in 1987, he was hired as an associate and later a partner there.

Judge Coppedge had an extensive background in civil litigation, and real estate and local government law, the chief judge's office said.

He was sworn in as an associate judge in the 22nd Judicial Circuit on Nov. 10, 2015 - eight years ago last week - and presided over family, traffic, misdemeanor, and most recently felony cases, the chief judge's office said.","{'uri': 'cbsnews.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'CBS News'}",[],https://assets1.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2023/11/14/56495b93-e965-4490-ae7f-7746c3b9fc62/thumbnail/1200x630/2ab5df577767062a65beff0852b44cef/judge-michael-coppedge.jpg?v=8afad5e29ac9a704fff9d98ba34d3649,,-0.1450980392156863,26,26,CBS News,cbsnews.com

A New Zealand court has found the owner of White Island/Whakaari, the offshore volcano that erupted in 2019, killing 22 people, guilty on one charge of breaching workplace safety laws.

On Tuesday, Auckland district court ruled Whakaari Management Limited (WML), the holding company of landowners Andrew, James and Peter Buttle, had not met its obligations to visitors to the volcano.

The 2019 disaster killed 22 people - including 17 Australians - and left 25 others injured while triggering a debate over the safety of New Zealand's natural hazard and adventure tourism industry. The victims were on the east coast island as part of a tour operation that regularly ferried sightseers out for a closeup look at an active volcano.

WML was the only defendant left after charges against six other entities - including personal charges against the brothers - were previously dismissed by a judge.

In his judgment on Tuesday, Justice Evangelos Thomas criticised ""astonishing failures"" of safety audits given the ""obvious risks"", saying WML needed to take expert advice.

""The expert evidence ... was also common sense,"" he said.

""In WML's case, it should have appreciated that it could [not] rely on risk assessment work being done by others to relieve it of its own obligation in relation to risk ... it needed to stop and re-evaluate,"" he said.

""It should have been no surprise that Whakaari could erupt at any time, and without warning, at the risk of death and serious injury.""

The trial opened in July with emotional and graphic testimonies from numerous survivors who told the court they were not properly informed of Whakaari's risks.

Six other parties pleaded guilty to health and safety failings at the beginning of the trial with a sentencing hearing set for February 2024.

The verdict on Tuesday ends what started as an ambitious undertaking by WorkSafe, the country's workplace safety regulator. Investigators from the government agency originally charged 13 parties, including science agencies and tourism firms, with health and safety law breaches after the disaster. However, Worksafe's case crumbled as the judge dismissed the remaining charges except those against WML.

James Cairney, the lawyer for WML, had argued the company did not have active control in the day-to-day operations of tours to the island and was a landowner only.

The maximum punishment for the safety failings is a fine of $NZ1.5 million.

The disaster put a spotlight on the limits of New Zealand's no-fault compensation system, which automatically pays for some expenses of accident victims such as medical care, grants for funerals and loss of income. However, the system does not allow victims or their families to pursue further compensation with civil cases through the courts.

Some of the tourists who bought their tour ticket to Whakaari through Royal Caribbean Cruises sued the Florida-based company in the US court system.

Michael Winkleman, who represents several victims and victim families in the US, said some clients, including newlyweds Matt and Lauren Urey, have already settled with the cruiseliner for an undisclosed sum. He expects to reach settlement deals before the end of the year for his remaining clients, such as Australian Jesse Langford who was badly burned and lost his sister and parents in the tragedy.","{'uri': 'theguardian.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'The Guardian'}",[],https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e701fe61741240f3093e12327e0c6c5679dc819d/0_182_5472_3283/master/5472.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&s=6614990e24dd9510b38ff48b68359302,eng-9018542,-0.2549019607843137,26,26,The Guardian,theguardian.com

The justices heard arguments in the lawsuit that Dianne Hensley, a Christian elected Texas justice of the peace, filed against the State Commission on Judicial Conduct claiming her religious rights had been violated.

An appeals court last year upheld the dismissal of Hensley's complaint, which seeks damages and an injunction against future punishment.

The commission rebuked Hensley in 2019, finding her actions cast doubt ""on her capacity to act impartially to persons appearing before her as a judge due to the person's sexual orientation."" Hensley's lawsuit does not challenge that warning, and she did not appeal it. Her case instead claimed the commission had trampled on religious freedom rights.

At Wednesday's hearing, the justices wrestled with whether Hensley mistakenly failed to appeal the commission's warning, and whether the commission itself adequately considered her religious rights.

""Is the judicial conduct commission the appropriate forum to be deciding those sorts of delicate and important questions about how our rights are going to be balanced and how we are going to be governed?"" Justice Jimmy Blacklock asked a lawyer for the commission, Douglas Lang.

Lang defended the commission's ""responsibility and authority,"" and he argued Hensley's conduct, and not her religion, was at the heart of the commission's warning.

Lang said after the hearing that the justices were ""very interested in the positions of both sides.""

Hensley's attorney, Jonathan Mitchell, who was an architect of state anti-abortion legislative efforts, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

The U.S. Supreme Court in an historic 2015 decision said that same-sex couples had a right to marry nationwide.

Texas justices of the peace can be paid to officiate at weddings, but they are not required to officiate at any wedding. Hensley, a judge since 2015, hears misdemeanor and civil cases in Waco.

The judicial commission contends its warning does not constrain Hensley from practicing her faith. At the hearing, Lang said Hensley was seeking what he called a ""license to discriminate.""

Mitchell argued there was no state provision barring wedding officiants from discriminating on the basis of sex. ""If the legislature were to pass such a law, Judge Hensley would have to follow that,"" Mitchell told the justices.

The case is Dianne Hensley v. State Commission on Judicial Conduct, Supreme Court of Texas, No. 22-1145.

Other cases around the country are progressing, too.

The legal battle over Donald Trump's ballot eligibility in Colorado took yet another step closer to trial next week, as a state judge there rejected Trump-aligned dismissal efforts but without signaling an opinion on the ultimate outcome.

Colorado District Judge Sarah Wallace called ""pivotal"" the legal question of investigation and enforcement of the 14th Amendment's disqualification clause. But in resolving several issues in a Friday ruling, she said that crucial matter is ""best reserved for trial,"" which is set to begin Oct. 30.

Section 3 of the amendment bars anyone from office who took an oath to support the U.S. Constitution but then ""engaged in insurrection or rebellion against the same, or [has] given aid or comfort to the enemies thereof."" The Colorado suit was filed by Republican and unaffiliated voters, represented by Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, who want to protect the rights of voters ""to fully participate in the upcoming primary election by ensuring that votes cast will be for those constitutionally qualified to hold office.""

Other cases have been filed around the country, including in Minnesota -- where oral argument has been set for Nov. 2 -- and in Michigan.

And though Wallace rejected pretrial procedural claims from Trump and the Colorado Republican State Central Committee, the judge made clear she ""makes no judgments on the merits"" of Trump's ""constitutional fitness as a candidate by way of these rulings.""

Of course, what we want to know is how courts will decide Trump's eligibility, as he also faces several criminal and civil cases.

We still don't know, but we're closer to finding out -- this Colorado case could have national implications. And what the answer is through this first round of litigation could be less important than when it arrives, especially since the issue could be more definitively answered on appeal -- perhaps by the Supreme Court.","{'uri': 'msnbc.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'MSNBC.com'}",[],"https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_nbcnews-fp-1024-512,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2023-10/231023-Donald-Trump-al-0916-e3566d.jpg",eng-8994143,0.09019607843137245,26,26,MSNBC.com,msnbc.com

The Supreme Court seemed poised Tuesday after oral arguments to rule in favor of a federal law that bars individuals subject to certain domestic violence restraining orders from possessing firearms.

The case - argued in the wake of a mass shooting in Maine that killed 18 last month - is the first substantive Second Amendment case to come before the justices since they issued a landmark opinion last year expanding gun rights nationwide that's caused massive confusion in lower courts as dozens of firearms laws are reviewed.

For more than an hour, the justices referred to that case - New York State Rifle & Pistol Association, Inc. v. Bruen - with a majority indicating that the law being challenged falls comfortably within the nation's historical tradition of limiting Second Amendment rights when it comes to individuals - like the plaintiff in the case at hand -- who have been found to pose a danger to society.

Here's what to know:

The decision likely won't settle the confusion in lower courts on guns

As she stepped up to the podium, Solicitor General Elizabeth Prelogar argued that ""guns and domestic violence are a deadly combination.""

""All too often,"" she said, ""the only difference between a battered woman and a dead woman is the presence of a gun.""

""Throughout our nation's history, legislatures have disarmed those who have committed serious criminal conduct or whose access to guns poses a danger,"" she later added.

Some of the justices seemed inclined to agree on that point.

""You don't have any doubt that your client's a dangerous person, do you?"" Chief Justice John Roberts asked the attorney for Zackey Rahimi -- the respondent in the case who dragged the mother of his child through a parking lot in 2019, received a restraining order against him and went on a shooting spree that culminated with shots fired at a Whataburger restaurant in January 2021 after his credit card was declined.

When the court ultimately issues its opinion in several months, it likely will not resolve the confusion swirling in the lower courts concerning the framework judges should use as they consider a wide variety of gun laws.

Instead, the opinion could end up being closely tied to the facts in the case at hand, making clear, at the very least, that the Second Amendment does not protect those who have been found to be dangerous.

What compromises danger?

Prelogar insisted that Congress may disarm those ""who are not law abiding, responsible citizens.""

But Justice Clarence Thomas, who authored last year's Bruen decision and who in recent years asks the first question of every oral argument, challenged the government's proposed test in the case, signaling that he thought it was too broad.

In his baritone voice Thomas asked Prelogar to define what she meant by ""law abiding and responsible.""

Roberts jumped in as well. Would that include someone going 30 miles per hour in a 25 miles per hour zone? Would it matter if the person were guilty of a misdemeanor and not a felony? Roberts - thinking ahead to the next case - appeared to reject Prelogar's test as ""extremely broad.""

Roberts was not alone. The ACLU, a group always worried about mass incarceration, filed a friend-of-the-court brief in the case saying that it did not support the government's test. The ACLU said the court could resolve the case on a much more narrow legal ground: whether it has been determined that the individual poses a specific threat to others. The ACLU's brief might attract the attention of some conservatives who want to say the law at issue is okay for the case at hand, but go no further in other areas.

In her closing, Prelogar again emphasized the stakes.

""A woman who lives in a house with a domestic abuser is five times more likely to be murdered if he has access to a gun,"" she said.

All eyes on Justice Amy Coney Barrett

Long before she reached the high court, Justice Amy Coney Barrett issued an opinion that attracted the attention of gun rights supporters.

While sitting on the 7th US Circuit Court of Appeals, Barrett dissented when her colleagues rejected a Second Amendment challenge from a man with a felony for mail fraud who was prohibited from possessing a firearm under both federal and Wisconsin law.

""History is consistent with common sense: it demonstrates that legislatures have the power to prohibit dangerous people from possessing guns,"" Barrett wrote in 2019.

But she emphasized that the power extends only to people who are ""dangerous.""

She said that the fact that the law included all felons ""both violent and nonviolent"" made it unconstitutional as applied to the plaintiff in the case - suggesting she is interested in developing some kind of standard based on ""dangerousness.""

Tuesday, Barrett stressed the horrific circumstances surrounding Rahimi's actions as outlined in the protective order. Barrett noted that domestic violence is ""dangerous."" But looking to the next case she asked about ""more marginal cases"" that might not offend the constitution.

Justices Alito and Thomas express concerns about due process

Even the most ardent supporter of gun rights acknowledge that Rahimi provided the government with a good test case to revisit the court's opinion from last year.

So his lawyers, the National Rifle Association and even Justices Thomas and Samuel Alito focused on due process rights.

J. Matthew Wright -- a federal public defender, stressed more than once that that the civil proceeding that led to the issuance of the protective order had been ""one-sided"" and noted that Rahimi had not been provided with counsel at the time.

In court Tuesday, Alito asked procedural questions concerning whether a person subject to a protective order had any ""recourse"" if the person thought it had been wrongly issued. Thomas referred to the ""thin record"" in the case and wondered about the fact that the domestic violence allegations had been made in a civil - not a criminal - proceeding.

But their conservative colleague, Neil Gorsuch, noted that Rahimi hadn't made a due process claim - suggesting that would be a different challenge.

Due process was central to a friend of the court brief filed by the NRA in the case. The group noted that Rahimi was not prosecuted for the initial aggravated assault. Instead, the prosecutors took ""the easier route"" and pursued a protective order.

Ketanji Brown Jackson is no fan of the Bruen decision

Unlike the government and her liberal colleagues, Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson made crystal clear that she thought last year's opinion - dependent on ""historical tradition"" - was confusing and wrongly decided. (She was not on the bench yet when that case was decided.)

""I'm just trying to understand how the Bruen test works in a situation in which there is at least some evidence that domestic violence was not considered to be subject to the kinds of regulation that it is today,"" she said.

The founders, Jackson noted, were largely ""White, Protestant men.""

Justice Elena Kagan, who dissented in Bruen, did not go as far as Jackson. But she did ask Prelogar what the justices could do to clarify the opinion.

""There seems to be a fair bit of division and a fair bit of confusion about what Bruen means and what Bruen requires in the lower courts,"" Kagan said.","{'uri': 'cnn.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'CNN'}","[{'uri': 'ariane_de_vogue@cnn.com', 'name': 'Ariane De Vogue', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': False}]","https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/231107121004-03-supreme-court-protest-11072023.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill",eng-9035658,0.02745098039215677,8,8,CNN,cnn.com

The court will determine whether smokers who say they purchased cigarettes in response to deceptive ads can collectively sue the industry for the money they spent to smoke.

The court has grappled with the case for more than two years, trying to determine the reach of Proposition 64, a 2004 initiative intended to stop bogus lawsuits aimed at extorting money from small business. During the last several years, lower courts have tossed out many consumer class actions and scrutinized settlements more closely.

""Judges have started . . . wondering why there was a million dollars in attorneys fees and virtually nothing for the people who were supposedly defrauded,"" said Trent Norris, a San Francisco lawyer who defends corporations. ""California is part of a national trend.""

Nowhere was this skepticism more evident than in an order earlier this year by Los Angeles County Superior Court Judge Brett Klein.

Klein, asked to approve a class-action settlement, ordered the attorney who filed the suit to be paid the same way as consumers in the class, with $10 gift cards -- 12,500 of them -- to stores that sell prom dresses and other ware for teenage girls.

Klein's order came in a lawsuit charging that Windsor Fashion Store illegally required credit card users to provide their telephone numbers or e-mail or home addresses. Another judge overturned the order in February and awarded Yorba Linda lawyer Neil B. Fineman $125,000 in fees instead of gift cards.

Some advocates say beneficial consumer litigation is getting tossed along with the frivolous.

""The big picture is a broad assault on consumer protection laws by the defendants' lobby, with the growing support of the judicial branch,"" lamented Harvey Rosenfield, attorney for Consumer Watchdog, a nonprofit consumer advocacy group.

Proposition 64 amended the state's Unfair Competition Law to limit suits to people who have lost money or property.

Last month, an Alameda County judge, citing the measure's requirements, tossed out a class-action suit accusing Applebee's restaurants of misrepresenting the fat and nutrient content of lower-calorie meals. The judge said the consumers would have to show they had lost money -- a high bar given that the diet meals cost no more than the others.

Before Proposition 64, consumer, environmental and anti-poverty groups could sue over illegal practices even when no one lost money.

""We are looking at the death of . . . an enormously powerful consumer statute,"" said Sharon J. Arkin, a Los Angeles appellate lawyer for plaintiffs who bring the suits.

The tobacco case will determine whether class actions can be filed under the Unfair Competition Law. At issue is whether all members of the class must prove that the advertisements prompted them to buy cigarettes, a requirement that some attorneys said would doom the case.

The suit was brought on behalf of every Californian who was exposed to tobacco ads and bought cigarettes from 1998 to 2007. A similar suit in Michigan obtained a $10-billion jury award, Arkin said.

Lawyers for the smokers allege the tobacco industry misled people by suggesting that ""light"" or ""low-tar"" cigarettes were safer than other cigarettes. The suit also charges that the industry targeted minors.

Industry lawyers counter that the smokers were exposed to different ads and decided to smoke for different reasons, making a class action inappropriate. During oral argument, the state high court did not reveal how it was leaning.

The decision in the tobacco case may determine the outcome of several other pending cases. Most of the adverse rulings in consumer cases have come from a handful of state Courts of Appeal, primarily in San Diego and Orange counties, said class-action lawyer Timothy G. Blood of San Diego.

He cited a suit against Farmers Insurance Co. that said Farmers charged customers more money for paying monthly than for paying annually.

Although an appeals court found the practice violated the state insurance code and constituted a misdemeanor, it ruled that the people who sued had to show they would not have bought the policy if they had understood the different assessment, a requirement that some lawyers called an impossible legal challenge.

Another class action charged that Kwikset, a lock maker, violated the law by falsely claiming its products were made in the United States. A trial judge determined that the locks were substantially made outside the country, and the Federal Trade Commission made a similar finding and fined the company.

But the 4th District Court of Appeal, which has been a graveyard for similar suits, decided that the plaintiffs did not meet Proposition 64's requirements. No one claimed the locks didn't work.

Justice David G. Sills, presiding judge in the 4th District, called the Kwikset case ""precisely the sort of abuse that Proposition 64 was crafted to halt . . . lawsuits against businesses where lawyers make big bucks, and clients nothing, for finding some tiny, arguable technicality.""

Consumer advocates counter that the suits are based on laws. ""When people criticize these suits, they are really criticizing the law,"" Rosenfield said.

Class actions by nature usually yield more money to attorneys than to individuals in the class, Rosenfield said, noting that the system is designed for people whose losses are too small to make individual lawsuits worth bringing.

""We have hundreds of thousands of lawyers in California who, because they can make money on these cases, will bring them,"" said Arkin, past president of the Consumer Attorneys of California.

The climate for consumer class actions darkened as a result of scandals earlier in the decade when lawyers sued small businesses, such as auto shops and beauty shops, for minor code violations.

The lawyers pocketed the money the businesses paid to make the suits go away. Some later lost their law licenses.

""That burned through the legal community in a huge way, and people don't do that stuff anymore,"" Arkin said.

The imprisonment a year ago of William Lerach also drew wide attention to class-action abuses. The San Diego attorney paid people to be plaintiffs.

Other developments cited by lawyers were passage of a federal class-action law in 2005 and new state and federal guidelines that laid out ground rules for judges in such cases.

A state study of class actions from 2000 to 2006 showed that consumer suits have declined by 31% since 2002. Judges also threw out a higher portion of consumer class actions -- more than 24% -- than any other type.

The demise of what he calls frivolous suits has thrilled John H. Sullivan, president of the business-supported Civil Justice Assn. of California. He pointed to a ""fun"" ruling from the 4th District in a 2005 case against Starbucks.

The suit on behalf of 135,000 job applicants contended that the chain's job applications failed to clearly state that Californians were not required to report marijuana convictions more than two years old. Starbucks said the suit could cost it more than $27 million.

The three-judge panel scolded Starbucks and agreed that some Californians might have mistakenly believed they had to report pot convictions. But the panel tossed the suit on the grounds that none of the named plaintiffs had marijuana convictions.

""The civil justice system is not well served by turning Starbucks into a Daddy Warbucks,"" Justice Raymond J. Ikola wrote for the three-judge panel.

Class actions dumped by courts deserved it, said San Francisco corporate lawyer William Stern.

He cited a ""ridiculous"" lawsuit against the makers of Listerine for falsely advertising the mouthwash was as effective as flossing. In rejecting the suit, a Los Angeles-based appeals court said that Proposition 64 had ""dramatically"" restricted consumer protection measures and that the Listerine case illustrated ""the shortcomings of the initiative measure.""

The case is pending before the California Supreme Court, where Stern hopes it meets its demise.

""Society shouldn't redistribute income to gullible people,"" he said.

Washington, D.C.-founded Steptoe has hired 35 people from New York-founded Stroock, including 27 lawyers and eight business professionals, according to a Steptoe spokesperson.

The lawyers, which include key Stroock practice leaders, expand Steptoe's financial services, class action defense and insurance and reinsurance practices in New York, Los Angeles and Chicago.

The departures from Stroock come the same month that the firm and Nixon Peabody said they called off negotiations toward a proposed merger.

Stroock has reportedly discussed potential mergers with several other firms since at least last year, when it lost a group of 43 restructuring lawyers to Paul Hastings in March 2022.

""Our higher rate and most profitable practices remain intact and continue to serve clients at the highest level,"" a Stroock spokesperson said in a Wednesday statement. ""Our talks with other firms continue"" and are ""making good progress,"" the spokesperson said.

The team joining Steptoe includes partner Julia Strickland, who was managing partner of Stroock's Los Angeles office and head of the firm's national financial services litigation, regulation and enforcement group.

Another exiting lawyer, Michele Jacobson in New York, was chair of Stroock's general litigation practice. She was also co-chair of its insurance and reinsurance group alongside Robert Lewin, who is joining Stroock as senior counsel.

Other partners making the move include class action defense lawyer Stephen Newman and financial institutions-focused civil litigation lawyer Chris Fredrich in Los Angeles, and financial services regulatory and public policy lawyer Andrew Owens in New York, Steptoe said.","{'uri': 'reuters.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'Reuters'}","[{'uri': 'sara_merken@reuters.com', 'name': 'Sara Merken', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': False}]",https://www.reuters.com/resizer/LTn1a_-P2EGTAY4Vi6I3sITOu7w=/728x381/smart/filters:quality(80)/cloudfront-us-east-2.images.arcpublishing.com/reuters/PCJGLIKYV5PS3HYK325H2Q34NA.jpg,eng-9057881,0.07450980392156858,7,7,Reuters,reuters.com

CNN --

Marilyn Mosby, Baltimore's former top prosecutor who was thrust into the national spotlight after charging six police officers in the 2015 death of Freddie Gray, was found guilty of two counts of perjury for making false statements on loan applications for two Florida vacation homes, the Justice Department said.

Mosby, 42, pleaded not guilty last year to two counts of perjury and two counts of making false statements after authorities said she applied for the loans to withdraw money from her retirement accounts, tapping a CARES Act provision intended for those hurt financially during the Covid-19 pandemic, prosecutors said.

The former prosecutor is facing a maximum sentence of five years in prison for each of the two counts of perjury, the Justice Department said.

Mosby is also charged with two counts of making false mortgage applications for the vacation homes in another federal case which will be tried separately. A date for that trial has not yet been set, federal prosecutors said.

A federal grand jury indicted Mosby in January 2022 after authorities said she lied on the application by indicating she had ""adverse financial consequences"" due to the pandemic - even though she earned a gross salary of $247,955.58 that was ""never reduced"" in 2020, according to an indictment. She also failed to disclose she owed $45,000 in federal back taxes, it says.

She also allegedly said she would be the primary resident at one of the homes in order to secure a lower rate when she had already entered into an agreement with a rental management firm, the indictment says. She sold one of the homes for a $150,000 profit, The Baltimore Sun reported.

At the time, Mosby called the charges a ""political ploy"" and said she is ""unequivocally innocent.""

CNN has contacted Mosby's attorney for comment.

During closing arguments, Mosby's lead attorney and federal public defender Jams Wyda said the case is ""about a three-page form and what was in Marilyn Mosby's mind when she filled it out,"" CNN affiliate WBAL-TV reported. ""The government spent time on things that don't matter.""

Wyda said in court Mosby told the truth when she completed paperwork indicating the pandemic harmed her business, arguing she ""established the business, put money into it and was working to make it profitable in 2020.""

""She qualified and she reasonably believed she qualified. She is innocent,"" Wyda continued.

According to The Washington Post, Mosby said after the verdict outside the courthouse: ""I'm blessed. I'm blessed. I have nothing else to say.""

Mosby prosecuted 6 officers in Gray case

Before becoming state's attorney, Mosby graduated from Tuskegee University and Boston College Law School. During her studies at the latter, the Boston native worked in her hometown Suffolk County District Attorney's Office and in two US attorneys' offices.

After graduation, she prosecuted felonies in the Baltimore State's Attorney's Office from 2006 to 2011 before entering the corporate realm as a civil litigator. She decided in the summer of 2013 to run for the Baltimore state's attorney post.

She won and took office in January 2015.

On April 12, 2015, Freddie Gray encountered police officers in a high-crime area notorious for drug dealing. Gray, after making eye contact with police, ran. The officers arrested him on a weapons charge after finding a knife in his pocket, according to prosecutors.

Gray was put into the back of a police van without cameras, ""handcuffed, shackled by his feet and unrestrained."" He was found unresponsive 40 minutes later upon arriving at the police station, prosecutors said. After slipping into a coma, Gray died one week later from a spinal cord injury. The medical examiner's office ruled his death a homicide.

Less than two weeks after Gray was killed, Mosby charged six officers with misconduct along with assault, manslaughter or murder counts in the young man's death.

While Gray's death served as a rallying point for those decrying police brutality, none of the officers was convicted, despite the city paying Gray's family $6.4 million. Three were tried and acquitted, prompting Mosby to drop charges against the remaining three because of the ""dismal likelihood"" they'd be convicted, describing the decision as ""agonizing.""

Within weeks, five of the officers sued Mosby, alleging false arrest, defamation and other misdeeds. A federal appeals court ruled Mosby had immunity, and the US Supreme Court declined to hear an appeal, WBAL reported.

Despite the failed prosecution, the case instigated a new push for stronger police accountability laws and set the precedent in Baltimore and in cities across the country for implementing police reform, CNN previously reported.

As a result of the case, officers are now mandated to seat belt those in custody, call a medic when it's requested, and intervene when fellow officers cross the line, Mosby told CNN in 2021. Additionally, all police vans must be equipped with cameras.

In 2021, Mosby announced she would not prosecute drug possession and other low-level offenses, asserting there is ""no public safety value."" For Black Americans, Mosby said, ""These offenses can lead to a death sentence.""

The Supreme Court will hear arguments on Tuesday on whether the government may disarm people subject to domestic violence orders.

The question is important, of course, as studies have demonstrated that the combination of domestic strife and firearms can be lethal. The Supreme Court itself recognized this in a 2014 majority opinion. ""All too often, the only difference between a battered woman and a dead woman is the presence of a gun,"" Justice Sonia Sotomayor wrote for the court, quoting a lawmaker.

But the potential sweep of the decision in the new case extends far beyond domestic abuse. It will almost certainly yield a major statement on the meaning of the court's ruling last year vastly expanding people's right to arm themselves in public.

The argument comes as the nation struggles to address a seemingly unending series of mass shootings, including a recent one in Maine that left 18 people dead.

In last year's decision, New York State Rifle & Pistol Association v. Bruen, the court struck down by a 6-to-3 vote a New York law that put strict limits on carrying guns outside the home. It also announced a new legal standard, one whose reliance on historical practices has sown confusion as courts have struggled to apply it, with some judges sweeping aside gun control laws that have been on the books for decades.

The majority opinion in Bruen, written by Justice Clarence Thomas, said courts must now judge restrictions on gun rights by turning to early American history as a guide. ""The government must demonstrate,"" he wrote, ""that the regulation is consistent with this nation's historical tradition of firearm regulation.""

The new case, United States v. Rahimi, No. 22-915, gives the court a chance to explore the scope of that new test.

It concerns Zackey Rahimi, a drug dealer in Texas with a history of armed violence. He is ""hardly a model citizen,"" a federal appeals court judge wrote in March. But the court vacated Mr. Rahimi's conviction under a federal law that makes it a crime for people subject to domestic violence orders to have guns, ruling that the law violated the Second Amendment.

The appeals court, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, rejected a variety of old laws identified by the government as possible historical analogues, saying they did not sufficiently resemble the one concerning domestic violence orders. Many of them, Judge Cory T. Wilson wrote for the panel, ""disarmed classes of people considered to be dangerous, specifically including those unwilling to take an oath of allegiance, slaves and Native Americans.""

That was different, he wrote, from domestic violence orders, which make case-by-case judgments about a particular individual's dangerousness.

Lawyers for the administration have questioned that distinction. ""It would be bizarre,"" they told the justices, ""if legislatures could disarm dangerous individuals based on categorical presumptions, but not based on individualized judicial findings after notice and a hearing.""

Judge Wilson, who was appointed by President Donald J. Trump, wrote that the government's insistence that it could disarm people who were not law-abiding ""admits to no true limiting principle.""

""Could speeders be stripped of their right to keep and bear arms?"" he asked. ""Political nonconformists? People who do not recycle or drive an electric vehicle?""

Judge James C. Ho, who was also appointed by Mr. Trump, issued a concurring opinion saying there were other ways to protect victims of domestic abuse.

""Those who commit violence, including domestic violence,"" he wrote, ""shouldn't just be disarmed -- they should be detained, prosecuted, convicted and incarcerated. And that's exactly why we have a criminal justice system -- to punish criminals and disable them from engaging in further crimes.""

But Judge Ho said domestic violence orders were products of the civil justice system and were subject to abuse.

""That makes it difficult to justify"" the law Mr. Rahimi challenged, he wrote, ""as a measure to disarm dangerous individuals.""","{'uri': 'nytimes.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'The New York Times'}","[{'uri': 'adam_liptak@nytimes.com', 'name': 'Adam Liptak', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': False}]",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2023/11/07/multimedia/07dc-scotus-fgqv/07dc-scotus-fgqv-videoSixteenByNine3000.jpg,eng-9035658,-0.2784313725490196,7,7,The New York Times,nytimes.com

""We have no authority to authorize exceptions to an across-the-board, straight rule.""

The head of the Advisory Committee on Criminal Rules, U.S. District Judge James Dever, also said the glacial pace federal law prescribes for amending federal court rules means that, even if the panel approved a change, it wouldn't take effect until 2026 or 2027.

The slow amendment procedures are ""a feature, not a bug,"" said Dever, who sits in Raleigh, N.C. ""Once a rule becomes a rule, it's the law. It's not advice. It's the law.""

Trump is facing two federal criminal cases: one in Washington, D.C. stemming from his efforts to overturn the 2020 presidential election, and another in Florida stemming from his retention of sensitive national security documents at his Mar-a-Lago compound after leaving the White House. The D.C. trial is currently set to open in March, with the Florida trial set to follow in May, barring delays.

The former president and current frontrunner for the Republican presidential nomination also faces state-level criminal charges in New York and Georgia. Proceedings in the Georgia case, where four of Trump's co-defendants have already pleaded guilty, are being streamed live on YouTube, and any trial is expected to receive TV coverage. Criminal court proceedings in New York are not open to cameras.

While the committee said it was powerless to impact the federal Trump trials, it did agree Thursday to establish a subcommittee to look at whether the existing rule should be changed to allow for exceptions in extraordinary cases or perhaps to allow broadcasting in any criminal case where the judge deems it appropriate. The review will be headed by U.S. District Judge Robert Conrad, who sits in Charlotte, N.C.

After less than 15 minutes of discussion at a meeting Thursday in Minneapolis, the advisory panel agreed on its response to the Trump-focused request. One member -- U.S. Magistrate Judge G. Michael Harvey -- said drafting the official response to the lawmakers was a delicate matter.

""It's just somewhat tricky,"" Harvey said, in an apparent recognition that the commitment to study the issue is unlikely to satisfy the lawmakers. The committee's plan, Harvey said, probably is not ""ever going to provide these members of Congress with what they want with respect to these Trump trials.""

Harvey sits in Washington D.C., and has handled many criminal cases stemming from the Capitol riot on Jan. 6, 2021. He is not involved in Trump's case.

The lawmakers, led by Rep. Adam Schiff (D-Calif.), wrote in August to the federal judiciary's policymaking arm, the Judicial Conference, asking the body to ""explicitly authorize"" live broadcasting proceedings in the cases special counsel Jack Smith has brought against Trump.

""If the public is to fully accept the outcome, it will be vitally important for it to witness, as directly as possible, how the trials are conducted, the strength of the evidence adduced and the credibility of witnesses,"" Schiff and his colleagues wrote.

Spokespeople for Schiff did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the committee's action.

Earlier this month, lawyers for a coalition of news organizations, including POLITICO, sent the Judicial Conference a similar request to change the rule against broadcasting or otherwise allow an exception for the Trump trial set to open in D.C. in March.

""We all share an equal stake in the historic trial of our former President. Without cameras in the courtroom, the public will not have equal opportunity to assess the process and the result,"" the letter said.

Dever called the submission from the press ""very thoughtful,"" before announcing the broader policy issue would be passed to a subcommittee for study.

In addition to the effort to persuade judiciary branch officials to change the court's rules, media outlets have asked the judge assigned to the Washington trial, Tanya Chutkan, to allow TV broadcasting of the trial notwithstanding the current rules. Various news organizations, including POLITICO, are backing formal legal motions filed with the court earlier this month.

Chutkan has ordered prosecutors to respond to the requests by next week. She has not solicited a response from Trump's attorneys, although Trump has said he supports ""transparency"" in the court cases he is facing.

One veteran Justice Department lawyer involved in responding to the media request to Chutkan, Elizabeth Shapiro, was present at the meeting Thursday but told the group she was there solely as a guest. She did not speak during the discussion on the Trump trials.

A federal law passed by Congress in 2020 to address the coronavirus pandemic allowed federal criminal proceedings to take place by video or audio conferencing, but that provision expired soon after the health national emergency ended in May.

While the coronavirus provision was in effect, many federal courts allowed members of the press or public to access those virtual proceedings online, although broadcasting remained formally prohibited. The federal courts are continuing to allow remote access to some civil proceedings, but almost all trial-court action in federal criminal cases can only be observed in person.","{'uri': 'politico.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'POLITICO'}",[],https://static.politico.com/9f/86/3f7daaa7496e8b5dbcdf7830a228/https-delivery-gettyimages.com/downloads/1479828982,eng-9011245,-0.1529411764705882,6,6,POLITICO,politico.com

Unpacking what the court term means for a defendant,"Legalese is practically its own language and sometimes you need a lawyer or a legal dictionary to decipher the meaning of legal terms. From ""acquittal"" to ""writ of certiorari,"" there's at least one term or phrase associated with almost every letter of the alphabet. For some letters, there are several.

You do not need to be a lawyer to know some legalese. In fact, you probably already know a bit. Nevertheless, it's important to recognize and understand what some of it means, especially if you're called for jury duty.

If you want to brush up on your law vocabulary, here is what a mistrial is and what happens when a judge calls a mistrial.

When a jury is unable to reach a verdict after numerous attempts (a ""hung jury"") then a mistrial results.

A mistrial can also occur if a judge determines there has been a procedural error or misconduct that could prejudice the jury. According to Cornell Law, some of the procedural grounds for a judge to declare a mistrial include:

Mistrials can be declared in criminal or civil court proceedings.

Requests for a mistrial are often made immediately after an error occurs, states Cornell Law. This is done in order to avoid tainting the verdict with ""prejudice.""

What happens if you have a mistrial?

If a mistrial occurs, the current trial is terminated and considered ""void,"" according to Britannica. This means that the prior proceedings are no longer valid, and the process for a new trial must begin with the same parties and charges but a new jury (if there is a jury).

Because a mistrial is neither a finding of innocence or guilt, a prosecutor in a criminal case can decide to retry the defendant.","{'uri': 'usatoday.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'USA Today'}",[],"https://www.gannett-cdn.com/presto/2021/06/09/NTFO/511c7b78-1a73-466d-abea-e535c8b0cb6e-gavel.jpg?auto=webp&crop=499,281,x0,y25&format=pjpg&width=1200",,0.07450980392156858,6,6,USA Today,usatoday.com

Fossil fuel companies have spent millions of dollars on lobbying and campaign donations to state lawmakers who sponsored anti-protest laws - which now shield about 60% of US gas and oil operations from protest and civil disobedience, according to a new report from Greenpeace USA.

Eighteen states including Montana, Ohio, Georgia, Louisiana, West Virginia and the Dakotas have enacted sweeping anti-protest laws which boost penalties for trespass near so-called critical infrastructure, that make it far riskier for communities to oppose pipelines and other fossil fuel projects that threaten their land, water and the global climate.

Another four states have enacted narrower versions of the same law, but which could still be exploited to issue trumped-up charges against peaceful protesters. Many were based on a ""model bill"" promoted by the industry-funded American Legislative Exchange Council (Alec).

According to the report, nine of the top 10 companies that lobbied most for anti-protest bills since 2017 are fossil fuel companies, including US companies ExxonMobil, Koch Industries and Marathon Petroleum, as well as Canadian companies Enbridge and TC Energy (Trans Canada).

In addition, 25 fossil fuel and energy companies have contributed more than $5m to state anti-protest bill sponsors in this timeframe, data from political finance trackers Open Secrets and Follow the Money shows.

According to Dollars v Democracy 2023: Inside the Fossil Fuel Industry's Playbook to Suppress Protest and Dissent in the United States , a playbook of tactics has been deployed by corporations, law enforcement agencies and fossil fuel-friendly lawmakers in the US since the Dakota Access Pipeline (DAPL) protests at Standing Rock in 2016. This includes mass arrests, spurious litigation, intelligence sharing, harsh policing tactics such as water cannons and sophisticated public relations efforts to depict activists as troublemakers and extremists, the report says.

It's part of a global strategy reported by the Guardian to silence, discredit and criminalize environmental activists and Indigenous rights defenders opposed to polluting energy, mining and other extractive projects that are incompatible with meaningful climate action.

""We are seeing an escalation of tactics to criminalize, bully, and sue those working for climate action, Indigenous rights and environmental justice... [as] oil and gas companies find new ways to delay the transition to clean energy and protect their own profits,"" said Ebony Twilley Martin, the executive director of Greenpeace USA. ""Frontline activists should not face extreme, life-altering legal risks for putting their bodies on the line to keep our planet habitable.'

Since 2017, more than 250 anti-protest bills have been introduced in 45 states including legislation to eliminate driver liability for hitting protesters and create felony offenses for demonstrations construed as riots, according to the International Center for Not-for-Profit Law (ICNL).

The bills appear to have proliferated as a response to prominent student, environmental and racial justice movements such as Standing Rock and Black Lives Matter, and experts say they restrict the first amendment protected right to free speech, assembly and protest.

Lawmakers have claimed that the bills are needed to prevent violence, despite the laws banning violent acts and property damage already existing while the overwhelming majority of protests in the US are nonviolent.

In Minnesota, law enforcement - which along with other agencies received millions of dollars in payments from the Canadian company Enbridge behind Line 3 - more than 1,000 arrests were made between December 2020 and September 2021 as nonviolent protesters tried to stop the rerouting and expansion of the 1,097-mile tar sands oil pipeline through Indigenous lands and waterways. At least 967 criminal charges were filed including three people charged under the state's new critical infrastructure protection legislation.

Fossil fuel firms are also increasingly using civil litigation to intimidate activists and chill legitimate dissent, according to the new report.

Greenpeace found that about 75% (86 out of 116) of known Slapps - strategic lawsuits against public participation - and other forms of judicial harassment cases since 2010 were linked to companies that have also lobbied for anti-protest criminal laws including ExxonMobil, Chevron and TransCanada. The Slapps include a $300m lawsuit filed against Greenpeace US by the Canadian company behind the DAPL, Energy Transfer, which alleges that the non-profit organized the massive Indigenous resistance at Standing Rock. The case, which experts fear could have major ramifications for advocacy, is scheduled to open in North Dakota next summer.

This year has marked a further blow to the constitutional right to protest in the US, starting with the fatal police shooting of forest protector and anti-Cop City activist Manuel Esteban Paez Terán in Atlanta in January 2023. It was the first case in US history of police killing an environmental activist while protesting.

In September, the Georgia state attorney general indicted 61 community organizers on racketeering charges, alleging that those who peacefully opposed the construction of the sprawling police training complex were part of a criminal enterprise. The officers who peppered Paez Terán with 14 bullets, leaving 57 wounds, will face no charges.

Also this year, developers of the Mountain Valley pipeline (MVP) - which will transport fracked gas 300 miles through West Virginia and Virginia - filed a $4m civil lawsuit which seeks to restrict 41 individuals and two organizations from fundraising and other activities alleged to have slowed construction. While in North Carolina a draconian new anti-protest law allows up to 19 years in prison and $250,000 in fines for impeding an energy facility.

David Armiak, research director with the Center for Media and Democracy, said the Greenpeace report ""exemplifies how the fossil fuel industry exerts its outsized influence over state and local politics to curtail the constitutional right to protest with the goal of extending its profit model"".

He added: ""As the climate emergency intensifies, policy makers should adhere to the authors' recommendations and pass anti-Slapp laws, repeal anti-protest policies and ensure that treaties with Indigenous communities are respected.""

The American Petroleum Institute (API), an oil and gas industry trade association, said it supported the ""public's first amendment right to peaceful protest"" but strongly opposed ""any criminal activity or physical violence that could put lives, communities and the environment at risk"".

In a statement it added: ""We share the urgency of confronting climate change together without delay; yet doing so by eliminating America's energy options is the wrong approach and would leave American families and businesses beholden to unstable foreign regions for higher cost and far less reliable energy.""","{'uri': 'theguardian.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","[{'uri': 'nina_lakhani@theguardian.com', 'name': 'Nina Lakhani', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': False}]",https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e2a88a31aab6a21a5a6a0f99b2eddad14737b10c/0_77_5616_3370/master/5616.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&s=96a6aff4245c4ba8ced3b641bb69f11a,,-0.003921568627450966,6,6,The Guardian,theguardian.com

The Republican ticket features Smail, who is a Westmoreland County Court of Common Pleas judge, and Battista, who is a lawyer in Clarion County. Smail started his tenure in Westmoreland County in 2015.

Battista was counsel for the Department of Health, as well as the Department of State. She also was a hearing examiner for the Department of Corrections.

As for the Democratic ticket, Beck, a Pittsburgh native, is a civil litigator at Blank Rome LLP. She currently resides in the Squirrel Hill neighborhood of Pittsburgh.

Lane is a Court of Common Pleas judge after being elected to that position in 2013. The West Philadelphia native served as the chief legal counsel for a state senator and the executive director for the Pennsylvania State Senate State Government Committee.

Both seats on the Superior Court were open due to a Republican judge retiring, and another judge reaching the mandatory retirement age of 75.

Some male students in the sophomore class of Westfield High School in New Jersey used an AI-powered website to generate pornographic images of their classmates using girls' photos found online.

One of the victims Francesca Mani, who is just fourteen, has filed a police report.

'At first I cried, and then I decided I should not be sad. I should be mad and should advocate for myself and the other victims' Mani told the Wall Street Journal.

Her mother, Dorota Mani told the publication 'I am terrified by how this is going to surface and when. My daughter has a bright future and no one can guarantee this won't impact her professionally, academically or socially.'

Another victim said: 'We're aware that there are creepy guys out there but you'd never think one of your classmates would violate you like this.'

Westfield High School Principal Mary Asfendis alerted parents to the situation in an email on October 20.

'This is a very serious incident,' Asfendis wrote.

'New technologies have made it possible to falsify images and students need to know the impact and damage those actions can cause to others.'

Asfendis said she believed the images had now been deleted and were no longer being circulated.

A spokesperson for Westfield Public Schools told the Journal they would not provide details on the number of students involved or confirm whether any disciplinary action had been taken, due to student confidentiality.

'To be in a situation where you see young girls traumatized at a vulnerable stage of their lives is hard to witness,' Westfield's first female Mayor Shelley Brindle told the publication.

More than 90% of such false imagery known as 'deep fakes' are porn, according to image-detection firm Sensity AI.

States, including Virginia, California, Minnesota and New York, have outlawed the distribution of faked porn or given victims the right to sue its creators in civil court however experts believe federal law is failing to keep up with technological changes of this sort.

The federal judge overseeing former President Donald J. Trump's prosecution on charges of mishandling classified documents signaled on Wednesday that she was inclined to make some ""reasonable adjustments"" to the timing of the case, expressing concern that it could ""collide"" with Mr. Trump's other federal trial.

Speaking during a hearing in Federal District Court in Fort Pierce, Fla., the judge, Aileen M. Cannon, did not specify how she planned to change the schedule of the documents case and said she would soon issue a written order with the details.

But she seemed skeptical that the trial date in the documents case -- now set for May 20 -- could comfortably coexist with Mr. Trump's Washington-based trial on charges of plotting to overturn the 2020 election, which is set to start in early March.

""I'm having a hard time seeing, realistically, how this work can be accomplished in this compressed time period,"" Judge Cannon said.

She was responding to the latest request by Mr. Trump's lawyers to delay the proceedings, part of a pattern in which they have sought to push his trial dates back as far as possible. Mr. Trump has made no secret of his hopes to postpone any legal reckoning until after Election Day. That could provide him a chance, should he win the presidency again, to order the federal charges against him dropped or to attempt to pardon himself in the federal cases if convicted.

The timing of Mr. Trump's criminal trials -- two in federal court in Florida and Washington and two more in state courts in Georgia and New York -- has added a layer of logistical complexity to the already fraught legal and political challenges of pursuing charges against him as he mounts another run for the country's highest office.

The proceedings have needed to be slotted on the calendar not only in relation to one another, but also against the backdrop of an increasingly busy campaign season. Complicating matters, no single person or authority has been coordinating the arrangements, which have seemed at times like competing air traffic controllers trying to land four airplanes on the same runway with a hurricane blowing in.

Mr. Trump's lawyers and prosecutors in the office of the special counsel, Jack Smith, have been fighting over the timing of the documents trial almost from the moment an indictment in the case was filed in June in Federal District Court in Fort Pierce, Fla. The indictment charges the former president with illegally holding on to 32 classified national security documents after he left office and then conspiring with two personal aides to obstruct the government's repeated efforts to get the documents back.

Mr. Trump's legal team has repeatedly argued that the case should go to trial only after the 2024 election is over. They rarely mention in public, however, that if that were to happen and Mr. Trump were to win the race, he could dispose of the charges by having his attorney general simply drop them.

In court on Wednesday, Todd Blanche, a lawyer for Mr. Trump said something had to give, suggesting it was unworkable to try the former president in Washington in March on the election interference indictment then suddenly try him again in Florida in May on the classified materials charges.

""The real pressure on President Trump and on us, his counsel,"" Mr. Blanche said, ""is the compressed schedule in the case in Washington, D.C., and the schedule in this case.""

Echoing that position, Christopher M. Kise, who is working with Mr. Blanche on the case, warned Judge Cannon of the ""challenges of having close-in-time or even overlapping trials.""

Mr. Kise was a kind of case study for his own argument, having dialed in to the Florida hearing while on break from yet another one of Mr. Trump's trials: a civil proceeding in Manhattan in which his company has been accused of fraudulently inflating the value of his real estate holdings.

Jay I. Bratt, a prosecutor in the special counsel's office, started his own remarks to Judge Cannon by accusing Mr. Trump's lawyers of using the same tactic over and over in the classified documents case -- namely, trying ""to delay it as long as they can.""

But Mr. Bratt sidestepped Judge Cannon when she asked him if he could think of any other situation in which a criminal defendant was facing trial in ""multiple jurisdictions"" and might face the ""unavoidable reality that the schedules could collide.""

While the questions about timing were consequential, some of the details discussed at the hearing were exceedingly technical.

Mr. Trump's lawyers have claimed that one of the reasons the trial should be pushed back is to avoid rushing the complex process of receiving and digesting the voluminous discovery evidence provided to them by the government and then using that material to file pretrial motions.

The lawyers also raised a host of logistical concerns that have slowed down the case as it makes its way toward trial.

For instance, Stanley Woodward Jr., a lawyer for Mr. Trump's co-defendant, Walt Nauta, said that he had not yet obtained a full security clearance for the most sensitive documents involved in the case.

There have also been delays in building secure facilities in which to review the classified materials, including one at the Fort Pierce courthouse for Judge Cannon.

During the hearing, Mr. Trump's lawyers offered a few hints about potential defenses they might use to fight the indictment in the case.

Mr. Blanche said he might seek to cast doubt on whether some of the documents actually contained so-called national defense information. He also suggested that even after leaving office, Mr. Trump maintained a special security clearance that gave him permission to possess at least one of the classified documents that he has been charged with holding on to.","{'uri': 'nytimes.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'The New York Times'}",[],https://static01.nyt.com/images/2023/11/01/multimedia/01DC-TRUMP-DOCS-mgfp/01DC-TRUMP-DOCS-mgfp-videoSixteenByNine3000.jpg,eng-9021554,-0.2470588235294118,5,5,The New York Times,nytimes.com

He criticises Switzerland for doing too little to prevent an intimidation suit against the Bruno Manser Fund in Basel.

A spokesman for the Federal Office for the Environment confirmed to the Swiss News Agency Keystone-SDA on Friday that it had received the letterExternal link. The letter will be answered, he said. However, the office is not yet saying anything about the timing and content of the reply.

Forst had sent the letter on August 8, 2023 and asked for a reply by October 7. The letter has since been published on the website of the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE).

In it, Forst expresses ""grave concern"" about several legal steps taken by the Malaysian-Canadian entrepreneurial couple Jamilah Taib Murray and Sean Murray and their company Sakto Corporation against the Bruno Manser Fund. He pointed to the ""apparent use"" of court proceedings, the lodging of criminal complaints and the PR campaign by Sakto and its Swiss-based agents to ""silence"" the environmental organisation and its director Lukas Straumann. This, he said, would prevent the Bruno Manser Fund from exercising its rights under the Aarhus Convention.

+ Who was Bruno Manser?

Forst refers to Article 3 paragraph 8 of this UN Convention, which regulates rights in matters of environmental protection. It requires that persons exercising their rights in accordance with this Convention not be ""penalised, persecuted or harassed in any way"" for doing so. The Special Rapporteur writes that he is ""deeply concerned"" that Switzerland is not fulfilling its obligation under the Aarhus Convention to ensure that precisely this is prevented.

He calls on the government to exhaust all legal means to prevent so-called Slapp lawsuits (strategic lawsuits against public participation). In addition, it must provide information on the ethical guidelines for lawyers in Slapp lawsuits.

+ Rooting out corruption in the forests of Borneo

The letter was prompted by several legal actions against the Bruno Manser Fund. Most recently, a hearing took place on August 16, 2023, before the Civil Court of Basel City. The Taib-Murray couple, represented by the Basel law firm Vischer, sued for alleged violation of personality rights. The legal dispute is not yet over, as both parties were unable to reach an agreement during settlement talks.

The background is various publications by the Bruno Manser Fund about Jamilah Taib Murray. She is the daughter of Abdul Taib Mahmud, who served as head of government of the Malaysian state of Sarawak for 33 years. There, the environmental activist Bruno Manser, who was declared missing in 2005, fought with the indigenous Penan people against the deforestation of the rainforest.","{'uri': 'swissinfo.ch', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'SWI swissinfo.ch'}",[],https://www.swissinfo.ch/resource/image/48929878/landscape_ratio16x9/1920/1080/28016f15a96ed08002bc744442968d08/2001D32C45C5C9FFCD49352701FAA714/1408834_highres.jpg,,-0.07450980392156858,5,5,SWI swissinfo.ch,swissinfo.ch

That's very incorrect.

Former President Donald Trump has offered up some questionable arguments to try to squirm out of legal trouble before. But his latest argument may be the boldest yet. Trump is claiming that it's unconstitutional to proceed with the federal case charging him with trying to overturn the 2020 presidential election and subvert lawful votes because he was acquitted for those same activities in his second impeachment trial.

That argument was included in one of three motions to dismiss that Trump's lawyers filed Monday night. Claiming, as Trump's team does, that ""the impeachment and double jeopardy clauses both bar retrial before this Court and require dismissal"" requires a willful misunderstanding of the impeachment process.

Trump's lawyers focus on Article I, Section 3, of the U.S. Constitution, which deals with the possible sentences for impeachment convictions, specifically the part that reads, ""the Party convicted shall nevertheless be liable and subject to Indictment, Trial, Judgment and Punishment, according to Law."" You might read that and think that it's bad for Trump, as it clearly implies that an official who's been impeached can be criminally charged. But, in an amazing bit of spin, Trump's team treats the word ""convicted"" as his get-out-of-jail-free card. According to Trump's motion: ""As the Senate acquitted President Trump, the prosecution may not re-try him in this Court.""

That's incredibly wrong for several reasons. First, there is a very clear distinction between impeachment trials, which are political, and criminal trials, which ought not to be. There is no standard in a Senate impeachment trial that comes close to the ""beyond a reasonable doubt"" standard in a criminal case. Nor is there any need for unanimity among the jury as in federal criminal cases, as only two-thirds of senators are required to vote in favor of conviction -- which thanks to partisanship can be an even higher bar.

According to the Constitution, the required punishment for an official convicted in an impeachment trial is removal from office. The other, optional sentence is to be barred from holding any future office, a punishment that would have blocked Trump from his current presidential run. In the federal criminal case charging him with trying to overturn the 2020 election, Trump is charged twice with a crime that carries a maximum prison sentence of 20 years, once with a crime that has a maximum 10-year sentence and once with a crime that has a maximum five-year sentence.

The idea that the Senate's trial of Trump -- where acquittal was a foregone political conclusion, divorced from the facts that a criminal trial requires -- put him ""in jeopardy of life or limb"" makes no sense. He was in danger of, at most, not being able to hold office again, not any sort of jail time or monetary fine. And even then, Senate Republicans claimed (incorrectly, in my view) that because Trump had left office by the time of his second impeachment trial, he couldn't be convicted in the upper chamber but that the regular courts would be able to sort things out. As Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell said in his speech after voting to acquit, ""We have a criminal justice system in this country. We have civil litigation. And former presidents are not immune from being held accountable by either one.""

In his ""Commentaries on the Constitution,"" Justice Joseph Story, one of the first scholars of the Constitution and an expert McConnell cited in his speech, did write that even after leaving office, former officials were ""still liable to be tried and punished in the ordinary tribunals of justice."" He also wrote what is a clear rebuttal to the argument about ""double jeopardy"" that Trump's lawyers put forth on Monday night:

Translation: These are two very different courts exercising very different powers. It makes zero sense that an acquittal in an impeachment court, with its limited scope, should prevent a criminal court from trying the same person for those actions under the full scope of the law. Otherwise, someone like, for example, a former president, could walk away scot-free because an impeachment court didn't use its limited powers to punish a crime that would normally draw much more severe penalties.

Let's not forget that a federal judge already dismissed Trump's claim in a civil lawsuit that the Senate's acquittal triggered the ""double jeopardy"" clause. ""President Trump offers no evidence to support a conclusion that the Framers intended for the absence of any reference to an acquitted officer following impeachment to mean that such official could not be subject to judicial process,"" Judge Amit Mehta wrote in February 2022.

As far as long shots go, this latest one is a doozy. There's an air of desperation in trying a play that has already failed, especially one that has failed so spectacularly.

But silencing a defendant isn't a good thing.,"Former President Donald Trump told reporters he's appealing a gag order set by a judge handling his Washington, D.C. trial.

""In what kind of case do you think it would be appropriate for a criminal defendant to call the prosecutor a thug and stay on the streets?"" U.S. District Judge Tanya Chutkan asked Donald Trump's attorney John Lauro on Monday during a hearing on whether the former president's speech should be restricted.

Lauro didn't provide the correct answer, which is this: all of them.

Although it doesn't appear to be a common occurrence - there's only one published instance where a defendant allegedly admitted to calling the U.S. attorney assigned to his case names - this happens often enough. Criminal defendants have just as much disdain for prosecutors as the prosecutors have for them. Their displeasure is expressed outside of court. The only difference with Trump's calling special counsel Jack Smith a thug is that no one was listening when these other defendants insulted their prosecutors.

Talking smack is part of the game. To suggest that it doesn't happen is not only disingenuous on Judge Chutkan's part, it's also a misunderstanding of the importance of the defendant's voice in criminal cases - one that could prove unconstitutional. It's almost like the former public defender doesn't understand defense.

Does the partial gag order violate Trump's rights?

A defendant's rights may be in tension with the First Amendment rights of the news media, but that's not what's happening with the former president. This isn't even a situation where a lawyer's speech is restrained. That has happened in the past on occasion, such as the gag order in the trial of the Los Angeles police officers accused of beating Rodney King. Those are the two situations that courts have reviewed in the past, but telling a defendant he can't speak is unprecedented.

In the federal election conspiracy case against Trump - he could be facing 55 years in prison if convicted and sentenced to the maximum on each of the four conspiracy and obstruction charges - what Chutkan did was the inverse of a Fifth Amendment violation.

If the judge had compelled Trump to speak somehow, that would be a clear violation of his right not to incriminate himself - namely, to keep himself un-convicted and free. Yet, when he wants to say something that he thinks would keep himself un-convicted and free, she's stepping on that right.

Judge issues partial gag order: Trump, who never shuts up, now has a gag order to whine about. And you know he will.

While for some it might be wise not to testify in one's own defense, some studies suggest an acquittal is more likely when a defendant tells their story.

Even if taking the witness stand in one's own criminal case is ill-advised, defendants can't legally be stopped from speaking to protect themselves. The Supreme Court has held that preventing someone from testifying in court in a case against themselves violates the due process clause of the 14th Amendment and the compulsory process clause of the Sixth Amendment.

Gag order played a role in O.J. Simpson trials

There have been very few studies of the First Amendment's role in criminal courtrooms. One, authored by George Washington University Law School professor Daniel Solove, examines the ways that the First Amendment operates with the Fourth and Fifth Amendments and how government searches of suspects' intellectual property deserves more attention.

In the article, Solove argued that the First Amendment doesn't get enough consideration in criminal courtrooms but, notably, doesn't even mention a case of a court telling a defendant not to speak. It's practically unthinkable.

Because criminal cases threaten an individual's freedom and possibly life, courts have to give a defendant more leeway in speech. That's why in People v. O.J. Simpson, there were no gag orders in the criminal case under former Superior Court Judge Lance Ito - Ito floated the idea but never followed through on it.

However, the judge assigned to the subsequent civil case filed by Ron Goldman's family restricted speech of the parties in what has been called a ""sweeping"" order. All that was at stake in those civil proceedings was civil liability - i.e., money.

Chutkan's - and the public's - inability to equalize the First and Fifth Amendments as they pertain to criminal defendants shows just how hard it is to convince people that every accused person is innocent - until they're convicted and they may be actually innocent after that, too. If there's a defense to be made, there's no reason why the defendant shouldn't be able to speak it. In fact, for people whose freedom is jeopardized, the right to speak becomes even more important.

Don't obstruct sentencing reform: First Step Act advanced prison reform, but hundreds are still serving unjust sentences

The judge was correct when she said that the former president ""does not have the right to say and do exactly what he pleases."" He doesn't. He can't threaten people.

And laws exist to cover that. They're in the criminal code of every state and the federal government, and if law enforcement thinks Trump violated those statutes then he should be charged as anyone else would be.

The constitutional fallout of Chutkan's partial gag order is yet to be seen; Trump has said that he'll appeal it before the case is over.

Stopping him from speaking is stopping him from defending himself, and that's something no judge presiding over a criminal case should ever be allowed to do.","{'uri': 'usatoday.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'USA Today'}",[],"https://www.gannett-cdn.com/authoring/authoring-images/2023/10/19/USAT/71245257007-chutkan-trump-smith.jpg?auto=webp&crop=8523,4797,x327,y0&format=pjpg&width=1200",,-0.3568627450980392,5,5,USA Today,usatoday.com

The fraud trial is just the first in a long stretch of legal battles the former president is set to endure as he seeks to return to the White House next year. And it's the public's first glimpse of how candidate Trump conducts himself in and around the courtroom. Though his behavior -- defiant, exasperated and often unruly -- is no surprise, it is likely merely a taste of what's to come.

He's facing three criminal trials in the first half of next year and a fourth yet to be scheduled -- a gauntlet that guarantees his court dates will effectively become an extension of his political campaign. Indeed, Trump has already used the fraud trial in New York as a makeshift campaign stop, even injecting some of his frequent stump-speech lines into his testimony on Monday.

But in some ways, the upcoming criminal trials will make the circus surrounding the fraud trial look like a sideshow. The stakes will be even higher, the political temperature will be even hotter and the restrictions on Trump's conduct will be more onerous than the relatively lax procedures of the civil fraud case.

It's an immovable-object-meets-unstoppable-force scenario: What happens when the unbending rules that govern criminal trials collide with an explosive politician-defendant who shows no inkling of modifying his behavior?

When it comes to courtroom restrictions, perhaps the most significant difference between Trump's fraud trial and his criminal trials is that the fraud trial will be decided solely by a judge, whereas the criminal cases will all have juries.

When jurors are in the room, judges tend not to tolerate anything less than strict decorum. They will likely order Trump to avoid talking or even gesturing while jurors are in the room, unless he is testifying. And if he takes the witness stand, he will be directed to keep his answers tight and directly responsive to the question because jurors are not supposed to hear inadmissible evidence.

For bench trials, the environment is often more relaxed -- and Trump has taken advantage of that in the fraud case.

Even as Justice Arthur Engoron admonished Trump on Monday for some of his antics, the judge often allowed him to deliver rambling answers that had little to do with the questions at hand.

Catherine Christian, a former prosecutor with the Manhattan district attorney's office, said that was likely a strategic choice by the judge, both because there was no jury present and because it will provide the Trump team with less ammunition to claim bias during an appeal.

""If a jury was there, Trump would have been done,"" Christian said. ""You cannot allow a jury to hear that."" With testimony that isn't responsive and therefore isn't considered admissible evidence, ""you have to keep calling the jury out of the room all day long,"" she said. ""Trump would have been warned, then sanctioned, then held in contempt.""

But without a jury, both Engoron and Trump's own lawyers acknowledged that the rules could be loosened.

Arguing for Trump to be allowed ""latitude"" in his responses, Trump lawyer Chris Kise said Monday: ""It is a bench trial, there is no jury. If it is his view, it is his view.""

When a lawyer for the attorney general's office objected to an answer Trump provided, calling it repetitive and nonresponsive, the judge responded: ""Leave it in. There's no jury. It doesn't matter.""

Trump's criminal trials will also impose a practical problem for Trump: He will be required to show up.

He isn't obligated to attend trials in his civil cases, and in the fraud trial, he has come to court just a few days a week, when it suits him, sometimes staying for only part of a day.

But in criminal court, he will be required to attend trial all day, every day -- an enormous time commitment in the middle of the presidential race. In Trump's federal trial in Washington, D.C., on charges related to election interference, prosecutors have estimated their case could take as long as two and a half months. In Fulton County, Georgia, where Trump faces similar election charges, prosecutors said it could take four months to present their case.

Trump also won't be allowed to simply walk out of the courtroom when he wants, as he did recently in the fraud case even as court was in session. About 30 minutes after his former lawyer and fixer, Michael Cohen, finished testifying against him, Trump stood up angrily and exited the courtroom as the judge was conducting other business, sending U.S. Secret Service agents scurrying after the former president.

Trump's behavior will likely be restricted in more granular ways, too.

In New York, Trump has transformed the Manhattan courthouse into his personal briefing room, using his entrances to and exits from the courtroom to address the dozens of news cameras arranged in the hallway. There, he has held forth on topics including witness testimony, the recent race for speaker of the House and, perhaps most frequently, Engoron, the judge overseeing the trial.

None of that will be allowed during his two federal criminal cases. Federal courthouses don't permit news cameras anywhere inside and often restrict informal gaggles even without cameras. That may mean that Trump isn't able to communicate with reporters -- and, by extension, the public -- for hours at a time while court is in session each day.

By contrast, the Fulton County trial will be broadcast on YouTube, so Trump will appear on camera virtually every moment of the trial -- a situation that will present its own challenges as Trump, the TV president, no doubt will seek to generate made-for-TV moments.","{'uri': 'politico.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'POLITICO'}",[],https://static.politico.com/bd/33/5952f51c4d7db89511f4dcf04816/trump-fraud-trial-51883.jpg,eng-9040490,-0.4588235294117647,4,4,POLITICO,politico.com

Donald Trump is scheduled to give evidence on Monday in the case, which comes as he leads Republican 2024 presidential hopefuls and fights four separate criminal cases.

The unrelated civil case, brought by New York attorney general Letitia James, accuses him, his company and executives of deceiving banks and insurers by exaggerating his wealth on his annual financial statements.

He and the other defendants, including sons Eric and Donald Jr, deny the allegations.

Outside court on Friday, Eric Trump told reporters: ""We're going to win this thing. I promise you we're going to win it because we haven't done a damn thing wrong.""

He and his older brother are executive vice presidents of the Trump Organisation, and became trustees of a trust set up to run the company when their father went to the White House.

The sons signed, for example, yearly letters that certified their father's financial wherewithal to lender Deutsche Bank. Echoing evidence from Donald Trump Jr earlier this week, Eric Trump said he trusted company finance executives and an outside accounting firm to ensure the information was correct.

""I would not sign something that was not accurate,"" he said during his second day in the witness box.

""I relied on one of the biggest accounting firms in the country. And I relied on a great legal team. And when they gave me comfort that the statement was perfect, I was more than happy to execute.""

He said he did not dig into the details of his father's ""statement of financial condition"". Ms James's office says the documents contained grossly inflated values for assets ranging from Trump Tower in New York to the Mar-a-Lago club in Palm Beach, Florida.

Emails shown in court indicate that Eric Trump was asked for information to help complete the statement in 2013, and another Trump Organisation executive has told the court that the younger Trump was on a video call about the document as recently as 2021. Eric Trump reiterated on Friday that he had no memory of the call.

""I get thousands of calls,"" he said, saying he picks up his phone at 5am each day and puts it down at midnight.

Speaking to reporters outside the courtroom, he called the case a ""charade"" and a waste of taxpayers' money. Echoing his father, he also cast the case as a political ""witch hunt.""

Meanwhile, lawyers for the ex-president, his sons and their company again pressed allegations that Judge Arthur Engoron is being improperly influenced by his principal law clerk.

Judge Engoron strongly denied the claims and, as he had a day earlier, told the lawyers not to broach the matter again.

Judge Arthur Engoron (Jeenah Moon/AP)

Ms James and Judge Engoron are Democrats, and his principal law clerk, Allison Greenfield, ran as a Democrat for a civil court judgeship last year.

A Trump social media post disparaging Ms Greenfield a month ago spurred a partial gagging order that bans parties to the trial from commenting publicly on the judge's staff. Fines followed, after Judge Engoron said the ex-president violated the order.

Meanwhile, Trump's lawyers have repeatedly complained in court about the clerk's notes to the judge during evidence.

The contents of the notes have not been disclosed, but the lawyers argue that the messages indicate possible bias against their case.

Judge Engoron insists he has an ""absolute, unfettered right"" to input from his clerk, and that he does not see how such advice is a sign of bias. He told the defence on Thursday that he might expand the gag order to include lawyers if anyone refers to a member of his staff again.","{'uri': 'dailymail.co.uk', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'Daily Mail Online'}",[],https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2023/11/03/19/wire-77380067-1699041126-565_636x382.jpg,eng-9031235,-0.05098039215686279,4,4,Daily Mail Online,dailymail.co.uk

The closer one looks, the less sense this makes.

Donald Trump's third criminal indictment was, by some measures, the one much of the political world was waiting for. On August 1, a federal grand jury in Washington, D.C. returned a four-count indictment charging the former president with trying to overturn the 2020 presidential election and subvert lawful votes.

There was no shortage of questions surrounding the case, but near the top of the list was an unavoidable line of inquiry: What kind of defense would we see from the Republican and his attorneys?

The answer continues to come into focus, and it's not an especially pretty one. The New York Times reported:

The Times' report was certainly polite. Describing Team Trump's arguments as straining ""the boundaries of credulity"" seemed like a generous way of saying the arguments were plainly foolish.

But putting courtesies aside, the latest court filings suggest that the former president and his defense counsel have thrown everything they could possibly think of -- without regard for shame -- in the hopes that something, anything, might stick.

Most of the claims were familiar. Team Trump argued that the charges are politically motivated, despite the lack of evidence to bolster the allegations. The filings also pushed a clumsy First Amendment argument, claiming that the Republican's lies were, and are, protected speech.

But there was one element of the filings that stood out for me. Times reported:

""The United States Senate has previously tried and acquitted President Trump for charges arising from the same course of conduct alleged in the indictment, the impeachment and double jeopardy clauses both bar retrial before this Court and require dismissal,"" the filing argued.

I can appreciate the temptation to throw the proverbial kitchen sink into court filings, but this is genuinely laughable.

Revisiting our earlier coverage, Trump was impeached by a bipartisan majority in the House in early 2021. His case went to the Senate, where a bipartisan majority voted to convict. One Senate Republican conceded, independent of the political impeachment process, that she believed Trump's actions were ""unlawful.""

Meanwhile, Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell, after the Senate ""trial,"" delivered remarks on the chamber floor about Trump's legal liabilities. ""President Trump is still liable for everything he did while he was in office, as an ordinary citizen,"" McConnell said, adding, ""He didn't get away with anything yet -- yet. We have a criminal justice system in this country. We have civil litigation. And former presidents are not immune from being accountable by either one.""

McConnell made this argument in part because the Senate proceedings weren't an actual trial. There was no courtroom. The process did not follow the rules of criminal procedure. The ""jurors"" were seen routinely communicating with those representing the ""defendant.""

What's more, as my MSNBC colleague Hayes Brown noted, Team Trump tried this gambit before, and it didn't work.

If the former president is counting on the ""double jeopardy"" argument to help get him out of trouble, he probably ought to start lowering his expectations.","{'uri': 'msnbc.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'MSNBC.com'}",[],"https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_nbcnews-fp-1024-512,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2023-10/231025-donald-trump-al-1027-da5834.jpg",eng-9003452,-0.07450980392156858,4,4,MSNBC.com,msnbc.com

Goldfeder will join Cozen next month as special counsel alongside commercial litigation member Kerry Cooperman in New York. Goldfeder and Cooperman are the latest former Stroock & Stroock & Lavan lawyers to land at a new firm as Stroock plans to dissolve.

Prior to joining Stroock, Goldfeder was special counsel for public integrity to then-New York attorney general Andrew Cuomo, a Democrat. He also currently directs a voting rights and democracy initiative at Fordham University School of Law, where he is an adjunct professor.

He has been on legal teams for John Kerry, Dick Gephardt, Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton, Pete Buttigieg and Joe Biden, according to a Cozen spokesperson.

""I have every expectation that we will be very busy,"" Goldfeder said of the new practice at Cozen, where he will continue representing elected officials and candidates. He anticipates work related to the 2024 presidential election, congressional and state legislature elections.

Goldfeder will also be part of Philadelphia-founded Cozen's commercial litigation practice and work with its government relations arm, the firm said.

""Legal disputes have long been a part of U.S. politics and Jerry brings an astonishing four decade track record of successfully advising and representing political clients on the federal, state, and local levels,"" Michael Heller, Cozen O'Connor's executive chairman and CEO, said in a statement.

Heller also said that Cooperman ""brings an equally diverse and successful track record"" to the firm.

Cooperman, who was director of Stroock's pro bono program, represents real estate and other clients in litigation and regulatory matters, and advises non-profit and tax-exempt organizations. He said Cozen stood out due to its strengths in his practice areas and commitment to pro bono legal service.

Stroock declined to comment.

Partners at Stroock, one of New York's oldest law firms, voted to take steps to dissolve late last month, amid mounting departures and a failure to secure a merger after discussions with larger firms. Since then, Stroock lawyers have found new homes at several firms including Crowell & Moring, Hogan Lovells, Steptoe & Johnson, Squire Patton Boggs and Thompson Coburn.

Retailer chatbot lawsuits rely on California Cold-War wiretap law,"Nov 2 (Reuters) - Illegal wiretapping might evoke images of Cold War spies bugging rotary-dial phones - but what about a retailer's chatbot telling customers how to return a sweater?

In a flood of new litigation, plaintiffs' lawyers are attempting to stretch a half-century-old California law that bans unauthorized wiretapping to cover this seemingly innocuous form of online customer support.

Millions of dollars may be on the line.

Plaintiffs' lawyers argue that when companies on their websites use live or automated pop-up chat boxes (""Hi! I'm here to help you find answers as quickly as possible. Please type your question below.""), they may run afoul of the California Invasion of Privacy Act. The 1967 law makes it illegal to covertly eavesdrop or record telephone conversations and includes a private right of action, with the potential for statutory damages of $5,000 per violation.

""It adds up really quickly,"" Harrison Brown, a business litigation partner at Blank Rome who has been following the litigation, told me. ""The plaintiffs' bar has gotten very creative.""

At least 100 lawsuits aspiring to class action status have been filed in recent months in California state and federal courts against targets including Home Depot (HD.N), Ford Motor Co (F.N) and Old Navy. Defense lawyers tell me many more demand letters threatening suit have been sent.

Similar litigation is also underway, albeit less pervasive, based on state laws elsewhere, including in Florida and Pennsylvania, according to a business litigation report by Quinn Emanuel Urquhart & Sullivan.

Are the claims legitimate? Or is this ""gotcha"" litigation, with plaintiffs' lawyers filing cookie-cutter complaints in the hopes of getting quick settlements?

The answer may be both.

There's no question online privacy is a serious concern. Plaintiffs' lawyers point to findings by the Electronic Privacy Information Center that show consistent support among Americans for stronger privacy laws, with nearly 9 in 10 adults saying they are ""very concerned"" about data privacy.

The chatbot lawsuits ""are intended to vindicate important privacy rights"" that are ""too frequently ignored,"" Scott Ferrell of Newport Beach, California-based Pacific Trial Attorneys told me in an emailed statement.

According to U.S. District Judge Jesus Bernal in Riverside, California, Ferrell has filed at least 88 such lawsuits, evincing what the judge in dismissing litigation against clothing chain Hot Topic called ""an unmistakable intent to sue as many companies as possible in the shortest amount of time possible.""

While Bernal, a President Barack Obama appointee, tossed the suit against Hot Topic for failing to establish subject matter jurisdiction, other judges (including Judge Sunshine Sykes in the courtroom next door) have allowed nearly identical cases to survive the initial pleading stage and move into discovery.

Bolstering the claims is an unpublished, six-page decision in May 2022 by the San Francisco-based 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals that dealt with a seemingly narrow issue.

The plaintiff in Javier v. Assurance IQ filled out an online questionnaire to get a life insurance quote, allegedly unaware that the company was recording all his interactions with its website. The problem was, Florentino Javier consented to Assurance's privacy policy only after he'd inputted his confidential information, when he clicked ""View my quote.""

In a 2-1 decision, the panel reversed the lower court's decision to dismiss the case, ruling that such retroactive consent wasn't sufficient. The appeals court didn't address Assurance's other defenses, and the case on remand was subsequently dismissed with prejudice on different grounds.

But the decision also included this nugget: that California's invasion of privacy law, while ""written in terms of wiretapping,"" also ""applies to Internet communications,"" and it makes liable anyone who accesses such communication ""without the consent of all parties.""

Bingo.

A handful of plaintiffs' lawyers quickly applied the holding to chatbot interactions where customers were not warned up front that the company may record the conversation or use a third-party chat software vendor to do so.

""When I first learned about this, I thought chatbots were so innocuous, who cares?"" Tauler Smith co-founder Robert Tauler, who has filed multiple lawsuits, told me. ""But the technology is staggering,"" he said, calling it ""a feast of data"" that can be exploited for commercial gain.

Perhaps. Still, I wonder how valuable a query such as, ""What are your store hours?"" might be to data analysts.

As the cases progress, one unsettled question is whether consumers interacting with chatbots actually think their conversations are private.

""You know it's a robot. Do you really have an expectation of privacy?"" said Matthew Kenefick, a litigation partner at Jeffer Mangels Butler & Mitchell in San Francisco who represents clients facing chatbot privacy claims.

""Most businesses that use chatbots are looking to provide customer service,"" Kenefick said, sparing people who contact them from being placed on hold or waiting for an email response. Chatbots ""are not some nefarious scheme"" to siphon confidential information, he told me.

As courts begin to dig into the merits of the claims (which are brought under two specific privacy act provisions, sections 631(a) and 632.7), the role of the third-party vendors that website owners use to run their chatbots will be key.

Courts in California have held that parties cannot eavesdrop on themselves (because duh), but plaintiffs argue that allowing third-party operators to collect and transmit chatbot conversations without providing disclosures makes the website owners liable under the privacy law.

The Retail Litigation Center in a friend of the court brief vigorously disputes this contention. The privacy law's prohibition on third-party eavesdropping ""plainly does not apply when customers voluntarily send written messages to a retailer through a website's chat functions and the retailer receives and retains the messages,"" the trade organization argues.

Retail Litigation Center counsel Craig Cardon, a partner at Sheppard, Mullin, Richter & Hampton, told me that right now, one of the most challenging things for businesses (and their lawyers) is not knowing if or how the privacy law may apply, given the lack of appellate review beyond the not-quite-on-point Javier decision.

Backlash was swift. More than 200 alumni signed an open letter to the law school's dean, Erwin Chemerinsky, urging him to ""publicly address the harm"" done by the article and to uphold freedom of speech for all students.

In an email to the Berkeley Law community, Chemerinsky affirmed the school's commitment to freedom of speech, including language that ""others find offensive, even deeply offensive."" He also noted that the professor was expressing a personal opinion and did not speak for the law school.

Then last weekend, Chemerinsky, a constitutional law scholar who is Jewish, published an op-ed of his own in the Los Angeles Times. He described antisemitic remarks directed at him since the war started, as well as statements from students and academics around the country that he said ""celebrated the Hamas terrorist attack.""

""There has been enough silence and enough tolerance of antisemitism on college campuses,"" he wrote. ""I call on my fellow university administrators to speak out and denounce the celebrations of Hamas and the blatant antisemitism that is being voiced.""

Even before Hamas' brutal Oct. 7 incursion into Israel, the Israeli-Palestinian issue had been a painful source of conflict on college campuses. The escalating war, including relentless Israeli airstrikes and a ground invasion of Gaza, has turned U.S. universities into battlegrounds over speech and the potential consequences of airing opinions that some regard as hateful.

More than 1,400 people have died on the Israeli side, mainly civilians killed during Hamas' initial attack, and Palestinian militants are holding about 220 people hostage.

More than 9,000 Palestinians have been killed in the war, mostly women and children, according to the Hamas-run Gaza Health Ministry. More than 1.4 million have fled their homes.

At Berkeley Law, the inflammatory Wall Street Journal op-ed by Steven Davidoff Solomon, an expert on corporate law and an advisor to the Jewish law students association, has had a chilling effect, say some students who advocate for Palestinian rights.

""Many feel uncomfortable speaking out beyond their private social media accounts,"" said Matt Fernandes, a third-year law student and member of the Berkeley chapter of Law Students for Justice in Palestine. ""Everyone's scared. Everyone's fearful. Everyone feels angry and betrayed by our own faculty.""

In the op-ed, Solomon recommended against hiring his own students if they ""advocate hate and practice discrimination.""

He referenced a bylaw that the Berkeley chapter of Law Students for Justice in Palestine had adopted the previous academic year vowing not to ""invite speakers that have expressed and continued to hold views or host/sponsor/promote events in support of Zionism, the apartheid state of Israel, and the occupation of Palestine."" Eight other campus organizations signed on to variations of the bylaw, which critics slammed as silencing Jewish students.

""If you are a legal employer, when you interview students from Berkeley, Harvard, NYU or any other law school this year, ask them what organizations they belong to,"" Solomon wrote. ""Ask if they support discriminatory bylaws or other acts and resolutions blaming Jews and Israelis for the Hamas massacre. If a student endorses hatred, it isn't only your right but your duty not to hire him.""

Last month, a New York law firm rescinded a job offer to an NYU Law student who had written what the firm described as ""inflammatory comments"" about the Hamas attack. Another law firm initially rescinded offers to Harvard and Columbia students for similar reasons.

The New York Times reported that about two dozen Wall Street law firms signed a letter to law schools cautioning that students hoping to be hired should be prepared to work under ""zero tolerance policies for any form of discrimination or harassment, much less the kind that has been taking place on some law school campuses.""

Fernandes said he feels that Solomon directly targeted marginalized students because most of the organizations that adopted the bylaw, some of which were named in the op-ed, represent students of color and queer students. Many of Fernandes' peers are worried that by expressing support for the Palestinians, they could jeopardize their law careers or face online abuse.

During the bylaw controversy, students associated with Law Students for Justice in Palestine were doxxed and deluged with hate mail, Fernandes said.

At one point, a truck circled the campus displaying billboards that named several students, including Fernandes, and declared them part of ""Berkeley Law's Antisemitic Class of 2023.""

Solomon did not respond to requests seeking comment.

After Solomon's op-ed was published on Oct. 15, Liz Jackson's phone lit up with messages from fellow Berkeley Law alumni.

Jackson is Jewish and a founding attorney with Palestine Legal, which defends the rights of people who speak in support of Palestinian freedom.

""The content of his op-ed went around like wildfire,"" she recalled. ""It was shocking and racist, and very offensive to myself as a Jewish alumni and ... students of all backgrounds who identify with Palestinians.""

To Jackson, the opinion piece read as a call to punish law students who advocate for Palestinian rights, many of them students of color who already face barriers to employment.

With other alumni, she began organizing the open letter to Chemerinsky, which, in addition to urging the dean to speak out, accused Solomon of violating the university's free-speech values by threatening the safety and livelihoods of students based on their political opinions. And, the letter said, Solomon conflated ""support for the Palestinian people or criticism of the Israeli government with antisemitism.""

Asked in an interview on Monday if he thought Solomon's op-ed was harmful to students, Chemerinsky said, ""What else can I say other than -- that isn't the law school's position, and we'll help every student find a job?""

Some law students said they largely agreed with Solomon.

Jacob Shofet, a first-year student who is Jewish, said law firms have the right to choose their employees.

""Everyone has a right to free speech. And law firms are free to hire who they want to hire,"" he said. ""At the same time, I think organizations on campus, both in the law school and UC Berkeley itself, have blurred the line between legitimate Palestinian issues and rights, and a support for terrorism that wants to see me dead.""

Charlotte Aaron said that as a Jewish student she has felt increasingly unsafe on campus since the war started.

Last week, Aaron said she retreated to her home in Arizona for a few days after watching some of her law school peers join hundreds of other students in a pro-Palestinian protest on campus, chanting phrases such as ""smash the Zionist settler state."" The walkout was part of a national protest calling for Israel to end its siege of Gaza.

At Cornell University, violent threats against Jewish students prompted campus police to increase security at the Center for Jewish Living last week.

""Employers have an obligation to consider this moral failing,"" said Aaron, a third-year student. ""I wouldn't want any person who justifies the murders of Oct. 7 and the holding of hostages to be my lawyer. I am deeply concerned about these individuals being in positions of power one day.""

After initially taking no action, Chemerinsky emailed editors of campus law journals on Oct. 23, informing them that students can no longer receive academic credit for working on a journal that has adopted the bylaw.

In his Oct. 29 op-ed, Chemerinsky noted that he strongly opposes ""the policies of the Netanyahu government,"" favors ""full rights for Palestinians"" and believes ""that there must be a two-state solution.""

But, he wrote, he can no longer stay silent when some people on college campuses are ""calling for an end to Israel.""

Aaron said she approves of Chemerinsky's willingness to condemn antisemitism and feels ""lucky"" to attend a school he leads.

But some alumni criticized Chemerinsky's op-ed for failing to also condemn anti-Palestinian racism that students are experiencing. Jackson said she was alarmed that Chemerinsky would use his platform to ""center his own personal discomfort"" when ""we're watching a genocide committed in the name of Jewish safety.""

She said Chemerinsky ""smeared his own students"" and ascribed a level of hate to them ""that essentially is the same thing as the Solomon op-ed, but a little lighter.""","{'uri': 'latimes.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'Los Angeles Times'}",[],https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/ef10ce2/2147483647/strip/true/crop/4794x2697+0+73/resize/1200x675!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F56%2F49%2F6895d5dd4c42b2420aab46e43b50%2F1300606-me-uc-berkeley01-je.jpg,,-0.1372549019607843,76,76,Los Angeles Times,latimes.com

Membrillera, who led Paul Weiss' London office, works with private equity firms and their portfolio companies on M&A and leveraged finance deals.

He has advised clients including KKR, General Atlantic, BC Partners and KPS Capital Partners, according to his Paul Weiss online biography.

Membrillera joined Paul Weiss in 2017 from Simpson Thacher & Bartlett. Paul Weiss opened its London outpost in 2001.

The firm's website lists three partners and two counsel who remain in the office. It lost two other London partners, M&A and private equity lawyers Ramy Wahbeh and Kaisa Kuusk, to U.S. competitor Sidley Austin earlier this summer.

Wahbeh, who was deputy head of Paul Weiss' London office, is now co-leader of Sidley's private equity practice group.

A Paul Weiss spokesperson did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Membrillera's departure.

Kirkland's London office, which opened in 1994, has more than 300 lawyers, according to its website. The Chicago-founded firm has about 3,500 lawyers globally.

""Alvaro is one of Europe's top private equity lawyers with substantial experience leading complex cross-border transactions for sophisticated financial sponsors,"" Jon Ballis, chairman of Kirkland's executive committee, said in a statement.

Kirkland has made at least one other London partner hire this year.

CNN --

Capped off by Ivanka Trump's testimony Wednesday, the civil trial over the fate of the Trump Organization has brought its share of star power to a Manhattan courtroom. Still, the allegations in the case are far less splashy than others in which the former president is currently a defendant.

For instance, in a federal case in Washington, DC, former President Donald Trump faces allegations of subverting the 2020 election; a second election subversion case has been brought by the district attorney in Fulton County, Georgia; a federal case in south Florida alleges mishandling of sensitive government documents at Mar-a-Lago; a case brought by the district attorney in Manhattan alleges that Trump falsified business records in order to conceal extramarital affairs; and a civil defamation suit in New York federal court involves statements Trump made in 2019 about a sexual assault. (Trump denies wrongdoing in all of these cases.)

In contrast, the central issue in the current trial, initiated by New York State Attorney General Letitia James, is a straightforward question of corporate law: did a real estate entity improperly inflate the values of properties in appraisals in order to secure favorable loan and tax treatment? Despite fireworks from Trump and two of his sons on the witness stand earlier in the trial, the case is as uncontroversial (or, dare I say, boring) as they come.

A major issue isn't even being considered at trial, as the judge overseeing it has already ruled that the Trump Organization engaged in ""persistent and repeated"" fraud. (The ruling came in a ""summary judgment"" order, a type of ruling typically issued before a trial that allows a court to resolve issues it deems to be so clear on their face as to not be in legal dispute).

At this point, the court is primarily weighing what damages and penalties the Trump Organization will face as a result. As she is not a defendant in the case and left the Trump Organization in 2017 for a role in the White House, Ivanka Trump's testimony is hardly pivotal.

But the question of what penalty the Trump Organization will pay is surprisingly crucial to Donald Trump's future. The case could carry seismic consequences a casual observer might overlook: the organization's loss of any meaningful ability to do business in New York. In a way, it could end up being far more significant to Trump than any financial penalties or going to prison might.

For background, an entity can't do business in New York (as elsewhere) without a certificate filed with the state. The cancellation of that certificate, for any reason, could have a devastating effect on a company, possibly imperiling its right to exist.

Earlier in the case, the judge granted a request from the attorney general to cancel several of the Trump organization's state business certificates. Trump successfully obtained a stay of the decision on appeal, and it is on hold while the case plays out.

If the certificates are canceled, a number of major Trump assets, including Trump Tower in Manhattan, would be taken over by a court-appointed receiver. That individual, who would function like an executor of an estate, would have the power to manage and sell Trump properties to pay off legal bills and creditors. Notably, absent from the process of managing the company would be Donald Trump himself.

It may be a weedy aspect of state corporate law unknown to many, but it could do far more irreparable harm to Trump than many other potential sanctions he faces. For instance, the full financial penalty of $250 million the attorney general seeks from the Trump Organization seems less-than-eye popping when considered against Trump's net worth, estimated to be in the ballpark of $3 billion.

While $250 million tops the gross domestic product of some countries, it is, in effect, a drop in the bucket for one of the richest men on the planet. Consider that the $15,000 in fines Trump was ordered to pay for twice violating a gag order in the case would have wiped many American families out; they were a rounding error for Trump, who paid them off almost immediately. There is no deterrent or punitive effect of fines and fees that are of no consequence to the person paying them.

Even the growing threat of significant prison time Trump may be facing in other cases doesn't necessarily provide the accountability that it might for most other defendants in American criminal history.

As a former prosecutor, I will acknowledge that even under the most charitable of circumstances, prison robs people of almost everything -- their liberty, their dignity, their humanity. However, the one thing prison doesn't rob people of is the ability to run for, and perhaps even serve as, president of the United States (historians will remember that in 1920, Eugene V. Debs got nearly a million votes for president from behind bars).

Certainly, there is some measure of justice when a defendant is convicted following fair, public legal proceedings and sentenced in accordance with the law. But does any of it actually matter if that defendant can simultaneously serve as leader of the free world? With polling consistently indicating that wide segments of the voting population are unconcerned with the cloud of legal allegations hanging over Trump, it's a reasonable question to ask.

On the other hand, while largely losing the ability to do business in New York may appear to be a slap on the wrist, it will be devastating for Trump, his brand and his businesses.

People are free to disregard a candidate's criminal history, or even to deny the results of an election. However, they can't do business with an entity that effectively no longer exists. Trump the business came long before Trump the president. Losing that would be cataclysmic for Trump on every level. No amount of bluster on the campaign trail can change that.

The arcana of business certificates and corporate structure may not gain as much attention from the public as allegations of sexual assault in department stores, dalliances with porn stars, phone calls to state election officials , sensitive documents stored in gold-plated bathrooms, or insurrections might.

However, for a major business run by a former president, they may end up providing an existential measure of accountability that most fines or getting locked up will not.","{'uri': 'cnn.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'CNN'}",[],"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/2023-11-06t175126z-1600457197-rc2i74a7ub6f-rtrmadp-3-usa-trump-subversion.JPG?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill",eng-9040490,-0.05882352941176472,55,55,CNN,cnn.com

""I understand this sounds ridiculous, at least at first glance,"" said Kammer, a self-avowed Swiftie. ""But it's not.""

Kammer's course, The Taylor Swift Effect, planned for the spring semester looks to be the first law school class based on the sequined musical icon.

After attending a Swift concert in Minneapolis in June, Kammer said he was inspired to develop the writing-intensive class, available to second- and third-year law students. The course will look at the musician's interactions with the law, such as her rerecording of six albums and related copyright issue, Kammer said. It will also examine how individuals' own experiences and beliefs shape how they interpret the law -- much like how they interpret her song lyrics.

Pop culture-focused law classes are not uncommon, and they can create a public relations buzz for the schools that offer them. The gritty television show ""The Wire"" inspired a number of criminal law-focused classes over the years, and the University of Virginia School of Law in 2022 offered a class on corporate law based on the show ""Succession.""

Law classes centered on a single public figure are harder to come by, though Georgia State University College of Law is currently running a class based on the legal life of rapper and music executive Rick Ross.

Boston University law professor Jessica Silbey, who co-authored a textbook on pop culture and the law, said students tend to be more engaged when they study subjects such as sports, new technology and celebrities.

Silbey covers the singer's album rerecordings in her copyright class to teach about contract law in the music business. She said Swift's success story and her bumps along the way provide opportunity for lessons in the law.

South Dakota Law isn't the first academic institution to tap into the Swift sensation. The University of California at Berkeley this week announced an upcoming business course based on Swift's entrepreneurship. Stanford, New York University and the University of Texas have also offered Swift-inspired classes. But Kammer's course is the first legal exploration of her music and career.

Kammer, who also teaches legal history, said he plans to use certain songs to delve into the interpretation of lyrics and legal texts, and into the benefits and drawbacks of approaches such as originalism, evolutionism, and textualism.

""If we have students who are passionate about Taylor Swift -- and we do -- I thought that could be a useful lens to get them excited about certain topics they might not normally be interested in,"" Kammer said.

The 11 nominees contrasted sharply with those appointed by former President Trump, who were overwhelmingly white men.

All three of Biden's initial nominees to the federal appeals courts, the second-highest tier in the judicial system, are Black women. The nominees for federal district court posts include people who, if confirmed, would become the first Muslim federal judge and the first woman of color to serve on the federal bench in Maryland, the White House said. Four of the 11 are of Asian or Pacific Islander descent.

The nominees are the first of what the White House expects will be a ""steady drumbeat"" of judicial nominations this year, said a senior White House official who briefed reporters on the nominations.

In a statement, Biden referred to his picks as a ""trailblazing slate of nominees"" drawn from ""the very best and brightest minds of the American legal profession.""

""Each is deeply qualified and prepared to deliver justice faithfully under our Constitution and impartially to the American people -- and together they represent the broad diversity of background, experience and perspective that makes our nation strong,"" he said.

The Biden nominee likely to attract the most attention, especially in the Senate, which will consider their confirmations this spring, is Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson, currently a federal district judge in Washington, D.C. Biden has nominated her to serve on the D.C. Circuit federal court of appeals. That court is often tagged as the second-most influential in the country because of the many high-profile government-related cases that land on its docket.

More pertinent in Jackson's case, it has often served as a springboard for the Supreme Court. Three of the current nine justices -- Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr., and Justices Clarence Thomas and Brett M. Kavanaugh, served on the D.C. Circuit before being nominated to the Supreme Court. So did the late Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Antonin Scalia.

Jackson, a well-regarded district judge, has often been mentioned as a potential Supreme Court nominee in a Democratic administration. That speculation heightened during the presidential campaign when Biden promised to name a Black woman to the high court.

White House officials were quick to note that naming 11 judicial nominees by the end of March put Biden ahead of the pace set by his predecessors. White House Chief of Staff Ron Klain tweeted Tuesday morning that in their first 100 days, President Obama made three nominations and Trump two, while neither President Clinton nor President George W. Bush made any. Biden was at ""11, with 30+ days to go,"" Klain wrote.

The president served 17 years as chairman or the ranking Democrat on the Senate Judiciary Committee, which handles judicial nominations, giving him extensive experience with the process, the senior White House official noted; Klain for a time was the committee's chief counsel.

In addition to racial and ethnic diversity, Biden has been keen to break away from the pattern of judges being drawn disproportionately from a small range of professional backgrounds -- especially former prosecutors and partners at large corporate law firms, the senior official noted. Four of the current nominees, including Jackson, worked as public defenders, who represent those who cannot afford to pay for their own lawyers.

""Public defenders, in particular, occupy a critical space in our judicial system,"" the official said, speaking under ground rules that don't allow use of names. ""Our criminal justice system can't function without talented individuals on both sides,"" the official said, and having them as judges ""is as important as having individuals who represented the government."" Lawyers who have handled civil rights cases are also a priority, the official said.

During Trump's four years, Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky led a concerted drive to fill every available judicial vacancy with conservative nominees, often relatively young judges whose lifetime appointments to the bench could last decades. Trump ended up naming 234 federal judges, including 54 to the courts of appeals, the second most in a four-year term. Partly as a result, several appeals courts now have strong conservative majorities.

Democratic activists have been eager for Biden to begin quickly making his own appointments to redress what they see as an improper skew in the judiciary. Many of them fretted during both Obama's and Clinton's tenures that judicial vacancies were too low a priority.

Biden's moves drew praise from activist groups. It's ""a welcome shift to see this level of prioritization of judges,"" said Brian Fallon, the executive director of Demand Justice, which was formed to press for progressive judges. Jackson ""and the other public defenders and civil rights lawyers in this group are exactly the kind of judges we need to rebalance our courts,"" he said in a statement.

Because many judges appointed by Democrats held off on retiring while Trump was in office, Biden currently has 72 vacancies to fill, and an additional 28 judges have indicated they plan to step down this year. Several of the appeals courts, however, almost certainly will retain a conservative majority well into the next presidential term.

The pace of district court nominations depends heavily on senators. The White House largely defers to Democratic senators' recommendations for vacancies in their states. California currently has 18 federal judicial vacancies.

On the Supreme Court, where Republican appointees have a 6-3 majority, Biden's first chance to fill a seat could come if Justice Stephen G. Breyer, 82, steps down. It's widely expected that he likely will do so either at the end of the current term, in June, or next year to ensure that Biden can appoint his successor while Democrats control the Senate.

Many Democratic activists were devastated last year when Ginsburg's death weeks before the election allowed Trump to name her replacement, Justice Amy Coney Barrett, and a Republican-controlled Senate quickly confirmed her.

Breyer, a politically experienced justice who worked for seven years earlier in his career as a top aide to Sen. Edward M. Kennedy of Massachusetts on the Judiciary Committee, and was appointed in 1994 by President Clinton, is unlikely to let a similar scenario play out in his case.

Jackson worked as a law clerk to Breyer after graduating from law school, part of a resume that fits what is, at this point, the standard profile of a Supreme Court justice -- graduation from an elite law school (Harvard in her case), judicial clerkships, and, if confirmed now, prior service on an appeals court. She also served as vice chair of the U.S. Sentencing Commission and has won praise in legal circles for the quality of her written opinions.

Indeed, to the extent that some Democrats have voiced reservations about Jackson's potential candidacy, the argument has ironically been that she has too many traditional qualifications. Some Democrats, including Biden's ally Rep. James E. Clyburn of South Carolina, have suggested the president should look for a nominee who would break the mold of Ivy League graduates into which almost all the current justices fit.

Biden's other two appeals court nominees were Candace Jackson-Akiwumi, a litigator and former federal public defender in Chicago, for the 7th Circuit, based in that city, and Tiffany Cunningham, for the Federal Circuit, which handles claims against the government. The 7th Circuit has not had a Black judge since 2017; Trump appointed four white judges to fill vacancies on it.

In addition to the three appeals court nominees, the slate includes nominees for federal district court judgeships in New Mexico, Colorado, Maryland, New Jersey and D.C., and a nominee for the D.C. Superior Court, the local trial bench in Washington.","{'uri': 'latimes.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'Los Angeles Times'}",[],https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/0919d7b/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3375x1898+0+176/resize/1200x675!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Ff0%2F56%2F4919d64a4a1b9047f9b9077081b4%2Fbiden-82377.jpg,eng-9029051,0.1215686274509804,30,30,Los Angeles Times,latimes.com

A South Dakota law professor typically teaches about dense topics like torts and natural resources. But next semester, he and his fearless students are shaking things up by turning their attention to Taylor Swift.

Sean Kammer wanted his legal writing course to draw on music and art to help his students reconsider legal language and craft persuasive arguments. The self-described ""Swiftie"" thought a focus on the cultural icon was also a way to connect with his students.

Never in his wildest dreams did Kammer expect the attention that the announcement generated -- the class filled up quickly and jealous alumni even reached out.

""The reaction from students has been exciting,"" he said. ""If we can have fun while we're exploring some of these complex theoretical problems or issues, I believe students will be inspired to think deeper and to push themselves further.""

Swifties at the University of South Dakota Knudson School of Law aren't the only ones having fun. Law professors across the country are increasingly drawing on popular culture and celebritydom -- sometimes with the help of celebrities themselves -- to engage a new generation of students and contextualize complicated concepts in the real world.

Courses on Swift, Rick Ross and Succession supplement traditional law school courses with fun and accessible experiences that professors say they often didn't have themselves.

Students at the Georgia State University College of Law were hustlin' everyday to get to class -- especially on Tuesday when they got to hear directly from Ross for the final day of a course that chronicled the legal intricacies of the rapper, record executive and Wingstop franchise owner's life.

Moraima ""Mo"" Ivory, director of the school's entertainment, sports and media law program, wants her students to see for themselves what goes into the albums, television shows and movies they enjoy. She chooses a star each year and invites guest speakers from their world, along with the title character themselves, to bring legal deals, defenses and drama to life.

""We're talking about critical legal principles, but we're watching them as they happen and as they happened,"" she said. ""It really just turns that lightbulb on for law students.""

Ivory said she could've heard a pin drop in one class about mixtapes that featured guest DJ Drama.

""It was never my experience that I walked out of a law school classroom excited about what I had learned,"" Ivory said.

For third-year law student Luke Padia, the experience makes concepts feel more tangible than reading a textbook or case law, he said.

""No knock on the other courses,"" the 26-year-old from Lawrence, Kansas, said. ""I just find that my attention is more easily grabbed when I'm sitting in class listening to Steve Sadow talk about how he was able to get Rick Ross out of jail as opposed to sitting in constitutional law or torts or whatever it may be.""

Frances Acevedo, a 25-year-old from Pembroke Pines, Florida, in her third year of law school, said she's walked away from the class with an understanding of how important a team is to an artist's success -- a message Ross emphasized.

""I can sit at the table and talk money with multibillionaires,"" Ross said to students, faculty and guests gathered for the course finale. ""But when it's time for me to move forward, I sit down with my team.""

Courses on A-list celebrities have captivated undergraduate and graduate students across the country for years, increasingly in courses analyzing race and gender. The attention on female artists and artists of color is a sign of growing respect for them and for different modes of artistic expression, said Kinitra Brooks, an English professor at Michigan State University.

Brooks' course on Beyonce's Lemonade album and Black feminism was so popular that she published a reader that other professors can use. The pop culture material offers ""immediate relatability,"" which Brooks thinks makes students more likely to participate, allow their ideas to be challenged and be willing to challenge the artist, too.

Bella Andrade, a junior at Arizona State University, looks forward to her class on the psychology of Taylor Swift every week. The self-proclaimed ""huge Swiftie"" has been listening to her music for ""forever and a day,"" but the class includes a range of fans. There are ""10 out of 10"" Swifties, along with people who barely know her music, which ""leads to some really great conversations,"" she said.

""I think I've developed a much deeper understanding of different topics in social psychology,"" said Andrade, who is from Minneapolis. ""Taking topics that I've known about or heard about before but really applying them in a sense to something that I'm really invested in ... really solidifies meaning.""

The class investigated the show's prickly - and often duplicitous - legal matters, like hostile takeovers and securities law. Hwang said she was trying to engage and nurture a love of learning in students who ""grew up with different interactions with technology and pop culture than what I did.""

Wachtell, one of the most profitable U.S. law firms, appointed corporate partner Andrew Nussbaum and litigation partner William Savitt as co-chairs of its executive committee, the firm said in a Tuesday statement.

Herlihy and Neff will remain members of the committee, the firm said.

Wachtell was among the law firms that worked on AT&T's $43 billion deal last year to spin off its WarnerMedia unit and merge it with reality TV company Discovery. The firm's team, co-led by Nussbaum, advised an independent transaction committee from Discovery's board of directors.

Savitt, who co-leads Wachtell's litigation department, was among the lawyers hired by Twitter after Elon Musk balked at buying the social media platform now known as X for $44 billion in 2022. Musk has since sued Wachtell to recover $90 million in fees the firm was paid just as the deal closed last year. Wachtell has defended its work.

During their tenure as co-chairs, Herlihy and Neff maintained the firm's high profitability and elite reputation through a period of fierce competition by other U.S. law firms, like Kirkland & Ellis, that expanded their hold on big-ticket M&A and corporate litigation work.

Wachtell reported profits per equity partner averaging about $7.29 million in 2022, according to The American Lawyer. That put the firm behind only Kirkland's $7.52 million per equity partner.","{'uri': 'reuters.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'Reuters'}","[{'uri': 'sara_merken@reuters.com', 'name': 'Sara Merken', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': False}, {'uri': 'david_thomas@reuters.com', 'name': 'David Thomas', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': False}]",https://www.reuters.com/resizer/1KtRjXYs44za3KfQzrpBh-QKKW4=/728x381/smart/filters:quality(80)/cloudfront-us-east-2.images.arcpublishing.com/reuters/PLYZWZII2ZMOVFGPXXSIJQ5H6E.jpg,,0.1215686274509804,26,26,Reuters,reuters.com

The court will determine whether smokers who say they purchased cigarettes in response to deceptive ads can collectively sue the industry for the money they spent to smoke.

The court has grappled with the case for more than two years, trying to determine the reach of Proposition 64, a 2004 initiative intended to stop bogus lawsuits aimed at extorting money from small business. During the last several years, lower courts have tossed out many consumer class actions and scrutinized settlements more closely.

""Judges have started . . . wondering why there was a million dollars in attorneys fees and virtually nothing for the people who were supposedly defrauded,"" said Trent Norris, a San Francisco lawyer who defends corporations. ""California is part of a national trend.""

Nowhere was this skepticism more evident than in an order earlier this year by Los Angeles County Superior Court Judge Brett Klein.

Klein, asked to approve a class-action settlement, ordered the attorney who filed the suit to be paid the same way as consumers in the class, with $10 gift cards -- 12,500 of them -- to stores that sell prom dresses and other ware for teenage girls.

Klein's order came in a lawsuit charging that Windsor Fashion Store illegally required credit card users to provide their telephone numbers or e-mail or home addresses. Another judge overturned the order in February and awarded Yorba Linda lawyer Neil B. Fineman $125,000 in fees instead of gift cards.

Some advocates say beneficial consumer litigation is getting tossed along with the frivolous.

""The big picture is a broad assault on consumer protection laws by the defendants' lobby, with the growing support of the judicial branch,"" lamented Harvey Rosenfield, attorney for Consumer Watchdog, a nonprofit consumer advocacy group.

Proposition 64 amended the state's Unfair Competition Law to limit suits to people who have lost money or property.

Last month, an Alameda County judge, citing the measure's requirements, tossed out a class-action suit accusing Applebee's restaurants of misrepresenting the fat and nutrient content of lower-calorie meals. The judge said the consumers would have to show they had lost money -- a high bar given that the diet meals cost no more than the others.

Before Proposition 64, consumer, environmental and anti-poverty groups could sue over illegal practices even when no one lost money.

""We are looking at the death of . . . an enormously powerful consumer statute,"" said Sharon J. Arkin, a Los Angeles appellate lawyer for plaintiffs who bring the suits.

The tobacco case will determine whether class actions can be filed under the Unfair Competition Law. At issue is whether all members of the class must prove that the advertisements prompted them to buy cigarettes, a requirement that some attorneys said would doom the case.

The suit was brought on behalf of every Californian who was exposed to tobacco ads and bought cigarettes from 1998 to 2007. A similar suit in Michigan obtained a $10-billion jury award, Arkin said.

Lawyers for the smokers allege the tobacco industry misled people by suggesting that ""light"" or ""low-tar"" cigarettes were safer than other cigarettes. The suit also charges that the industry targeted minors.

Industry lawyers counter that the smokers were exposed to different ads and decided to smoke for different reasons, making a class action inappropriate. During oral argument, the state high court did not reveal how it was leaning.

The decision in the tobacco case may determine the outcome of several other pending cases. Most of the adverse rulings in consumer cases have come from a handful of state Courts of Appeal, primarily in San Diego and Orange counties, said class-action lawyer Timothy G. Blood of San Diego.

He cited a suit against Farmers Insurance Co. that said Farmers charged customers more money for paying monthly than for paying annually.

Although an appeals court found the practice violated the state insurance code and constituted a misdemeanor, it ruled that the people who sued had to show they would not have bought the policy if they had understood the different assessment, a requirement that some lawyers called an impossible legal challenge.

Another class action charged that Kwikset, a lock maker, violated the law by falsely claiming its products were made in the United States. A trial judge determined that the locks were substantially made outside the country, and the Federal Trade Commission made a similar finding and fined the company.

But the 4th District Court of Appeal, which has been a graveyard for similar suits, decided that the plaintiffs did not meet Proposition 64's requirements. No one claimed the locks didn't work.

Justice David G. Sills, presiding judge in the 4th District, called the Kwikset case ""precisely the sort of abuse that Proposition 64 was crafted to halt . . . lawsuits against businesses where lawyers make big bucks, and clients nothing, for finding some tiny, arguable technicality.""

Consumer advocates counter that the suits are based on laws. ""When people criticize these suits, they are really criticizing the law,"" Rosenfield said.

Class actions by nature usually yield more money to attorneys than to individuals in the class, Rosenfield said, noting that the system is designed for people whose losses are too small to make individual lawsuits worth bringing.

""We have hundreds of thousands of lawyers in California who, because they can make money on these cases, will bring them,"" said Arkin, past president of the Consumer Attorneys of California.

The climate for consumer class actions darkened as a result of scandals earlier in the decade when lawyers sued small businesses, such as auto shops and beauty shops, for minor code violations.

The lawyers pocketed the money the businesses paid to make the suits go away. Some later lost their law licenses.

""That burned through the legal community in a huge way, and people don't do that stuff anymore,"" Arkin said.

The imprisonment a year ago of William Lerach also drew wide attention to class-action abuses. The San Diego attorney paid people to be plaintiffs.

Other developments cited by lawyers were passage of a federal class-action law in 2005 and new state and federal guidelines that laid out ground rules for judges in such cases.

A state study of class actions from 2000 to 2006 showed that consumer suits have declined by 31% since 2002. Judges also threw out a higher portion of consumer class actions -- more than 24% -- than any other type.

The demise of what he calls frivolous suits has thrilled John H. Sullivan, president of the business-supported Civil Justice Assn. of California. He pointed to a ""fun"" ruling from the 4th District in a 2005 case against Starbucks.

The suit on behalf of 135,000 job applicants contended that the chain's job applications failed to clearly state that Californians were not required to report marijuana convictions more than two years old. Starbucks said the suit could cost it more than $27 million.

The three-judge panel scolded Starbucks and agreed that some Californians might have mistakenly believed they had to report pot convictions. But the panel tossed the suit on the grounds that none of the named plaintiffs had marijuana convictions.

""The civil justice system is not well served by turning Starbucks into a Daddy Warbucks,"" Justice Raymond J. Ikola wrote for the three-judge panel.

Class actions dumped by courts deserved it, said San Francisco corporate lawyer William Stern.

He cited a ""ridiculous"" lawsuit against the makers of Listerine for falsely advertising the mouthwash was as effective as flossing. In rejecting the suit, a Los Angeles-based appeals court said that Proposition 64 had ""dramatically"" restricted consumer protection measures and that the Listerine case illustrated ""the shortcomings of the initiative measure.""

The case is pending before the California Supreme Court, where Stern hopes it meets its demise.

""Society shouldn't redistribute income to gullible people,"" he said.

(CBS DETROIT) - It's been several months since the state's distracted driving law took effect over the summer.

Law enforcement in Oakland County said they are still seeing drivers using their phones while on the road.

""Some days people are obeying the law and not using their phones, and other days you can't go a mile without someone either manipulating their phone or having it in their hand because they can't put it down,"" said Deputy Chad Abbuhl with the Oakland County Sheriff's Department.

Abbuhl said the new law requires drivers to use their cell phones or other devices hands-free, but the law also extends beyond handheld devices.

""I've seen people doing makeup while they're driving, doing work presentations while they're driving, highlighting stuff and going over notes for work, have it all over the dashboard, that's also distracted driving,"" Abbuhl said.

Even if stopped at a red light or stop sign, drivers are still not allowed to have their cell phones in their hands.

""You're still in operation of the vehicle, and that's still considered distracted driving,"" Abbuhl said.

During a ride-along, Abbuhl observed several drivers with their devices in hand, including one woman who was seen texting at a red light. She was stopped and was given a warning. Surprisingly, she said she didn't know about the new law.

""So I explained to her what she did, and she said she was unaware of the cell phone, hands-free distracted driving law,"" Abbuhl said.

Abbuhl said the goal is not for law enforcement to write more tickets; the law is clearly designed to make our roads safer.

""There have been lives that have been lost because of it; we're just out here trying to educate people and let them know the dangers of using their phone while they are driving,"" Abbuhl said.","{'uri': 'cbsnews.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'CBS News'}",[],https://assets3.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2023/11/21/61fea0a9-3219-403c-b963-5fc14cf914c7/thumbnail/1200x630/8ae80c7bc832bcd62a715d6729159b4b/screenshot-2023-11-21-094116.png?v=5659e73acd91751548aa89950cf015b0,,-0.03529411764705881,25,25,CBS News,cbsnews.com

The Supreme Court said people working for Deliveroo couldn't be considered employees because they don't have specified hours, can work for rival companies, and can appoint someone to work in their place.

The arrangement between Deliveroo and its riders is ""fundamentally inconsistent with any notion of an employment relationship"", its judgment said.

Deliveroo riders had sought collective bargaining rights and the case was brought by the Independent Workers Union of Great Britain (IWGB).

They had tried to negotiate pay and conditions with the company, but were refused in 2017 as the members did not meet the definition of a worker under UK law.

A series of appeals were launched, culminating in the Supreme Court decision, which said they cannot benefit from union membership as they do not meet the definition of a worker or employee.

The IWGB had argued Deliveroo unlawfully interfered with riders' human rights by denying their application to be recognised for collective bargaining purposes.

Workers, under UK employment law, cannot be discriminated against nor have unlawful wage deductions - but don't receive the full range of legal rights conferred on employees.

Just over two years ago, Uber lost its Supreme Court battle and drivers were recognised as workers, not independent third-party contractors, meaning they are entitled to basic employment protections such as the minimum wage.

In the Uber case, judges concluded that drivers are ""in a position of subordination and dependency to Uber, such that they have little or no ability to improve their position through professional or entrepreneurial skills"".

The IWGB said it was disappointed at the Deliveroo ruling and was considering its options.

""Whether reflected in legislation or not, couriers are joining the union in ever bigger numbers and building our collective power to take action and hold companies like Deliveroo to account,"" a statement said.

""Our strength lies not in court rulings but in our unity as a workforce coming together to demand change.""

A Deliveroo spokesperson said: ""UK courts repeatedly and at every level have confirmed that Deliveroo riders are self-employed, and this now includes the Supreme Court, the highest court in the country.

""This is a positive judgment for Deliveroo riders, who value the flexibility that self-employed work offers.""","{'uri': 'news.sky.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'Sky News'}",[],https://e3.365dm.com/19/12/1600x900/skynews-deliveroo-rider-delivery_4855838.jpg?20191203202552,eng-9080034,0.1137254901960785,25,25,Sky News,news.sky.com

Three prominent US legal thinkers have announced a new organisation to champion conservative legal theory within the rule of law, to fight the threat of a second Donald Trump term.

""Our country comes first,"" the three wrote in the New York Times, ""and our country is in a constitutional emergency, if not a constitutional crisis. We all must act accordingly, especially us lawyers.""

The authors were George Conway, an attorney formerly married to Kellyanne Conway, Trump's White House counselor; J Michael Luttig, a retired judge and adviser to Trump's vice-president, Mike Pence, who became a prominent January 6 witness; and Barbara Comstock, a former Republican congresswoman from Virginia.

The authors also rebuked prominent rightwing groups including the Federalist Society for not resisting the former president and his authoritarian ambitions.

Their new group, the Society for the Rule of Law Institute, would ""work to inspire young legal talent ... focus on building a large body of scholarship to counteract the new orthodoxy of anti-constitutional and anti-democratic law ... [and] marshal principled voices to speak out against the endless stream of falsehoods and authoritarian legal theories ... propagated almost daily,"" they said.

The Federalist Society and its chair, Leonard Leo, played a key role in Trump's judicial appointments, installing three hardliners on the supreme court who helped hand down rightwing wins including removing abortion rights and loosening laws on gun control, affirmative action, voting rights and other progressive priorities.

Conway, Luttig and Comstock emerged among prominent conservative opponents of Trump, warning of his authoritarian threat before and after January 6, when rioters attacked Congress in an attempt to block Joe Biden's 2020 election win.

Ninety-one criminal charges and assorted civil threats notwithstanding, Trump is now the clear frontrunner for the Republican presidential nomination while polling strongly against Biden in battleground states.

""American democracy, the constitution and the rule of law are the righteous causes of our times, and the nation's legal profession is obligated to support them,"" Conway, Luttig and Comstock wrote.

""But with the acquiescence of the larger conservative legal movement, these pillars of our system of governance are increasingly in peril. The dangers will only grow should Donald Trump be returned to the White House next November.""

Trump, they said, would stock a second administration ""with partisan loyalists committed to fast-tracking his agenda and sidestepping - if not circumventing altogether - existing laws and long-established legal norms.

""This would include appointing ... political appointees to rubber-stamp his plans to investigate and exact retribution against his political opponents; make federal public servants removable at will by the president himself; and invoke special powers to take unilateral action on first amendment-protected activities, criminal justice, elections, immigration and more.""

Saying Trump tried such attacks when in power but was blocked by lawyers and judges, the authors said the former president would if re-elected ""arrive with a coterie of lawyers and advisers who, like him, are determined not to be thwarted again"".

Though they said the Federalist Society had long been ""the standard-bearer for the conservative legal movement"", they said it had ""failed to respond in this period of crisis.

""That is why we need an organisation of conservative lawyers committed to the foundational constitutional principles we once all agreed upon: the primacy of American democracy, the sanctity of the constitution and the rule of law, the independence of the courts, the inviolability of elections and mutual support among those tasked with the solemn responsibility of enforcing the laws of the United States.

Please try again later{{ /verifyErrors }}

The Duke of Sussex's lawyers are planning to ask ministers for permission to use confidential Leveson Inquiry documents in his legal action against the publisher of the Daily Mail, the High Court has been told.

Harry, alongside a number of other high-profile people, is suing Associated Newspapers Limited (ANL) over denied allegations of unlawful information gathering.

In a judgment earlier this month, a High Court judge ruled that the legal challenges could continue but could not use information drawn from ledgers given by ANL to the Leveson Inquiry into press standards in 2011 and 2012.

ANL argued that the documents were provided with the understanding that they were confidential and were covered by publication restriction orders over their use.

Mr Justice Nicklin concluded that Harry's lawyers using information from the ledgers to support his case was a breach of a restriction order made by the inquiry's chair Sir Brian Leveson.

At a follow-up hearing in London on Tuesday, the duke's barrister David Sherborne said his legal team's ""next step"" was to write to the Government over varying the Leveson Inquiry restriction to allow material to be used.

The court was told by ANL that it had rejected a request to hand over the ledgers voluntarily and would oppose a bid to ask a minister for access to them.

Adrian Beltrami KC, for the publisher, said in written arguments that in a situation where ""much, if not all"" of the cases brought by the duke and others ""may be unsustainable when shorn of information illegitimately drawn from the ledgers"" there could be ""no safe assumption"" over whether they can be disclosed at a later stage.

He said the ledgers had been given to Harry's lawyers in breach of ""clear obligations"" of confidentiality, adding lawyers had ""acted tactically and cynically in seeking to use such illegitimately obtained information to support their speculative claims"".

Mr Beltrami said any argument that ANL's refusal to share the material ""is merely a delaying tactic"" at this stage in the legal action was ""wholly misplaced and strongly rejected"".

Mr Sherborne, representing Harry and other individuals, said in written arguments that there appeared to be ""no rationale"" for ANL refusing to provide the ""plainly relevant"" documents at this stage ""other than perhaps to score a tactical advantage over the claimants and delay progress of the claims"".

The barrister said that given ANL had described the legal challenges as ""preposterous"" and said that it has ""nothing to hide"" it would be ""surprising"" for the publisher not to provide the material voluntarily.

""The claimants ask, rhetorically, what legitimate reason is there for the defendant not to do so if it genuinely believes that the allegations of unlawful conduct made against it are without foundation, as it has so repeatedly claimed,"" Mr Sherborne said.

The hearing, which dealt with consequences of the ruling, including the payment of legal costs, concluded on Tuesday.

A further case management may be held in early March next year.

Harry is joined by singer Sir Elton John in suing ANL, as well as campaigner Baroness Doreen Lawrence who watched some of the hearing from a public gallery at the Royal Courts of Justice.

The trio are among a group - including Sir Elton's husband David Furnish, actresses Sadie Frost and Liz Hurley and ex-MP Sir Simon Hughes - accusing the publisher of carrying out or commissioning unlawful activities such as hiring private investigators to listen in to phone calls, intercept voicemail messages, and ""blag"" private records through deception.

ANL, which firmly denies the allegations, previously asked Mr Justice Nicklin at a hearing in March to rule in its favour without a trial, arguing the legal challenges were brought ""far too late"".

But the judge ruled ANL had ""not been able to deliver a 'knockout blow' to the claims"" in his judgment on November 10.

Following the ruling, ANL said in a statement: ""As we have always made unequivocally clear, the lurid claims made by Prince Harry and others of phone hacking, landline tapping, burglary and sticky-window microphones are simply preposterous and we look forward to establishing this in court in due course.""","{'uri': 'independent.co.uk', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'The Independent'}",[],https://static.independent.co.uk/2023/11/21/14/a524410709ef56a1d1ea2161a6e7aa5bY29udGVudHNlYXJjaGFwaSwxNzAwNjU5ODEx-2.74519107.jpg?quality=75&width=1200&auto=webp,eng-9079670,-0.05882352941176472,25,25,The Independent,independent.co.uk

The Independent Workers Union of Great Britain sought to represent Deliveroo riders to improve working conditions for the people who scurry around the nation´s streets delivering takeout meals to customers. When Deliveroo refused to negotiate with the union, the workers appealed, arguing that the company was violating rights guaranteed by the European Convention on Human Rights.

The court rejected the appeal, ruling that the right to collective bargaining is only guaranteed when there is an ""employment relationship"" between the workers and the company. Deliveroo riders aren´t employees because their contract with the company gives them the ""virtually unfettered right to appoint a substitute to take on their jobs,"" the court said.

Deliveroo welcomed the decision, saying it confirmed lower court rulings that the company´s riders are self-employed.

""This is a positive judgment for Deliveroo riders, who value the flexibility that self-employed work offers,"" the company said in a statement.

The union called the ruling a ""disappointment.""

""Flexibility, including the option for account substitution, is no reason to strip workers of basic entitlements like fair pay and collective bargaining rights,"" the union said. ""This dangerous false dichotomy between rights and flexibility is one that Deliveroo and other gig economy giants rely heavily upon in efforts to legitimize their exploitative business models.""","{'uri': 'dailymail.co.uk', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'Daily Mail Online'}",[],,eng-9080034,0.06666666666666665,25,25,Daily Mail Online,dailymail.co.uk

The 2-1 decision by a panel of the 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals based in St. Louis found that only the attorney general can enforce Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act, which requires political maps to include districts where minority populations' preferred candidates can win elections.

The majority said other federal laws, including the 1964 Civil Rights Act, make it clear when private groups can sue but said similar wording is not found in the voting law.

""When those details are missing, it is not our place to fill in the gaps, except when 'text and structure' require it,"" Circuit Judge David R. Stras wrote for the majority in an opinion joined by Judge Raymond W. Gruender. Stras was nominated by former President Donald Trump and Gruender by former President George W. Bush.

The decision affirmed a lower judge's decision to dismiss a case brought by the Arkansas State Conference NAACP and the Arkansas Public Policy Panel after giving Attorney General Merrick Garland five days to join the lawsuit.

Chief Judge Lavenski R. Smith noted in a dissenting opinion that federal courts across the country and the Supreme Court have considered numerous cases brought by private plaintiffs under Section 2. Smith said the court should follow ""existing precedent that permits a judicial remedy"" unless the Supreme Court or Congress decides differently.

""Rights so foundational to self-government and citizenship should not depend solely on the discretion or availability of the government's agents for protection,"" wrote Smith, another appointee of Bush.

Sophia Lin Lakin, director of the ACLU's Voting Rights Project, called the ruling a ""travesty for democracy."" She had argued the appeal on behalf of the two Arkansas groups.

""By failing to reverse the district court's radical decision, the Eighth Circuit has put the Voting Rights Act in jeopardy, tossing aside critical protections that voters fought and died for,"" Lakin said in a statement.

It was not immediately clear whether the groups would appeal. A statement from the ACLU said they are exploring their options.

Barry Jefferson, political action chair of the Arkansas State Conference of the NAACP, called the ruling ""a devastating blow to the civil rights of every American, and the integrity of our nation's electoral system.""

The state NAACP chapter and the public policy group had challenged new Arkansas state House districts as diluting the influence of Black voters. The state's redistricting plan created 11 majority-Black districts, which the groups argued was too few. They said the state could have drawn 16 majority-Black districts to more closely mirror the state's demographics.

U.S. District Judge Lee Rudofsky noted there was ""a strong merits case that at least some of the challenged districts"" in the lawsuit violate the federal Voting Rights Act but said he could not rule after concluding a challenge could only be brought by the attorney general.

The Justice Department filed a ""statement of interest"" in the case saying private parties can file lawsuits to enforce the Voting Rights Act but declined to comment on the ruling.

Monday's ruling applies only to federal courts covered by the 8th Circuit, which includes Arkansas, Iowa, Minnesota, Missouri, Nebraska, North Dakota and South Dakota. Meanwhile, several pending lawsuits by private groups challenge various political maps drawn by legislators across the country.

It's likely the case eventually will make it to the Supreme Court, where the issue was raised in a 2021 opinion by Justice Neil Gorsuch.

""I join the court's opinion in full, but flag one thing it does not decide,"" Gorsuch wrote at the time, joined by Justice Clarence Thomas. ""Our cases have assumed -- without deciding -- that the Voting Rights Act of 1965 furnishes an implied cause of action under section 2.""

Gorsuch wrote that there was no need in that case for the justices to consider who may sue. But Gorsuch and Thomas were among the dissenters in June when the Supreme Court ruled 5-4 in another Voting Rights Act case in favor of Black voters in Alabama who objected to the state's congressional districts.

The Gorsuch and Thomas opinion was referenced less than two weeks ago in another federal court decision that came to the opposite conclusion of Monday's ruling by the St. Louis-based court.

On Nov. 10, three judges on the conservative-dominated 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in New Orleans rejected arguments that there is no private right to sue under the Voting Rights Act. In a Louisiana congressional redistricting case, the panel said the Supreme Court so far has upheld the right of private litigants to bring lawsuits alleging violations of Section 2, as have other appellate courts.

Fifth Circuit Judge Leslie Southwick, a nominee of Bush, pointed to separate cases from 1999 and 2020 that reaffirmed that right.

Election law experts say most challenges seeking to enforce Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act are brought by private plaintiffs and that the Justice Department has limited resources to pursue such cases. Some voting rights experts also noted the apparent contradiction in the Alabama case decided by the Supreme Court last June and Monday's ruling by the appellate court.

""It doesn't seem to make sense,"" said Jon Greenbaum, chief counsel for the Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights Under Law. ""If the laws were that private parties couldn't bring these cases, then the Alabama case would have never even gotten off the ground.""

Lawsuits under Section 2 have long been used to try to ensure that Black voters have adequate political representation in places with a long history of racism, including many Southern states. Racial gerrymandering has been used in drawing legislative and congressional districts to pack Black voters into a small number of districts or spread them out so their votes are diluted. If only the attorney general is able to file such cases, it could sharply limit their number and make challenges largely dependent on partisan politics.

It's unlikely Congress will be willing to act. Republicans have blocked recent efforts to restore protections in the Voting Rights Act that were tossed out by the Supreme Court a decade ago. In the 2013 Shelby v. Holder decision, justices dismantled an enforcement mechanism known as preclearance, which allowed for federal review of proposed election-related changes before they could take effect in certain states and communities with a history of discrimination.

In a statement, the Congressional Black Caucus noted that private individuals and civil rights groups have been successful in giving Black voters better representation through recent challenges to congressional maps drawn by Republican lawmakers in Alabama, Louisiana and Florida.

""This decision by the appellate court is ill-advised, cannot stand, and should be appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court, which we hope will reaffirm that citizens have a private right of action to bring forward lawsuits under Section 2,"" the group said.","{'uri': 'cbsnews.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'CBS News'}",[],https://assets1.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2023/11/21/3881d167-9540-4d11-b07c-054dfe07b039/thumbnail/1200x630g2/1ecc4c77c6dd7058a55e1660ffca9f50/ap18141819852808.jpg?v=5659e73acd91751548aa89950cf015b0,eng-9078082,0.09019607843137245,25,25,CBS News,cbsnews.com

The government considered releasing the man who sparked the landmark ruling on indefinite detention - even though he raped a 10-year-old boy - in a bid to stave off the high court challenge that led to the release of 92 others.

According to documents published by the high court, on 26 May an assistant secretary in the home affairs department wrote to the offices of both ministers responsible in an email titled ""NZYQ v Minister ... indefinite detention / Al Kateb challenge ... proposal to reconsider exercising ministerial intervention powers under the Act in light of litigation risk"".

The phrase ""ministerial intervention powers"" appears to be a reference to Migration Act powers to grant a visa, releasing NZYQ from detention and removing the foundation for the high court challenge.

The email calls into question a claim made by the home affairs minister, Clare O'Neil, on Sunday that the government was advised it was ""likely"" to win the case.

The documents also confirm that approaches were made to Five Eyes countries to deport the plaintiff, NZYQ, only after the government had agreed to the special case, which conceded it was likely impossible to deport him.

That concession opened the way for the high court to overturn the 2004 decision in which the court controversially found that indefinite detention is lawful even where it is not possible to deport the unlawful non-citizen.

In the wake of fierce Coalition criticism about Labor's handling of the aftermath of the case, O'Neil said the Albanese government ""had properly prepared for the decision"" despite thinking it was likely to win.

""We knew that there was a high court action on foot. We knew that it was 20 years of legal precedent and we were advised that it was likely that the commonwealth would win the case - that is, allow us to do what we wanted to do, which is keep these people in detention,"" O'Neil said on Sunday.

O'Neil said the comments were ""referring to operational advice from my department which detailed efforts to remove the individual in this case from Australia"".

""This would have meant that this case may not have needed to proceed,"" she told Guardian Australia.

""I was not referring to legal advice. I do not discuss legal advice received by the commonwealth.""

""The commonwealth and my department have been preparing for the loss for some time. This is why work was undertaken before the high court handed down its ruling.""

The 26 May email is contained in court documents evidencing efforts to resolve the case of NZYQ, the stateless Rohingyan man who brought the landmark case.

The email was written by Marian Agbinya, the assistant secretary of the migration and citizenship litigation branch, and addressed to a senior adviser in the office of the immigration minister, Andrew Giles.

More than a dozen others are copied in, including the departmental liaison officers and chiefs of staff in both Giles' and O'Neil's offices, the home affairs department secretary, Michael Pezzullo, and the associate secretary of immigration, Stephanie Foster.

Only the subject line is visible. The entire contents of the email is redacted because it is sensitive and subject to legal professional privilege, indicating it contains legal advice.

NZYQ's bridging visa was cancelled in 2015 when he pleaded guilty to sexual intercourse with a 10-year-old minor. In February 2023 Giles refused to use personal powers to allow NZYQ to reapply for a visa.

NZYQ filed his case in the high court on 5 April. The email's reference to ""ministerial intervention"" indicates the government reconsidered whether to release NZYQ just weeks after the case was launched and just months after the refusal.

On 8 November the high court ruled in favour of the man, which has triggered the release of 93 people in long-term detention for whom there is no ""real prospect"" that removal will be ""reasonably practicable in the foreseeable future"".

On the first day of the hearing, lawyers for NZYQ complained that the government only asked Five Eyes allies, Bangladesh and Saudi Arabia to resettle him ""under the shadow of this litigation"".

While the other nations responded negatively, the United States committed to having a ""hard look"" at the case, leading the government to argue it was ""continuing to take steps directed to the plaintiff's removal by seeking to identify countries to which he could be removed"".

Asked repeatedly on Monday why the government did not approach other nations to take NZYQ until after the it agreed to the special case on 30 May establishing it was impossible to deport him, O'Neil declined to answer.

""The NZYQ case has been before the high court, the information is there. I don't have any[thing] further to add about the proceedings at this stage,"" she said.

O'Neil also did not answer whether she signed off on the special case on 30 May or whether it was Giles.

The opposition home affairs spokesperson, James Paterson, said the government still had questions to answer over what actions were taken to deport in the lead-up to NZYQ's successful high court challenge, which could see up to 340 people in detention for more than a year released.

The government has spent the last week under intense political attack from the opposition over the high court decision, which led to urgent legislation being passed in the parliament imposing strict monitoring conditions on people released under the court order.

Labor has maintained that community safety has been at the forefront of its response to the court decision, while the Law Council of Australia has called for an immediate review of the legislation passed last week.","{'uri': 'theguardian.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","[{'uri': 'paul_karp@theguardian.com', 'name': 'Paul Karp', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': False}, {'uri': 'amy_remeikis@theguardian.com', 'name': 'Amy Remeikis', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': False}]",https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7490ff070e0c382a9b6d07537b3fa9bf1d72852d/1786_427_4237_2542/master/4237.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&s=bd8cb48bda17c1591ab052edf9fc93a8,eng-9074360,0.04313725490196085,25,25,The Guardian,theguardian.com

Deliveroo riders do not have the right to collective negotiations on pay and conditions, the UK's top court has ruled, in a blow to gig economy campaigners and the unions that represent them.

The Independent Workers' Union of Great Britain (IWGB) has been fighting through the courts since 2017 to have Deliveroo riders classified as ""workers"", with the right to unionise and bargain collectively for better terms and conditions.

On Tuesday, the supreme court upheld previous judgments that the thousands of UK riders were independent self-employed contractors, and could not be classed as workers because they had the right to arrange a substitute to perform their duties if they did not want to or were unable to.

The union said it was considering its options to challenge the ruling under international law - having reached the UK's highest court. Any challenge would be likely to involve taking the case to the European court of human rights, with a challenge brought against the UK government rather than Deliveroo, lawyers said.

""The supreme court's ruling comes as a disappointment after years spent fighting a legal battle to secure riders' bare minimum employment rights. As a union we cannot accept that thousands of riders should be working without key protections like the right to collective bargaining, and we will continue to make that case using all avenues available to us,"" IWGB said in a statement, adding that it was continuing to sign up more gig economy couriers in an attempt to hold companies to account.

""Flexibility, including the option for account substitution, is no reason to strip workers of basic entitlements like fair pay and collective bargaining rights. This dangerous false dichotomy between rights and flexibility is one that Deliveroo and other gig economy giants rely heavily upon in efforts to legitimise their exploitative business models,"" IWGB said.

Deliveroo said the outcome was ""a positive judgment for Deliveroo riders, who value the flexibility that self-employed work offers"", and that thousands of people continued to apply to work with Deliveroo every week.

It pointed to a deal with the GMB union under which riders receive free insurance, sickness cover and union recognition without being recognised as workers or employees. The ruling leaves the employer free to choose which union it might wish to recognise, without the risk of a challenge that it has not chosen its workers' preferred organisation.

Deliveroo said: ""UK courts repeatedly and at every level have confirmed that Deliveroo riders are self-employed, and this now includes the supreme court, the highest court in the country.

Yvonne Gallagher, partner at law firm Harbottle & Lewis said the case was ""a fundamentally important ruling for the gig economy, not just for Deliveroo.

""In establishing that the substitution clause works as a proof that riders cannot be considered workers, the supreme court ruling may give rise to other gig economy companies following the Deliveroo employment approach - where it fits their commercial model.""

She said that in the UK ""in many cases, the use of substitution clauses means that gig workers will not attract [basic employment rights such as the minimum wage and holiday pay]"".

Gallagher added that if IWGB wanted to challenge the supreme court ruling in international courts it would have to make a claim in the European court of human rights to argue that the UK has failed to implement its treaty obligations properly - so it would be ""a claim brought against the government"".

""Such claims can succeed in forcing governments to change the law, but insisting on widening the definition of those who qualify for employment rights does look quite a stretch,"" she said.","{'uri': 'theguardian.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","[{'uri': 'sarah_butler@theguardian.com', 'name': 'Sarah Butler', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': False}]",https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b4924447ffde04d42d48d3c47a86f276980235ee/0_118_4816_2890/master/4816.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&s=4b60a0520afdca59677283f154ece60b,eng-9080034,0.1529411764705881,25,25,The Guardian,theguardian.com

Mr Adams says claims against the Provisional IRA should be struck out - the three claimants disagree.

Lawyers representing Mr Adams and the three claimants are outlining legal arguments at a High Court hearing at the Royal Courts of Justice complex in London.

The hearing is due to end on Wednesday.

Barrister Richard Hermer KC, who is leading Mr Adams's legal team, described the case as ""unusual"".

He said the Provisional IRA was an ""unincorporated association"" which was ""incapable in law of being sued"".

Mr Hermer said the conduct of the claim had been ""characterised by a significant number of procedural breaches and irregularities"".

Barrister Anne Studd KC, who is leading the claimants' legal team, said each man alleged that Mr Adams was ""liable to them"" both as an ""individual given the part he played in the preparation and planning of the attacks"" and as a ""representative"" of the Provisional IRA.

""It is anticipated that (Mr Adams) will deny that he was ever a member of the (Provisional IRA), although currently the court should note that it has no evidence upon which to base that conclusion there being no defence entered and no statement from (Mr Adams) setting out his account,"" she told the judge in a written case outline.

""This case raises important issues on access to justice in cases where a group of claimants alleged the most heinous wrongdoing by an individual who they allege was a member of an organisation responsible for significant injury through terrorist means.

Beginning a legal challenge to the Northern Ireland Troubles (Legacy and Reconciliation) Act at Belfast High Court, barrister John Larkin KC also said that a new commission which will take over thousands of unsolved deaths would be the ""only show in town"" for victims but that its architecture was ""inadequate"" and ""defective"".

The Act received royal assent in September despite widespread opposition from political parties, victims' organisations in Northern Ireland and the Irish government.

Aspects of the laws include a limited form of immunity from prosecution for Troubles-related offences for those who co-operate with the new Independent Commission for Reconciliation and Information Recovery (ICRIR).

The new Act will also halt future civil cases and legacy inquests.

The legal challenge, being brought by a number of Troubles victims and heard by Mr Justice Colton, argues that the Act does not comply with human rights law.

Opening the proceedings, Mr Larkin read from the affidavits of a number of Troubles victims whose cases are being heard jointly.

Troubles victim Martina Dillon at the Royal Courts of Justice (Liam McBurney/PA)

These included the affidavit of Martina Dillon, whose husband Seamus was shot dead in Dungannon in 1997.

The barrister said Mrs Dillon's grief in losing her husband was as raw today as the night he was killed.

Her affidavit said that suspected perpetrators ""can safely sleep at night knowing they will never be held accountable"" as long as the Legacy Act exists.

Mr Larkin said the Troubles had left an ""enormous collective pain"".

He added: ""A pain created by individual events but a pain that is now subject to a form of secondary traumatisation through the provisions in this Act.""

Turning to the individual provisions of the Act, Mr Larkin said if the ICRIR had been created alongside existing structures there might be little to condemn it.

He added: ""But it is the fact that this is an exclusive body, inadequate in its capacities, which extinguishes existing rights, that however imperfectly have been use in an attempt to secure truth and justice.""

The barrister described references in the Act that the ICRIR would promote reconciliation as a form of ""meretricious window dressing"".

But the commission is the only show in town and it is a defective show John Larkin KC

He added: ""If the commission stood alone there might well be complaints one might make about it if one had the faculty of going to the commission instead of seeking an inquest or bringing civil proceedings or criminal proceedings.

""But the commission is the only show in town and it is a defective show, and other shows which have been established to have worked well in the past are closed down.""

Turning to the immunity provisions of the Act, Mr Larkin said the powers would go beyond any immunity powers granted to a public inquiry.

He said: ""All that is required is a truthful, incriminating account.

""There does not have to be any expression, sincere or otherwise of remorse, there does not have to be any acknowledgement of wrongdoing in a moral sense and the account can be accompanied by triumphalism, crowing, by glorification of the criminal act.

""The panel does not have any discretion, any rule for withholding immunity once conditions are met.

""In the context of a measure which is badged as promoting reconciliation, we say the structure for immunity is fundamentally antithetical to any proper approach to reconciliation and actively harms reconciliation.""

Mr Larkin said the Act did not address the suffering of victims, but instead shut it down.

I shouldn't have to be here today to go and fight for truth and justice which I believe I am entitled to Martina Dillon

Speaking before the case started, Mrs Dillon said she hoped the courts would listen to the voices of victims.

She said: ""I am here today to fight for my husband Seamus Dillon and for each and every other victim that needs this law to be changed, and for the courts to please listen and help us.""

""I shouldn't have to be here today to go and fight for truth and justice which I believe I am entitled to.""

Amnesty International, which is supporting the legal challenge, called on the Irish Government to proceed with an inter-state legal case against the legacy laws.

The case is being heard at the Royal Courts of Justice in Belfast (Liam McBurney/PA)

Grainne Teggart said: ""Today's case is hugely significant, not only for the victims challenging this law, but for every Troubles victim having truth and justice cruelly denied to them.

""We repeatedly warned the UK Government during the passage of this legislation that if they pushed this through to law, we would see them in court.

""That is what we are doing here today. Today is day one in the fightback against this law which prioritises perpetrators at the expense of victims' rights.""

She added: ""We call on the Irish Government to swiftly make a decision to take an inter-state case. It is not right that the burden of legal challenge falls solely on the shoulders of victims.

The Independent Workers Union of Great Britain (IWGB) wants to represent Deliveroo riders in north London in order to negotiate on issues of pay, hours and holiday with the company.

After losing a bid for recognition at a specialist tribunal in 2017, the IWGB unsuccessfully challenged that decision at the High Court and Court of Appeal, and in April the union took its case to the Supreme Court.

However, in a unanimous ruling on Tuesday, five justices at the UK's highest court dismissed the appeal.

Clearly there is nothing in the UK legislation to stop the riders from forming their own union or joining the union as they have done. There is also nothing to prevent Deliveroo from engaging in collective bargaining with the union to seek to agree the terms and conditions applied to the riders if they so choose Supreme Court judgment

In the judgment, Lord Lloyd-Jones and Lady Rose said they agreed with previous decisions that riders are not in an ""employment relationship"" with Deliveroo and are therefore not entitled to collective bargaining rights.

The justices said multiple factors, including that riders are free to reject offers of work and to work for Deliveroo's competitors, are ""fundamentally inconsistent"" with such a relationship.

Part of the case focused on whether the arrangement between the food delivery app and its riders fell under the scope of Article 11 of the European Convention on Human Rights - which covers the right to join trade unions.

Rejecting this argument, the justices said: ""Clearly there is nothing in the UK legislation to stop the riders from forming their own union or joining the union as they have done.

Deliveroo riders have protested against the pay and conditions offered by Deliveroo (Flora Bowen/PA)

""There is also nothing to prevent Deliveroo from engaging in collective bargaining with the union to seek to agree the terms and conditions applied to the riders if they so choose.""

They continued: ""The issue is whether Article 11 requires the United Kingdom to go beyond that current position and to enact legislation conferring on Article 11 workers the right to require their reluctant employer to recognise and negotiate with the union of their choice.""

The IWGB's initial application to be recognised for collective bargaining purposes was first refused by a specialist tribunal in November 2017.

The Central Arbitration Committee rejected the union's application as riders were able to pass a job to a substitute, meaning they were not obliged to provide a ""personal service"" and could not be classified as ""workers"".

Following the Supreme Court's ruling, a Deliveroo spokesperson said: ""UK courts repeatedly and at every level have confirmed that Deliveroo riders are self-employed, and this now includes the Supreme Court, the highest court in the country.

""This is a positive judgement for Deliveroo riders, who value the flexibility that self-employed work offers.

""Thousands apply each week to work with Deliveroo because they want to be able to decide for themselves when, where and whether to work.

""We are proud to be able to offer tens of thousands of riders this flexibility alongside the security of free insurance, sickness coverage, support for new parents and a unique union recognition agreement.

""We will continue to listen to and work with riders to offer them the work they tell us they want.""

In a statement, the IWGB said the ruling came as a ""disappointment"".

It continued: ""As a union we cannot accept that thousands of riders should be working without key protections like the right to collective bargaining, and we will continue to make that case using all avenues available to us, including considering our options under international law.""

The union added: ""Flexibility, including the option for account substitution, is no reason to strip workers of basic entitlements like fair pay and collective bargaining rights.

""This dangerous false dichotomy between rights and flexibility is one that Deliveroo and other gig economy giants rely heavily upon in efforts to legitimise their exploitative business models.""","{'uri': 'dailymail.co.uk', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'Daily Mail Online'}",[],https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2023/11/21/12/wire-78059337-1700570045-468_636x382.jpg,eng-9080034,0.3019607843137255,25,25,Daily Mail Online,dailymail.co.uk

‘The judiciary is mindful that not all proceedings are suitable for live broadcasting,’ Legislative Council panel says

Hong Kong courts will start to live stream some proceedings early next year in a bid to boost public confidence in the city’s justice system.

The city’s judiciary told a Legislative Council panel on Tuesday that courts were planning to broadcast the cases deemed appropriate to the public.

“The judiciary is mindful that not all proceedings are suitable for live broadcasting,” the panel paper said. “The judiciary is examining the guiding principles as well as the implementation practicalities of live broadcasting of court proceedings.”

The plan was first announced by Chief Justice Andrew Cheung Kui-nung earlier during the opening of the legal year, with the top judge calling the move a “natural way forward”.

He added it would increase transparency and bolster confidence in the legal system.

The step will also bring Hong Kong in line with law jurisdictions in Britain, Canada, Australia, and the United States, all of which broadcast proceedings at their top courts.

The US Supreme Court only allows audio recordings of arguments during hearings as it upholds a ban on cameras in the courtroom. The High Court of Australia, meanwhile, provides audio and video recordings a day after it has finished sitting.

In January, Chief Justice Cheung said that not all trials, especially those involving a jury and vulnerable witnesses, would be suitable for live broadcasting, and suggested beginning with appellate proceedings, particularly those at the Court of Final Appeal.

But he warned that the judiciary should also consider possible misuse of broadcast trials or doxxing of judges and legal representatives.

Britain allowed cameras in a criminal trial for the first time in England and Wales in July last year, when a manslaughter case was televised.

Filming was limited to the sentencing, with only the judge appearing on camera. The British government said the move would give the public a greater understanding of the judicial process.Hong Kong judges try out AI to speed up transcribing as lawyers see its potential

Bar Association chairman Victor Dawes told the Post that he supported the judiciary’s move to further adopt technology.

“From a logistical point of view, appeal hearing may be more suitable for trial runs but the judiciary will have a better understanding on logistical issues,” he said.

Senior counsel Ronny Tong Ka-wah welcomed the move, describing it as a “good step forward”.

He suggested starting with simple criminal and civil cases without sensitive information, expressing confidence that existing restrictions would be enough to prevent footage misuse.

“As cases are open hearings anyway, the usual sanctions as to deliberate misreporting should apply. If need be, there should be clear legislative guidelines issued,” Tong said.

Separately, the judiciary said it would consult the legal profession and other court users at the end of the year on the mandatory use of its electronic case management system, inviting the profession and litigants to contribute their views on a suitable timetable, legislative amendments, exemptions and support needed to make the electronic system a default in the city’s proceedings.

Since last year, e-filing of legal papers has been allowed at the District Court for personal injury cases, tax claims, civil action and employees’ compensation cases, and simple cases at the Magistrates’ Courts involving summonses.

Law firms and litigants must be registered on the electronic case management system to file legal documents and make payments online, instead of using over-the-counter services at city courts.Courting technology: why some Hong Kong lawyers are slow to go paperless

The judiciary administrator added that by the end of October, 350 court users, including 283 law firms, registered accounts under the electronic system, a sharp increase from 43 law firms reported in February.

The system also handled 24.2 per cent of eligible cases between last May and October this year, according to the judiciary.

Starting next year, the judiciary will “incrementally” roll out the electronic system to the Court of Final Appeal, the High Court, non-summons cases at Magistrates’ Courts and the Small Claims Tribunal.","{'uri': 'scmp.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'South China Morning Post'}",[],https://cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/d8/images/canvas/2023/11/21/d19e7d02-c5eb-4b30-aeac-c6cba5c53be4_51431bc2.jpg?itok=OwiUt10y,,0.3411764705882352,25,25,South China Morning Post,scmp.com

Beginning a legal challenge to the Northern Ireland Troubles (Legacy and Reconciliation) Act at Belfast High Court, barrister John Larkin KC also said that a new commission which will take over thousands of unsolved deaths would be the ""only show in town"" for victims but that its architecture was ""inadequate"" and ""defective"".

The Act received royal assent in September despite widespread opposition from political parties, victims' organisations in Northern Ireland and the Irish government.

Aspects of the laws include a limited form of immunity from prosecution for Troubles-related offences for those who co-operate with the new Independent Commission for Reconciliation and Information Recovery (ICRIR).

The new Act will also halt future civil cases and legacy inquests.

The legal challenge, being brought by a number of Troubles victims and heard by Mr Justice Colton, argues that the Act does not comply with human rights law.

Opening the proceedings, Mr Larkin read from the affidavits of a number of Troubles victims whose cases are being heard jointly.

These included the affidavit of Martina Dillon, whose husband Seamus was shot dead in Dungannon in 1997.

The barrister said Mrs Dillon's grief in losing her husband was as raw today as the night he was killed.

Her affidavit said that suspected perpetrators ""can safely sleep at night knowing they will never be held accountable"" as long as the Legacy Act exists.

Mr Larkin said the Troubles had left an ""enormous collective pain"".

He added: ""A pain created by individual events but a pain that is now subject to a form of secondary traumatisation through the provisions in this Act.""

Turning to the individual provisions of the Act, Mr Larkin said if the ICRIR had been created alongside existing structures there might be little to condemn it.

He added: ""But it is the fact that this is an exclusive body, inadequate in its capacities, which extinguishes existing rights, that however imperfectly have been use in an attempt to secure truth and justice.""

The barrister described references in the Act that the ICRIR would promote reconciliation as a form of ""meretricious window dressing"".

He added: ""If the commission stood alone there might well be complaints one might make about it if one had the faculty of going to the commission instead of seeking an inquest or bringing civil proceedings or criminal proceedings.

""But the commission is the only show in town and it is a defective show, and other shows which have been established to have worked well in the past are closed down.""

Turning to the immunity provisions of the Act, Mr Larkin said the powers would go beyond any immunity powers granted to a public inquiry.

He said: ""All that is required is a truthful, incriminating account.

""There does not have to be any expression, sincere or otherwise of remorse, there does not have to be any acknowledgement of wrongdoing in a moral sense and the account can be accompanied by triumphalism, crowing, by glorification of the criminal act.

""The panel does not have any discretion, any rule for withholding immunity once conditions are met.

""In the context of a measure which is badged as promoting reconciliation, we say the structure for immunity is fundamentally antithetical to any proper approach to reconciliation and actively harms reconciliation.""

Mr Larkin said the Act did not address the suffering of victims, but instead shut it down.

Speaking before the case started, Mrs Dillon said she hoped the courts would listen to the voices of victims.

She said: ""I am here today to fight for my husband Seamus Dillon and for each and every other victim that needs this law to be changed, and for the courts to please listen and help us.""

""I shouldn't have to be here today to go and fight for truth and justice which I believe I am entitled to.""

Amnesty International, which is supporting the legal challenge, called on the Irish Government to proceed with an inter-state legal case against the legacy laws.

Grainne Teggart said: ""Today's case is hugely significant, not only for the victims challenging this law, but for every Troubles victim having truth and justice cruelly denied to them.

""We repeatedly warned the UK Government during the passage of this legislation that if they pushed this through to law, we would see them in court.

""That is what we are doing here today. Today is day one in the fightback against this law which prioritises perpetrators at the expense of victims' rights.""

She added: ""We call on the Irish Government to swiftly make a decision to take an inter-state case. It is not right that the burden of legal challenge falls solely on the shoulders of victims.

""We note that Leo Varadkar has said in recent days that a decision will be imminent in the coming weeks. We call on them to follow through with their opposition to this law and take that case.""

Janet Mills and Attorney General Aaron Frey have tasked the commission with performing a review of the events leading up to the Lewiston shootings and the response to it. Army reservist Robert Card, 40, killed 18 people in a bowling alley and a restaurant on Oct. 25 before dying of a self-inflicted gunshot wound.

The commission held its first meeting on Monday and members unanimously voted to request subpoena power from the Maine Legislature.

""We will be seeking military records, and those might not be accessible to us without subpoena power,"" said Toby Dilworth, a former assistant U.S. attorney for the District of Maine and a commission member. ""It's essential that we have this subpoena power.""

The commission is chaired by Daniel Wathen, former chief justice of the Maine Supreme Judicial Court. Other members include Debra Baeder, the former chief forensic psychologist for the state, and Paula Silsby, a former U.S. attorney for the District of Maine.

The panel is expected to investigate potential missed opportunities to prevent the shootings. Card was well known to law enforcement and fellow service members had raised flags about his behavior, mental health state and potential for violence before the shootings. Card spent two weeks in a psychiatric hospital in New York last summer after an altercation with other reserve members.

Mills and Frey swiftly released a statement that they supported the move to use subpoena power. Mills, who created the commission via executive order, has called on the commission to follow the facts of the case and keep them as transparent to the public as possible.

Mills and Frey said in their statement they would ""immediately begin consulting with the Independent Commission and legislative leadership to prepare legislation granting the commission the power of subpoena, with the goal of having that legislation prepared for the Legislature's consideration at the beginning of the next session.""

The commission will meet again on Dec. 14, Wathen said. He said his goal was for the commission to produce a written report within six months, which was a timeline he called ""a very ambitious goal, but highly desirable for obvious reasons.""

The commission also took comments from the public on Monday. Rep. Suzanne Salisbury, a Westbrook Democrat, called on the commission to collaborate with law enforcement as it performs its review.

Former President Donald Trump is about to learn once again that the First Amendment, while sweeping in its protections of speech from government interference, isn't absolute. Based on arguments at the Washington, D.C., Circuit Court of Appeals on Monday, it seems likely that the appellate court will at least partially reimpose a gag order against Trump in the federal election interference case. While the order would limit what Trump can say, it would allow others to speak the truth.

Last month, District Judge Tanya Chutkan imposed a limited gag order against the former president, which prohibited him from disparaging the court staff, the special prosecutor and his staff and likely future witnesses. The order was far narrower in scope than the one requested by prosecutors: Chutkan declined to include statements that Trump may make about Washington, the Justice Department in general, the federal government more broadly or the judge herself.

Chutkan's order struck a delicate balance between the First Amendment rights of a political candidate and the need to protect the administration of justice. As Chutkan noted, Trump's ""presidential candidacy does not give him carte blanche to vilify and implicitly encourage violence against public servants who are simply doing their job.""

Trump appealed the order, and the circuit court put it on hold while it considers the case. On Monday, a three-judge panel of appellate judges heard arguments about the gag order -- and it didn't go well for Trump. The judges appear very likely to uphold the order, while potentially limiting its scope.

Trump and his team focused on his speech rights and incorrectly asserted that, unlike every other person in this country, the former president possesses an ""absolute freedom"" to say what he wishes. This freedom, they argued, holds no matter how much he threatens court staff members, prosecutors or potential witnesses. The prosecution, understandably, focused on the need to protect the administration of justice broadly and those court employees, special counsel Jack Smith and his staff and possible witnesses.

Trump's arguments, if accepted by the court, would essentially mean that a court would at least have to wait until there has been documented witness intimidation before imposing a gag order. Such a standard can't be and isn't the law. While we have never had a case exactly like this one, gag orders aren't per se unconstitutional, and they are allowed when circumstances justify them, such as to prevent harassment of witnesses, prejudice of the jury or the publication of trade secrets or other confidential information.

While Trump and his supporters frame the gag order as silencing one man, this gag order would actually allow far more people to speak.

It is true that we have never seen a gag order like the one in this case. But we have never elected a president who sought to undermine the peaceful transfer of power and, allegedly, engage in crimes to do so. We have never had a former president who called prosecutors a ""team of thugs."" We have never had a former president-turned-criminal defendant with an apparent history of testing the line when it comes to witness tampering.

When Trump, the criminal defendant, and yes, the political candidate, speaks, he attempts to silence others. A limited gag order would still allow him to vigorously defend himself in the legal and political spheres, yet crucially it would protect those who are called to testify. Trump is entitled to speak, and the public has the right to listen. But in a criminal case, his speech can -- and must -- be balanced against the public's right to the fair administration of justice, which includes the ability of witnesses to testify free of threats and intimidation.

Gag orders should be narrowly tailored and imposed as a last resort, when they are basically the only way to allow the legal system to function fairly. Trump isn't wrong in saying that when a gag order is placed on a political candidate, we need to tread carefully. Political speech stands at the apex of protected speech. And political speech targeted at government officials is just the type of speech the government would want to censor.

But Trump is wrong in saying that there is only one side of the scale to consider. Our democracy depends on the quaint idea that the rule of law still exists. The criminal justice system will crater if bullies can hide behind the First Amendment and intimidate those who keep the system working -- court staff members and prosecutors. Similarly, criminal trials will become farces if defendants can merely intimidate witnesses into silence.

Limiting Trump's speech is not just consistent with decades of judicial precedents. It is essential for this case to proceed in a timely and fair fashion. Only with a narrowly tailored gag order can Americans be confident that the eventual verdict, however the jury decides, will reflect the rule of law.","{'uri': 'msnbc.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'MSNBC.com'}",[],"https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_nbcnews-fp-1024-512,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2023-11/231120-donald-trump-se-125p-3fed37.jpg",eng-9078152,0.01960784313725483,25,25,MSNBC.com,msnbc.com

Officials in Strasbourg are investigating a suspected meteorite strike, after a parked car was found with a 50-centimetre diameter hole in its roof.

The fire department were called out early on Monday morning to reports of smoke coming from a car which was parked in a suburb of the city in north-east France.

""Following reconnaissance by the first team, we suspect the fall of a stellar body,"" wrote the Bas-Rhin Sdis, the regional fire department, in its intervention report published mid-day.

""When we arrived, we noticed a relatively large impact, around 50 centimetres in diameter, which had gone through the roof, underbody and fuel tank of the vehicle"", fire department captain Matthieu Colobert told AFP.

A search concluded that there was no radioactivity.

""No object was found,"" he continued. ""Either the object was so small that we can't find it, or the impact was such that the object disintegrated and turned to dust"", he suggested.

Colobert said his team does have a ""suspicion"" about a gravel stone which is around two centimetres wide, which was found at the scene. It has been handed to police for further analysis.

A police spokesman told AFP: ""It's about the size of a hazelnut, looks like burnt wood, very light."" He announced that the object would be sent to Paris to a forensics department.

Second District Judge John Judge in Moscow, Idaho, said the court would, however, operate a livestream, available on its YouTube channel, that would ensure members of the public can observe the proceedings.

Bryan Kohberger is charged with four counts of murder in connection with the deaths at a rental house near the university campus in Moscow last November. A judge entered a not-guilty plea on Kohberger's behalf earlier this year. Latah County Prosecutor Bill Thompson has said he intends to seek the death penalty, and the case is scheduled for trial this fall, although it could be postponed.

The judge had been allowing news cameras in the courtroom during hearings under strict conditions, but on Friday, he granted a request by Kohberger's attorneys to ban them. Judge wrote that some photographic and video coverage had zoomed in on Kohberger, despite his directive that shots show the entire courtroom, and that some shots depicted him entering or exiting the courtroom, despite orders that images only be taken when court is on the record and not in recess.

""It is the intense focus on Kohberger and his every move, along with adverse headlines and news articles, that leads the Court to conclude that continued photograph and video coverage inside the courtroom by the media should no longer be permitted,"" Judge wrote.

Wendy Olson, an attorney representing a coalition of media organizations, including The Associated Press, which sought to preserve their ability to take photos and video during hearings in the case, did not immediately respond to an email and phone call seeking comment Monday evening.

The bodies of Madison Mogen, Kaylee Goncalves, Xana Kernodle and Ethan Chapin were found Nov. 13, 2022, at a home across the street from the University of Idaho campus. Investigators pieced together DNA evidence, cellphone data and surveillance video that they say links Kohberger to the slayings.

According to the affidavit, Kohberger's cellphone pinged in the vicinity of the house 12 times prior to the murders. Steve Goncalves, Kaylee's father, told ""48 Hours"" in September that before the gag order, one of the lead investigators told him they believe Kohberger had been scouting out the house.

""He had to know when people were coming, people were going,"" Steve Goncalves said.

Kohberger was a graduate student studying criminology at Washington State University, which is a short drive from the scene of the killings across the state border. He was arrested at his parents' home in Pennsylvania, and the unusual details of the case have drawn widespread interest.

Judge said his order, which cannot be appealed, would balance the public's interest with Kohberger's right to a fair trial and the orderly administration of justice, because the court would not have to monitor who was recording images of what.

""To be clear, the Court is not accusing all journalists and media outlets of violating the Court's orders,"" he wrote. ""However, Court operated video system will give the Court greater control over what is being videoed, will lessen the burden on the bailiffs, will help to alleviate counsels' concerns, and will allow the media and the public access to the video footage of the proceedings.""

Last month, the judge rejected a motion to throw out Kohberger's indictment.

Kohberger's lawyers had argued his indictment should be thrown out on the grounds of ""error in grand jury instructions,"" CBS affiliate KREM reported.

Kohberger's defense took particular issue with the burden of proof being established to the jury as ""probable cause"" instead of ""beyond a reasonable doubt,"" which it argued was not standard in the state of Idaho, KREM reported.","{'uri': 'cbsnews.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'CBS News'}",[],https://assets2.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2023/01/05/b50fe43f-dd6e-42ab-9805-a2d170032ff6/thumbnail/1200x630/c85ca77c573aa42e08758e85f552eb2f/hypatia-h-7684bae553386d54659e1c8803486a58-h-762df0713e16ad419212a71292d3cd19.jpg?v=5659e73acd91751548aa89950cf015b0,eng-9078341,-0.3254901960784313,25,25,CBS News,cbsnews.com

Rishi Sunak's plan to rush through new laws, enabling illegal asylum seekers to be deported to Rwanda for processing of their claims, is doomed to fail, according to a major new expert study.

Wisconsin's supreme court will hear oral argument on Tuesday in a high-stakes lawsuit seeking to strike down the maps for the state's legislature. The result could bring an end to what may be the most gerrymandered districts in the United States and upend politics in Wisconsin.

The case, Clarke v Wisconsin Elections Commission, could bring an end to more than a decade of Republican dominance in the Wisconsin legislature. In 2011, Republicans drew districts for the state legislature that were so distorted in their favor that it made it impossible for them to lose their majorities. Last year, the state supreme court implemented new maps that made as little change as possible from the old ones when lawmakers and the state's Democratic governor reached a redistricting impasse.

The map for Wisconsin's state assembly may be the most gerrymandered body in the US. It packs Democrats into as few districts as possible while splitting their influence elsewhere. Even though Wisconsin is one of America's most politically competitive states, Republicans have never held fewer than 60 seats in the state assembly since 2012. The gerrymandering in the assembly carries over to the state senate, where Wisconsin law requires districts to be comprised of three assembly districts.

The case was filed the day after Janet Protasiewicz formally took her seat on the supreme court in August, flipping control of the bench and giving liberals a 4-3 majority. Protasiewicz, who called the maps ""rigged"" during her campaign last year, a comment that has prompted Republicans in the legislature to threaten impeaching her.

The challengers in the case argue that the maps are unconstitutional for two reasons. First, they say, 75 of the state's 132 legislative districts are non-contiguous. That is a clear violation of a mandate in the state's constitution that says districts have to ""be bounded by county, precinct, town or ward lines, to consist of contiguous territory and be in as compact form as practicable"".

Second, they argue that the way the maps came to be implemented ran afoul of the state constitution. In 2021, the state supreme court took over the redistricting process after Governor Tony Evers, a Democrat, vetoed a GOP-drawn plan. The court, which then had a conservative majority, invited a range of submissions for a new map, but announced it would pick a proposal that made as little change as possible to the existing maps. It initially chose a plan drawn by Evers, but that map was rejected by the US supreme court. The state supreme court then chose a different plan submitted by legislative Republicans. It was the same map Evers had vetoed in 2021.

That decision, the challengers argue, allowed the legislature to essentially override Evers's veto, the challengers say, violating the separation of powers between governmental branches.

Republicans argue that the districts are constitutional. Several localities in Wisconsin have annexed non-contiguous territories so to keep localities whole. The state supreme court also exercised a constitutionally permissible role in choosing a map, they say, because the governor and lawmakers had reached an impasse.

The state elections commission has said that it would need any maps to be in place for next year's elections no later than 15 March 2024 so a decision from the supreme court is expected relatively quickly.","{'uri': 'theguardian.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","[{'uri': 'sam_levine@theguardian.com', 'name': 'Sam Levine', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': False}]",https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f2ffc41cd353d349aa6d1c360e18d99882a9718b/0_140_3648_2189/master/3648.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&s=b3c3430e80d8a2952d4c6c6ed9fb71ba,eng-9078388,0.1372549019607843,25,25,The Guardian,theguardian.com

County fire foundation collected donations despite fundraising ban,"Los Angeles County Supervisor Janice Hahn has called for an investigation into the Los Angeles County Fire Department Foundation after learning that the charity, created to financially support the county Fire Department, may have collected donations months after the state barred it from fundraising.

On March 10, the California Department of Justice, which regulates charities, informed the foundation by mail that it had not submitted a routine annual financial form for 2021. Four months later, the department sent another letter informing the foundation that it was now considered ""delinquent,"" meaning it could not raise funds or dole out donations, per state regulations.

The nonprofit, which has its own volunteer board of directors, was formed in 2016 to support the Fire Department, hosting ceremonies for agency personnel and buying equipment. The foundation's website asks for donations for wildfire support, mechanical CPR devices and new ropes, among other needs.

""Your donations save lives that taxes cannot,"" the website reads.

Hahn in a statement she was ""outraged and disappointed"" that the foundation kept taking in these donations months after being notified by the state it was behind on its paperwork.

""Whether it was malicious or accidental, there is no excuse for jeopardizing this organization that has become so important to our firefighters or for misleading donors who thought they were contributing to a nonprofit in good standing,"" she said. ""I am calling for a full investigation into exactly what happened and why it took so long for the fire chief and the Board of Supervisors to be told.""

Stacy Mungo Flanigan, the foundation's president, said she did not know until last month that the organization was delinquent.

Flanigan said she received the March letter from the Department of Justice informing the foundation it was missing paperwork only in mid-October when it showed up in her mailbox -- already opened. She said the mailbox is located at the county Fire Department headquarters, and she checks it only about once a month.

""The moral of the story is, I didn't know,"" she said. ""The moment I knew we were delinquent, we took it seriously.""

The Department of Justice sent out additional letters to the foundation on July 21 and Sept. 29, informing it of its delinquent status and warning that it could lose its tax-exempt status if the proper paperwork wasn't filed. Flanigan said she never received either of those letters.

At Tuesday's Board of Supervisors meeting, Hahn plans to ask her colleagues to join her in a motion that asks the county's lawyers to investigate the foundation and find out if ""any deliberate or unintentional wrongdoing has occurred."" The motion also asks for an audit of the money the charity has received and spent since it was formed in the spring of 2016.

Flanigan said the foundation plays a critical role for the department. Since 2019, she said, it has given roughly $5 million to the department for items including Pelotons, jaws of life, refrigerators and mechanical CPR devices.

She also noted multiple charitable organizations that support county employees have, at one point, been placed on delinquent status by the Department of Justice.

After the March letter turned up this fall, she said she immediately sent the missing paperwork to the Department of Justice and expects the foundation to be back in good standing, though it is unclear when. She said she was told it could take up to three months for the state agency to process the documents.

Fire Chief Anthony Marrone said the department will ""fully cooperate"" with an investigation into the foundation.

On Wednesday, Marrone told the foundation's board of directors in a letter that the department would stop taking donations from the foundation. He also ordered the foundation to remove the department ""name, likeness and logo"" from its website and postpone an upcoming celebration it had planned in honor of the department's 100th anniversary.

The same day, he sent out a memo barring staff from requesting donations from the foundation and buying items from the foundation store, which sells T-shirts, keychains and pins.

Flanigan said Marrone's decision has ground the foundation's gift-giving to a halt.

She will stop paying the cellphone bills for the 585 iPads the foundation bought for firefighters, and is now storing 36 washers and dryers meant for the county's fire stations.","{'uri': 'latimes.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'Los Angeles Times'}",[],https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/c7ac484/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6258x3520+0+326/resize/1200x675!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F19%2F35%2Ff8240e5d40bc91370878be616188%2F1170750-me-0819-vanessa-bryant-trial-003-ik.jpg,,0.1607843137254903,25,25,Los Angeles Times,latimes.com

The Independent Workers Union of Great Britain (IWGB) had tried to represent a group of Deliveroo riders in order to negotiate pay and conditions with the company.

The union was first refused permission in 2017 on the basis that riders were not ""workers"" under UK labour law and it has since mounted a number of appeals.

The IWGB took its case to the UK's highest court in April, arguing that it was an unlawful interference with riders' human rights to deny the IWGB's application to be recognised by Deliveroo for collective bargaining.

But the Supreme Court unanimously dismissed the IWGB's appeal in a ruling on Tuesday.

Donald Trump's legal team was in federal court in Washington, DC on Monday for oral arguments concerning the partial gag order imposed on the former president in his federal election interference case.

Judge Tanya Chutkan ruled that Mr Trump cannot make ""disparaging or ""inflammatory"" comments about people or entities involved in the case brought by Special Counsel Jack Smith.

Mr Trump's team argued that as he is running for president any restrictions on what he can say while he campaigns would violate his right to free speech.

A panel of judges didn't appear to buy that argument, but an official ruling is yet to be made.

Meanwhile, the former president's civil fraud trial in New York enters its eighth week. In that trial, Mr Trump's attorneys won a pause on the gag order imposed on him there.

The British government's aggressive politicisation of human rights is a dangerous assault on democracy that must be halted before irrevocable damage is done, the UK director of Human Rights Watch (HRW) has warned.

In an exclusive interview with the Guardian, Yasmine Ahmed, who has been the UK director of HRW since November 2020, said the government indicating it could ""disapply"" the Human Rights Act to an emergency bill that will allow it to send asylum seekers to Rwanda - despite the supreme court ruling the policy illegal - is part of an escalating attack on human rights.

""With previous governments there was always an attempt to at least try to appear as if they were comply ing with domestic or international human rights law and to respect the courts and human rights institutions,"" Ahmed said. ""Now there is no attempt to do this - in fact, it's quite the opposite.""

She continued: ""Rishi Sunak's government must know that even scrapping the Human Rights Act will not prevent it from facing significant legal barriers to its Rwanda policy, but what we're seeing is the UK moving towards a place where the government feels it can undermine the integrity of the judiciary, undermine or scrap human rights laws that don't serve its current political agenda, and create new laws that do. This is a dangerous place to find ourselves in. This can start to look very much like authoritarianism.""

Ahmed says that since she took up the UK directorship of Human Rights Watch three years ago, the government has launched an unprecedented attack on human rights enshrined in British and international law.

""Not only is the government talking about ripping up domestic human rights law and ignoring its international obligations, it has launched an open attack on the right to peacefully demonstrate, is locking up climate protesters, criminalising refugees and has given the police unprecedented powers over citizens,"" Ahmed said.

""This approach not only discredits and undermines our ability to hold other human rights violators to account on the international stage, but it creates a model of governance that puts political ideology over a state's legal obligation to uphold basic human rights that were put into law to protect us all. Once you attack, discredit and tear up these laws and frameworks it could be almost impossible to put them back together.""

She says that in recent weeks, attempts to stop pro-Palestinian protests "" by the former home secretary Suella Braverman and the government's attacks on the supreme court's ruling that its Rwanda asylum policy is illegal shows how emboldened the state has become in showing contempt for human rights.

""They have been successful in making us believe that ripping up human rights laws and putting new ones in place will only affect vulnerable and controversial groups,"" she said. ""But all of us, at any time, may need to exercise our rights or hold the state to account and suddenly discover that we have lost the power to do so.""","{'uri': 'theguardian.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","[{'uri': 'annie_kelly@theguardian.com', 'name': 'Annie Kelly', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': False}]",https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8185c8ace4dcd823c882792b45182b6e6ec1904b/0_60_4300_2580/master/4300.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&s=28a4be7a54c6d3f89e77ea9245333d6d,,-0.3019607843137255,25,25,The Guardian,theguardian.com

The bill is the third attempt to cure a long-running legal defect in the powers of the Australian Criminal Intelligence Commission to conduct special investigations and operations.

The bill, which was introduced on Tuesday and passed the Senate on Friday, was cited by the opposition leader, Peter Dutton, as an example of bipartisan cooperation during fierce political arguments on the unrelated issue of releases from indefinite detention.

But Greens senator David Shoebridge told the Senate the ""only credible"" explanation for the bill's urgency is if a decade's worth of ""covert warrants and surveillance is likely to have been found to be unlawful and therefore won't stand up in court"".

The designation of an investigation as ""special"" enlivens the ACIC's coercive powers to force people to produce documents or items or submit to an examination, with penalties of up to five years in prison for failure to attend and answer questions.

The focus of such investigations includes high-risk criminal targets, outlawed motorcycle gangs, criminal exploitation of the migration system, firearms trafficking, ""high risk and emerging drugs"", and national security impacts from serious and organised crime.

In December 2019 the home affairs minister, Peter Dutton, convinced Labor to support an urgent bill to retrospectively validate ACIC special investigations, over fears one target was set to win a high court case against the extraordinary powers.

In November 2022, the Albanese government passed a second bill to ""provide greater certainty"" about the ACIC board's powers to authorise special operations and investigations.

In the House of Representatives the Greens leader, Adam Bandt, said that passing retrospective legislation was ""very serious"" and queried ""has a government agency been acting in a way that is potentially unlawful"".

The attorney general, Mark Dreyfus, said the bill ensures the ACIC ""can continue to undertake its vital statutory function to combat serious and organised crime in Australia and keep the Australian community safe"".

Amendments for ""vital statutory functions"" were ""standard practice"", he said in reply to Bandt.

In the Senate, Shoebridge said the bill appeared designed ""to protect past illegal activities by these agencies, because there is no other explanation for the rush"".

""The only credible urgency is that they know the activities were illegal, and they've probably been illegal for a decade, and a whole bunch of covert warrants and surveillance is likely to have been found to be unlawful and therefore won't stand up in court,"" he said.

According to the ACIC's 2022-23 annual report, in March 2023 it withdrew a summons for a person to appear before an ACIC examiner when the person, known by the pseudonym DCL22, raised ""constitutional grounds"" in a full federal court appeal.

In February 2023 high court proceedings in a separate case were discontinued by consent, after a plaintiff known as JAM ""raised constitutional issues"" relating to charges that appeared on his AFP-issued police check.

In September 2020 Guardian Australia revealed several other instances of the ACIC quietly settling cases or withdrawing notices when the legality of its powers was challenged.

A spokesperson for Dreyfus told Guardian Australia that ""consistent with the practice of successive governments, it is necessary for the government to take steps to ensure that agencies can continue to discharge their core functions"". ""This bill does not expand ACIC's powers.""

On 14 November, Dutton said that the Coalition would support the bill ""in relation to an issue around"" the ACIC.

""Those bills pop up all the time to address quirky outcomes that the courts provide for, decisions that we can't really agree with or understand, but you can patch it up with a change to the law,"" Dutton told 2GB Radio.

The shadow attorney general, Michaelia Cash, told the Senate the bill follows ""changes commenced under the former Coalition government and continued by Labor in government"".

She said it would ""preserve the status quo and ensure that there is no legal doubt about decision-making processes undertaken by the ACIC so it can continue to combat serious and organised crime"".

Today's hot trend for policymakers is talking about artificial intelligence. This incredibly powerful technology is here to stay, and new research shows that most of us are optimistic about how generative AI will be able to improve our lives.

But there are some new and concerning threats to which policymakers must pay attention. This includes a horrific misuse of this positive tech: bad actors abusing AI to put real people in sexually explicit situations, including minors.

This criminal use of AI tools is not just reprehensible; it could destroy a person's life and dignity. There is currently a gap in the law addressing such conduct that may allow bad actors to go free, and policymakers need to address it now to ensure the culprits can be appropriately held to account.

Hundreds of laws already make illegal many of the ways bad actors can abuse AI tools. If AI is used to commit fraud, we have laws against fraud. The same is true for using AI for illegal discrimination, and the list goes on.

WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)?

Every existing law applies to AI like it does to its offline corollaries. But gaps do exist, and Americans are getting hurt.

One such gap remains when it comes to prosecuting predators handling sexually explicit images of minors. Today's laws require such images to be real, live-shot photos. But abusers are using AI tools to escape justice by claiming in court that since the sexually explicit image of a real minor is ""created by AI,"" it's not ""real,"" and thus not criminal. Unfortunately, the existing letter of the law is letting abusers escape the purposes of the law.

At the same time, other bad actors leverage AI to generate ""deepfakes"" of innocent parties in compromising, sexually explicit positions. Think of this as a modern day photoshopping of a person's head on another's body - except now, the fake is more difficult to distinguish.

Once again, the laws on this are murky at best. Harassment and defamation of character are existing ways to prosecute an offender, but since this is ""AI"" and not a real photo, a legal gap exists that must be filled.

GOP LAWMAKERS SOUND ALARM OVER AI USED TO SEXUALLY EXPLOIT CHILDREN

These holes in our laws could provide a dangerous haven for criminals, allowing them to hide behind the letter of the law while eviscerating its spirit. Thus, legislative attention is warranted and urgently needed. Lawmakers should act, not to ban or overregulate AI with a Red Tape Wishlist, but to patch these holes in our existing laws to ensure criminals can't work around them to abuse innocent people.

The first step for policymakers is to enact the Stop Deepfake CSAM Act. This simple bill updates existing child protection laws to make clear that it's illegal if a criminal uses AI to ""modify"" sexual images of children. If they are using a real child in it, even if the rest is AI generated, this is child pornography. It is illegal, and policymakers must ensure these predators go to prison.

Next is to approve the Stop Non-Consensual Distribution of Intimate Deepfake Media Act. This updates existing state privacy laws to make it clear that it is illegal to distribute AI images of an identifiable person with the intent to cause harm - addressing serious concerns about the horrific harassment of ""deepfakes.""

These changes empower law enforcement to punish bad actors using AI for nefarious purposes. This isn't to say that just making something illegal will stop it, but this is a positive step to getting recompense for harmed parties.

The pursuit of justice in the digital age must be dynamic and recognize the new dimensions AI introduces into criminal activity. This isn't merely a legislative update; it's a moral imperative.

The government must hold those who weaponize tools, including AI, against us accountable, which ensures that the digital world is an extension of our commitment to dignity, safety and justice.

The long-awaited review, released on Tuesday by attorney general, Mark Dreyfus, would also require ministerial consent to prosecute journalists who publish stories in the public interest. The proposal would also remove criminal liability from hundreds of offences.

The Human Rights Law Centre welcomed aspects of the overhaul but suggested that a proposed general secrecy law went ""too far"". It implored the attorney general to ""strike the right balance between secrecy and transparency in our democracy after a decade of opacity"".

The new catch-all provision is envisioned to address the ""gap"" exposed by the recent confidentiality breach scandal by consulting giant PwC .

Dreyfus ordered a review in December last year of the ""number, inconsistency, appropriateness and complexity of commonwealth secrecy offences"".

The number of secrecy offences had increased from 506 in 2009 to 875 in late 2022 when the Australian Law Reform Commission (ALRC) issued a report that concluded many of these offences were at odds with the then-Labor government's commitment to ""open and accountable government"".

The attorney general's department review recommends criminal liability be stripped from 168 of the 875 offences, with a further reduction expected after the introduction of the new general secrecy law.

It will also capture officials who expose ""sensitive information"" that affects the effective working of government and is considered to undermine public trust in government.

The ALRC's report did not consider ""prejudice to the effective working of government"" a strong enough reason for criminal offences but the department's review disagreed, saying it was appropriate to be captured.

The review, however, noted ""embarrassment to government"" was not a sufficient reason to pursue for criminal offences against an official.

While a general public interest case was not included in the review to avoid duplication with public interest disclosure laws, stronger rules will be introduced around public interest journalism.

Dreyfus said the Albanese government believed a ""strong and independent media is vital to democracy and holding governments to account"".

""Journalists should never face the prospect of being charged or even gaoled just for doing their jobs,"" Dreyfus said.

Kieran Pender, a senior lawyer at HRLC, said the government's commitment to press freedom and whistleblower protections was welcome but its proposed general secrecy offences went ""too far"" and were contrary to the ALRC's earlier recommendation.

Jail time for some offences was increased under the Coalition and Pender said these changes should have been reversed by the current government.

""The government's review has also refused to recalibrate secrecy offences that apply to all Australians, not just public servants, and ignores calls for a general public interest defence,"" he said.

""The government should not waste this opportunity to robustly protect transparency and press freedom, which are cornerstones of our democracy.""

The review's release follows last week's trial of army whistleblower David McBride, who pleaded guilty on Friday afternoon to three charges after the ACT supreme court upheld a commonwealth intervention to withhold key evidence.

McBride, a former military lawyer, pleaded guilty to stealing commonwealth information and giving it to journalists at the Australian Broadcasting Corporation.

The ABC subsequently used the material as the basis for an investigative series exposing war crimes in Afghanistan titled The Afghan Files.

McBride had earlier unsuccessfully attempted to use existing public interest disclosure protections to avoid prosecution but his lawyers abandoned the bid after the commonwealth moved to suppress expert evidence.

The tax office whistleblower Richard Boyle similarly attempted to use the whistleblower protections earlier this year but a South Australian judge ruled they did not cover his alleged actions.

Boyle is facing 24 charges - which he says stem from trying to collect evidence for a public interest disclosure - including taping private conversations without consent and taking photos of taxpayer information.

Last Thursday, the federal government published a discussion paper on further changes to whistleblower protections it will consider as part of its second tranche of reforms.

The proposed changes include determining whether whistleblowers should be protected for gathering evidence before disclosing possible wrongdoing.

The need for a standalone whistleblower protection authority, and a financial reward system for those coming forward, will also be considered before the end of the year.","{'uri': 'theguardian.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","[{'uri': 'sarah_basford_canales@theguardian.com', 'name': 'Sarah Basford Canales', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': False}]",https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/db01e9466afbcde498678d1a65a016b62755e7d1/888_1102_4870_2922/master/4870.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&s=e622b7555acf8494b9e134bbee5e61de,eng-9079195,-0.1529411764705882,25,25,The Guardian,theguardian.com

Three judges on the Manhattan-based 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals panel heard the professors' appeal of a ruling dismissing their claim that having an exclusive union representative, regardless of whether or not they become union members, violates their free-speech rights under the First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution.

New York and most other states have laws requiring that one union exclusively represent groups of public employees. The U.S. Supreme Court in the 1984 case Minnesota State Board for Community Colleges v. Knight upheld a Minnesota law barring anyone other than an exclusive union representative from participating in bargaining sessions.

Six City University of New York (CUNY) professors, five of whom are Jewish, sued the CUNY system and the Professional Staff Congress (PSC) last year after the union adopted a resolution condemning ""the continued subjection of Palestinians to the state-supported displacement, occupation, and use of lethal force by Israel."" The professors said they viewed the resolution as antisemitic.

U.S. District Judge Paul Engelmayer in Manhattan dismissed the case in March, saying the professors' free-speech claims were precluded by the Knight ruling.

Nathan McGrath of the Fairness Center, a nonprofit law firm that represents workers in disputes with unions, told the 2nd Circuit on Monday that Knight merely addressed who can bargain with public employers and not whether exclusive representation itself is constitutional.

McGrath said a 2018 Supreme Court ruling in Janus v. AFSCME, which held that public-sector unions cannot require non-members to pay fees to cover bargaining costs, made clear that public employees cannot be forced to support a union's speech. But Circuit Judges Guido Calabresi and Alison Nathan seemed skeptical.

""You may be right that that's what the Supreme Court had in mind, but they didn't hold it,"" Calabresi said.

McGrath maintained that Knight ""doesn't stand for the proposition that there is constitutional immunity for any type of violation that could come from the exclusive representation system.""

Nathan said that striking down exclusive representation would pose practical issues, particularly in light of Knight's bar on individual workers having a voice at the bargaining table.

The judge seemed to agree when Cleland Welton of the New York Attorney General's office, who argued for CUNY, said there would be significant variations in working conditions for professors covered by bargaining agreements and those who are not. Welton said that, for example, non-union professors could potentially be paid less.

And that, Nathan said, ""would force membership or incentivize membership in a way that would be constitutionally problematic.""

The panel also included Circuit Judge Amalya Kearse, who did not speak during the argument. All three judges are appointees of Democratic presidents.

Janus was a major victory for critics of public-sector unions, but has not had the devastating impact on union finances that some experts predicted or led to other legal setbacks for unions. Several appeals courts have rejected challenges to exclusive union representation, including claims that Janus overruled Knight.

The case is Goldstein v. Professional Staff Congress CUNY, 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, No. 23-384.

For the plaintiffs: Nathan McGrath of the Fairness Center; William Messenger of the National Right to Work Legal Defense and Education Foundation

For the union: Scott Kronland of Altshuler Berzon

For CUNY: Cleland Welton of the New York State Attorney General's office

State officials say the Michigan Department of Attorney General, Detroit Police Department, and various local law enforcement agencies conducted a statewide warrant sweep on Nov. 16.

The nine arrests were related to crimes of operating as unlicensed builders and fraud against the Michigan Unemployment Insurance Agency (UIA), Attorney General Dana Nessel said in a press release.

Authorities conducted the sweep in Ingham, Lapeer, Livingston, Macomb, Mecosta, Oakland, Roscommon, Saginaw, and Wayne counties.

Some targets of the warrant sweep remain out of custody, according to Nessel.

""When fraudsters and bad actors harm consumers and Michigan residents, we will pursue justice however and wherever needed.""

Officials say defendants were provided a bond and notice to appear by their local court.

Court dates have not yet been set.

Nessel said cases against the unlicensed builders were initiated by consumer complaints to the Department of Licensing and Regulatory Affairs (LARA) alleging failure to perform substandard work agreed to in a contract and no proof of license.

Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com.

New Hampshire should be spending at least 80% more per pupil on public schools, a judge said Monday in one of two rulings that could force significant changes to education funding.

Lawmakers have been grappling with the issue for decades after the state Supreme Court ruled in the 1990s that the state is required to provide and pay for an adequate education. In response, the Legislature began sending each school district a set amount of aid per pupil -- currently $4,100. Actual costs are much higher, however, and local property taxpayers make up the difference, with wide disparities due to differences in property wealth between communities.

JUDGE TOSSES NEW HAMPSHIRE TEACHERS UNION BID TO SHOOT DOWN VOUCHER PROGRAM

Conval Regional School District and 17 others challenged the base amount in court in 2019, and after a trial in April, Rockingham County Judge David Ruoff agreed with them Monday that the current allocation is unconstitutional. While the plaintiffs argued aid must be increased to at least $9,900 per pupil, Ruoff declined to set a definitive amount but said it should be at least $7,356.

In his order, Ruoff said while he is mindful that the Legislature has the final say, school funding is a ""complicated and politically-charged issue with a history that suggests some level of judicial intervention is now necessary."" He suggested politics have impeded the state's duty to children, but said ""that ends today.""

NEW HAMPSHIRE'S RECOVERY-FRIENDLY WORKPLACE PROGRAM EXPANDS TO NATIONWIDE INSTITUTE

In a separate case, Ruoff also found the state has violated the constitution by not redistributing excess money collected via the statewide education property tax from wealthier towns to poorer communities.

The rulings are likely to be appealed. A spokesperson for the attorney general's office, which represented the state, said officials were reviewing the orders and considering next steps.

Kimberly Rizzo Saunders, superintendent of the Conval Regional School District, said the court recognized the substantial evidence offered by plaintiffs.

Floyd, a Black man, died in May 2020 after Chauvin, a White man, pressed his knee on Floyd's neck for more than nine minutes. Video captured the scene and Floyd's gasping pleas, ""I can't breathe,"" igniting vast unrest across the nation.

Nearly a year later, a 12-member Hennepin County jury found Chauvin guilty of second-degree murder, third-degree murder and manslaughter. Chauvin was sentenced to 22½ years in prison.

This year, a Minnesota appeals court rejected Chauvin's petition for a new trial.

""This is a tragic set of circumstances that unfolded in the worst possible way over a minor inconvenience of a blocked sidewalk, and a man is dead as a result,"" said Orange County District Attorney Todd Spitzer.

The fatal incident unfolded nearly two months ago on Sept. 28 when 68-year-old Craig Sumer Elliott went out for a jog with his two dogs while pushing a pushcart on a sidewalk in the 10400 block of Katella Avenue, where he encountered the victim, 40-year-old Antonio Garcia.

Elliott allegedly used his pushcart to nudge Avalos to wake him up and get around him, according to the Orange County District Attorney. When he woke up, Avalos began yelling at Elliott to get away from him.

The 68-year-old recorded the confrontation. His video shows Avalos standing up and throwing a shoe at Elliott. In retaliation, Elliott pulled a gun from his push cart and shot Avalos three times, killing him.

Elliott had an active concealed carry with the Orange County Sheriff's Department when he allegedly shot and killed Avalos.

The Garden Grove Police Department arrested Elliott on Nov. 17. Prosecutors charged him with voluntary manslaughter with one felony enhancement of personal use of a firearm. He has since been released on a $100,000 bail.

Elliott is expected to appear in court on Dec. 15.

If convicted on all charges, he will face a maximum of 21 years in prison.","{'uri': 'cbsnews.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'CBS News'}",[],https://assets2.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2023/09/29/8c10ac86-a7f5-4a79-b6c4-422944af1b78/thumbnail/1200x630/f0b90806183009ffb0106bb4363039e8/garden-grove-shooting.jpg?v=5659e73acd91751548aa89950cf015b0,eng-9079586,-0.3960784313725491,25,25,CBS News,cbsnews.com

In a ruling on November 10, a judge concluded that Harry - along with other high-profile individuals including Sir Elton John and Baroness Doreen Lawrence - could continue their claims over alleged unlawful information gathering against Associated Newspapers (ANL).

The trio are among a group of high-profile individuals - including Sir Elton's husband David Furnish, actresses Sadie Frost and Liz Hurley and ex-MP Sir Simon Hughes - accusing the publisher of carrying out or commissioning unlawful activities such as hiring private investigators to place listening devices inside cars, ""blagging"" private records and accessing and recording private phone conversations.

Sir Elton John is part of the group bringing legal action against Associated Newspapers (Aaron Chown/PA)

ANL, which firmly denies the allegations, had asked a judge at a hearing in March to rule in its favour without a trial, arguing the legal challenges were brought ""far too late"".

But Mr Justice Nicklin ruled ANL had ""not been able to deliver a 'knockout blow' to the claims"" earlier this month.

In his 95-page-judgment, the judge said that each of the seven people in the ANL claim have a ""real prospect"" of demonstrating that ANL concealed ""relevant facts"" that would have allowed them to bring a claim against the publisher earlier.

A hearing is now due to take place on Tuesday to deal with the consequences of the judgment.

The cases remain at an early stage and ANL has yet to file a formal defence in the case which could see a third High Court trial centred on Harry's allegations of unlawful information gathering against major newspaper publishers.

Following the ruling, ANL said in a statement: ""As we have always made unequivocally clear, the lurid claims made by Prince Harry and others of phone hacking, landline tapping, burglary and sticky-window microphones are simply preposterous and we look forward to establishing this in court in due course.""

Grieving parents joined the effort Monday on Long Island to push for stricter laws.

As millions hit the roads for Thanksgiving this week, these grieving families reminded drivers the stark consequences of impaired driving and held up photos of their loved ones who will never be able to come home.

""I wouldn't wish this on anyone, seeing my son on a stretcher, knowing in every fiber of my being that he was already gone, but still hoping and praying,"" said Andrea Carpenter, whose son was killed in a crash.

Monday, Andrea and Timothy Carpenter saw firsthand the crushed Ford Escape their 22-year-old son was riding in on March 19 when a 40-year-old man, allegedly high on fentanyl, killed him with his pickup truck.

The Carpenter's son's death is among a troubling rise in traffic fatalities nationwide that prosecutors and police want to prevent with a new bill.

""The loophole in the drugged driving law needs to be closed,"" said Nassau County District Attorney Anne Donnelly.

Under the state's current law, an impaired driver can only be arrested if the officer can name the drug impairing them. But the test to identify the drug can only be administered after the arrest.

""In other words, if a person is impaired by the use of drugs, but refuses a test, law enforcement must engage in a guessing game, which of course they cannot do. So they have to release that person,"" said Suffolk County District Attorney Raymond Tierney.

New York also requires a drug to be on a public health law list to trigger a drugged driving violation, but prosecutors say the list doesn't keep pace with the proliferation of rapidly changing synthetic drugs.

""It is long overdue for New York state to resolve issues in the law that make it hard to successfully gather critical evidence in these cases. This deprives victims of justice,"" said Alisa McMorris, whose son was killed in a DWI crash.

Without a change, these families say dangerous criminals will stay on the road.

The families said they will head to Albany on Jan. 9 to push for the bill's passage.","{'uri': 'cbsnews.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'CBS News'}",[],https://assets1.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2023/11/20/0006e661-d687-4ae0-93be-eb8a8da3716f/thumbnail/1200x630/771f5d35808614d1fdd146550d4dcfe4/new-fan-6p-pkg-li-drivi-wcbs8i7m-hi-res-still.jpg?v=5659e73acd91751548aa89950cf015b0,,-0.3490196078431372,25,25,CBS News,cbsnews.com

Please try again later{{ /verifyErrors }}

State authorities were investigating Monday after a California Highway Patrol officer shot and killed a man over the weekend in the middle of a Los Angeles area freeway during a struggle recorded on video.

Sunday afternoon's deadly encounter occurred after the highway patrol responded to multiple calls of a male pedestrian walking in westbound lanes of Interstate 105 in south LA County, the agency said in a statement. All traffic in that direction was temporarily blocked.

""During the contact with the pedestrian, a struggle ensued and an officer involved shooting occurred,"" the statement said.

The Los Angeles County medical examiner's office confirmed the person died but did not provide identification, pending notification of family. A cause of death was not immediately released.

The highway patrol referred inquiries about the investigation to the California Department of Justice, which typically investigates fatal police shootings. The justice department confirmed it was investigating, but provided no additional details.

A minute-long video recorded by a bystander and posted on social media begins with an officer on top of another person as the two grapple in the middle of a closed stretch of freeway. It was not clear who took the original video.

As they struggle, a shot is fired and the officer suddenly jumps to his feet while the other man goes limp on the pavement. The officer immediately fires at least four shots at the prone man, the video shows. For the remainder of the clip, the officer keeps his gun drawn while the man lies motionless.

Ed Obayashi, a use-of-force expert who investigates police shootings for law enforcement agencies in California, cautioned against jumping to conclusions from the video alone.

Obayashi said investigators will want to know why the officer approached the pedestrian without a partner or other backup nearby. ""They were able to close the freeway, so presumably there was law enforcement in the area,"" he said.

Obayashi said the investigation will focus on whether the man was armed and why the officer felt the need to shoot after standing up and disengaging from the fight.

""Was there a knife? Or a stun gun?"" Obayashi said investigators will ask. ""We don't know what kind of threat this officer perceived.""","{'uri': 'independent.co.uk', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'The Independent'}",[],https://static.independent.co.uk/2023/11/20/22/California_Highway_Patrol_Shooting_38061.jpg?quality=75&width=1200&auto=webp,eng-9078791,-0.2549019607843137,25,25,The Independent,independent.co.uk

DuPont had asked the high court in June to review the case, saying its defense was hamstrung during Travis Abbott's 2020 trial.

The company said Abbott's case is unique, as are the thousands of lawsuits alleging that a West Virginia DuPont plant discharged cancer-causing Perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) into the Ohio River consolidated in multidistrict litigation (MDL) in Ohio federal court. DuPont claimed a lower court improperly restricted it from contesting findings that it negligently exposed people to PFOA from lawsuits that were tried earlier as test trials, or ""bellwethers.""

Doing so kept the company from mounting a defense that key elements of the cases are different, including specifics of Abbott's PFOA exposure, it said.

The company had asked the justices to determine the court cannot make the results from bellwether trials binding on the company in every other case within the MDL.

As is customary, the court's order was issued without further explanation.

DuPont did not immediately respond to a request for comment. An attorney for Abbott said they are pleased with the court's decision.

PFOA is among a class of chemicals called per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances, or PFAS, that are used in wide range of products including non-stick cookware and firefighting foams, and are associated with certain cancers, hormonal dysfunction and other diseases.

They are referred to as ""forever chemicals"" because they don't easily break down in the human body or nature.

The company appealed Abbott's trial victory to the 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in 2021, arguing the bellwethers were never intended to be representative of every case in the MDL, many of which have settled.

DuPont argued Abbott's circumstances were much different from the plaintiffs in the bellwether trials. For example, his water wells were up to 56 miles away from the plant, while two of the bellwether plaintiffs got water less than a mile away. Those differences could have convinced a jury Abbott's injuries were not reasonably foreseeable to DuPont.

The 6th Circuit upheld the lower court's decision, finding it was right to conclude that DuPont's behavior impacted the plaintiffs in virtually identical ways, so it was appropriate to bar the company from relitigating arguments it had repeatedly lost before.

Dissenting from the high court's decision not to grant review, Justice Clarence Thomas said Monday the bellwether trials were not meant to be representative of all the cases in the multidistrict litigation, and DuPont should not have been barred from contesting elements of negligence found in those earlier cases.

Justice Brett Kavanaugh said he would have heard the case.

The case is E.I. du Pont de Nemours & Co v. Abbott, U.S. Supreme Court, No. 23-13.

Patricia Martin, 64, was indicted on Nov. 9 on three counts of theft, two counts of financial exploitation of an elderly person, one count of money laundering, and one count of financial institution fraud.

According to the indictment, the thefts happened between December 2020 and October 2022. She's accused of moving money from her uncle Oscar Wilkerson's bank accounts to at least two other accounts in an effort to cover up the thefts, and used the money for cryptocurrency investments in her own name.

The Illinois Supreme Court disbarred Martin in September, after she previously admitted to misconduct.

""She intentionally used for her own purposes more than $240,000 she had agreed to hold for an elderly relative who was residing in a nursing home, made false statements to the physician who held her relative's power of attorney about the balances in his bank and investment accounts, and did not produce documents in response to an ARDC subpoena,"" according to the court's Attorney Registration and Disciplinary Commission.

She had been licensed to practice law in Illinois since 1986 before the state's highest court stripped her of her license in September.

CBS 2's Chris Tye first broke the story about Martin's conduct.

Martin, who spent 24 years on the bench, retired as Cook County's top juvenile court judge in 2020.

Around the same time, the Illinois Supreme Court - which investigates attorney misbehavior - alleges that as her uncle's power of attorney, Martin ""used at least $246,203.80 of... funds without his authority for her own personal purposes.""

""If you can't trust a judge, who can you trust?"" said Ken Rapier, a friend of Martin's uncle, Oscar Wilkerson, a former Tuskegee Airman who died in February. ""It really upsets me when somebody takes advantage of the Tuskegee Airmen.""

Five months before he died, Wilkerson - who lived his final days at a south suburban retirement center - sued Martin.

The lawsuit accused Martin of stealing hundreds of thousands of dollars from Wilkerson and converting it into ""cryptocurrency that she held in her own name and over which she maintained exclusive control.""

Due to her ""continued unresponsiveness"" to court hearings and orders, a judge ordered Martin to pay three times as much - $1.1 million dollars - to Wilkerson's estate.

Along the way, court rulings indicate Judge Martin failed to show up and follow court orders - which led to an investigation by Cook County State's Attorney Kim Foxx's office.

Martin has owned since owned up to misconduct.

In an affidavit obtained by CBS 2, Martin acknowledged ""the evidence would clearly and convincingly establish the facts and conclusions of misconduct.""

CBS 2 Legal Analyst Irv Miller called Martin's admission a massive fall from grace.

""It's going to shake the entire Circuit Court of Cook County,"" he said. ""She's agreeing that the evidence against her clearly - and she uses the word 'clearly' - establishes that she committed misconduct in this particular case.""

Despite that admission, Martin has argued she shouldn't have to pay the $1.1 million to Wilkerson's estate, since her uncle is now dead.

""The plaintiff's death,"" her lawyer wrote, ""suspend[s] the court's jurisdiction"" in this matter.

""They're making a technical argument - frankly, it may have merit - that because the plaintiff died while this proceeding was pending, there is no proper plaintiff - and if there is no proper plaintiff, the lawsuit can't proceed,"" Miller said.

In July, Cook County prosecutors charged Martin with criminal contempt of court related to court orders - as recently as this April - where the court ordered Martin ""not to move funds of Oscar Wilkerson.""

Regardless, prosecutors say, Judge Martin kept moving funds - $598 here, $277 there - and more and more. Prosecutors say Martin transferred much of the money to Bitcoin, and they say have the receipts they say prove it.

""Even if you're a former judge, you cannot thumb your nose at a court order - and that's what the current judge hearing the case has indicated occurred in this case,"" Miller said, ""and that's why she was pretty upset about it.""

Martin made her first appearance on the theft and money laundering charges on Friday, and is due back in court in Bridgeview on Dec. 20. She was allowed to remain free as she awaits trial.","{'uri': 'cbsnews.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'CBS News'}",[],https://assets1.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2023/07/31/0f96449b-4e02-46bd-8c1a-fab960a3e827/thumbnail/1200x630/ec8398844559a3580c7c8f2f95c3c052/judge-patricia-martin.jpg?v=5659e73acd91751548aa89950cf015b0,,-0.1137254901960785,25,25,CBS News,cbsnews.com

He was also named in a report that alleges racist and antisemitic language from police leaders.

On Monday, both the mayor and police department of a New Jersey township were accused of abuse of power in unrelated incidents that saw the city's top official criminally charged and the state attorney general recommending the ouster of the police chief and a sergeant.

Sal Bonaccorso, 63, who has been the mayor of Clark since 2001 and came under fire a year ago when he was secretly recorded using racist language, is accused of falsifying records to benefit his landscaping company.

State officials say the Office of Public Integrity and Accountability determined that Bonaccorso ran his underground tank-removal business, Bonaccorso & Son LLC, out of his township office and used municipal resources. He is accused of using township equipment including computers and fax machines, and directing township workers ""solely for the purpose of running his private business,"" according to a statement.

""Any elected leader who abuses his power and position and misuses public property and public employees for his own benefit, at taxpayers' expense, betrays the public's trust,"" New Jersey Attorney General Matthew J. Platkin said in a statement.

The mayor has been charged with second-degree misconduct, third-degree tampering with public records or information, third-degree witness tampering, fourth-degree forgery and fourth-degree falsifying or tampering with records, the AG said.

Bonaccorso could not be reached for comment Monday afternoon.

Clark, a town of 15,200 about 13 miles south of Newark, is about 90 percent white and 2 percent of its residents are Black. The 4.3-square-mile community of well-manicured lawns and comfortable homes has a median income of about $114,000, according to the U.S. Census Bureau.

The AG on Monday also detailed the results of a separate investigation involving Clark's police department and alleged racist, sexist and antisemitic behavior in a withering 43-page report.

The mayor, Police Chief Pedro Matos and Sgt. Joseph Teston, who leads the internal affairs unit, allegedly used problematic language while discussing hiring practices, the AG's report said.

Platkin is recommending Matos and Teston be fired.

Matos and Teston could not be reached for comment Monday afternoon.

Matos routinely failed to forward allegations of wrongdoing to the county prosecutor's office and ""violated the standard of conduct related to derogatory comments, and failed to conduct internal affairs investigations,"" according to a statement.

The Union County prosecutor's and the state's Attorney General's Office office took over Clark's police department in July 2020 amid misconduct allegations. The state attorney general promised a public report on the problems there, NBC New York reported.

Teston violated the standard of conduct for derogatory comments and failed to conduct internal affairs investigations, Platkin said.

He was also arrested in 2022 outside a professional sports arena in New York, the AG's Office said. The charges were ultimately dropped, but Teston admitted to striking an unarmed person with a glass bottle and fleeing.

Platkin's recommendations for termination of the officers are not binding, a statement said.

In 2022, audio recordings surfaced capturing Bonaccorso using profanity and racist language, thrusting the mayor and his small town into the national spotlight. Bonaccorso resisted calls to resign. He apologized in April 2022.

Wilkinson Stekloff is among the ""boutique"" law firms that typically pay higher bonuses than bigger firms. New York law firm Milbank, the only large U.S. law firm to publicly announce annual bonus figures so far this year, said earlier this month that it will hand out bonuses ranging from $15,000 to $115,000 based on seniority.

Bonuses for first-year associates at Wilkinson Stekloff will start at $26,250 and increase by class year, according to a Monday internal email viewed by Reuters. The firm will pay out the bonuses by Dec. 15.

""We are delighted to recognize the phenomenal contributions our associates make to the success of our clients and the firm,"" Wilkinson Stekloff said in a statement.

The firm's website lists 23 associates. There are also four counsel, who according to the internal email will hear about their bonuses separately.

Wilkinson Stekloff's partners said in the internal email that it was an ""extraordinary and unprecedented year,"" and it had five separate cases go to trial, a record for the firm.

Milbank announced its bonuses for associates on Nov. 7, alongside a new higher base salary scale ranging from $225,000 for its most junior lawyers up to $425,000 for eighth-year associates. Milbank's bonus amounts are the same as it gave out last year.

The country's biggest law firms typically adjust their salary scales within days or weeks of one another to remain competitive. No other large firm has yet publicly matched or exceeded Milbank's salary scale, and are likely waiting to see what peer firms do.","{'uri': 'reuters.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'Reuters'}","[{'uri': 'sara_merken@reuters.com', 'name': 'Sara Merken', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': False}]",https://www.reuters.com/resizer/2xggDnmCmv5HEkLz7Bwi6weTziY=/728x381/smart/filters:quality(80)/cloudfront-us-east-2.images.arcpublishing.com/reuters/E33YGNVLEZKEXDIIGKY7OSGIGM.jpg,,0.5215686274509803,25,25,Reuters,reuters.com

It comes after an investigation into racial slurs allegedly made by Mayor Salvator Bonaccorso.

""While acting in his official capacity as mayor, Bonaccorso operated his landscaping and illegal tank removal business out of his township office, utilizing municipal resources including township provided faxes, printers and computers to run the company,"" said Platkin.

Bonaccorso, 63, is also charged with witness tampering and falsifying records.

""Fraudulently used an engineer's name, license number and forged signature on permit applications submitted to municipalities for tank removals,"" said Platkin.

When CBS New York reached out to Clark Township, a spokesperson for Bonaccorso said he had no comment. We also tried to get a comment at the mayor's residence, but no one answered the door.

""If a mayor or someone or politician is doing illegal things, then they should resign,"" said Debbie Flanagan, a Clark resident.

""Clark is very good, a good place. And [Bonaccorso] made it better than the mayor before him,"" a Clark resident said before the charges were announced.

Platkin said the criminal charges came as a result of another investigation into the police department, its chief and claims of racist comments made by the mayor at another official. It led to a 43-page report alleging racially-motivated arrests as well as failure to investigate allegations of misconduct.

""As a percentage of the population, Black individuals were arrested at a disproportionate rate,"" said Platkin.

The Rwanda scheme is 'doomed to fail' if Britain remains in the European Convention on Human Rights, a report warned last night.

As Rishi Sunak faced a battle within Cabinet over emergency legislation to start removal flights, an expert urged him to quit the international human rights treaty.

Mr Sunak has repeated his vow to do 'whatever necessary' to get the £140million scheme off the ground after it was ruled unlawful by the Supreme Court last week.

As long as the UK remains in the treaty there will be legal challenges causing further delays in implementing the scheme, the paper by barrister and European law expert Martin Howe said.

'Leaving the EU was supposed to give us back control of our borders. But we won't get back control until we leave the ECHR as well,' Mr Howe said.

The document, published by the Centre for Brexit Policy, said Britain should give its 'intention to quit' the ECHR and the Strasbourg court which oversees implementation of the treaty.

Mr Howe added: 'Even if the UK courts allow removals to Rwanda to go ahead, migrants' lawyers can then make direct petitions to the Strasbourg court. It is doomed to fail.'

It comes as details of the new Rwanda asylum laws were accidentally revealed outside No10 yesterday.

Officials were snapped by photographers as they carried papers that appeared to be draft versions of the emergency legislation pledged by Mr Sunak.

It revealed the proposed name of the law as the Asylum (Removal to Rwanda) Bill.

A visible summary said it would set out measures 'requiring the removal to Rwanda of asylum seekers'.

The 2-1 decision by a panel of the 8th Circuit Court of Appeals based in St. Louis found that only the U.S. attorney general can enforce Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act, which prohibits discriminatory voting practices such as racially gerrymandered districts.

The majority said other federal laws, including the 1964 Civil Rights Act, make it clear when private groups can sue said but similar wording is not found in the voting law.

""When those details are missing, it is not our place to fill in the gaps, except when 'text and structure´ require it,"" U.S. Circuit Judge David R. Stras wrote for the majority in an opinion joined by Judge Raymond W. Gruender. Stras was nominated by former President Donald Trump and Gruender by former President George W. Bush.

The decision affirmed a lower judge´s decision to dismiss a case brought by the Arkansas State Conference NAACP and the Arkansas Public Policy Panel after giving U.S. Attorney General Merrick B. Garland five days to join the lawsuit. Neither organization immediately returned messages seeking comment Monday.

Chief Judge Lavenski R. Smith noted in a dissenting opinion that federal courts across the country and the U.S. Supreme Court have considered numerous cases brought by private plaintiffs under Section 2. Smith said the court should follow ""existing precedent that permits a judicial remedy"" unless the Supreme Court or Congress decides differently.

""Rights so foundational to self-government and citizenship should not depend solely on the discretion or availability of the government´s agents for protection,"" wrote Smith, another appointee of George W. Bush.

The ruling applies only to federal courts covered by the 8th Circuit, which includes Arkansas, Iowa, Minnesota, Missouri, Nebraska, North Dakota and South Dakota. Meanwhile, several pending lawsuits by private groups challenge various political maps drawn by legislators across the country.

A representative for the Justice Department declined to comment.

It's not the final word on the 14th Amendment.

We now have arguably the most important 14th Amendment ruling about Donald Trump to date. Friday's decision from Colorado isn't entirely convincing, but its most useful feature may be that it lays the groundwork for the U.S. Supreme Court to weigh in.

Colorado District Judge Sarah Wallace found in her lengthy opinion that Trump engaged in insurrection. That might lead one to think that Trump is therefore barred from the presidency under the Constitution's insurrection clause. But Wallace also said the president isn't an ""officer"" under the provision in question, so, according to the Colorado state judge, Trump isn't banned from the presidency despite his otherwise unconstitutional behavior. My colleague Hayes Brown explained why it's a dubious distinction on Wallace's part.

But the state trial judge won't have the last word. Importantly, unlike other courts that have punted on the subject recently, Wallace issued an actual ruling, based on facts and evidence, even if her conclusion is wanting. On that note, the Colorado challengers are attacking the ""officer"" distinction on appeal to the state's Supreme Court. If they're successful in doing so -- leading to a ruling that Trump is ineligible -- then the U.S. Supreme Court will more likely step in to make a definitive, nationwide ruling.

The U.S. justices have discretion over their docket, but they'll be more likely to review a decision that keeps Trump off the ballot; if a lower federal court or state high court says he can stay on the ballot, then the justices can maintain the status quo by simply rejecting any appeals of such decisions and declining to get involved.

But if the Colorado Supreme Court endorses her insurrection finding yet disagrees with her ""officer"" rationale on legal grounds, then Wallace's decision may have been the first step in the issue's judicial resolution.","{'uri': 'msnbc.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'MSNBC.com'}",[],"https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_nbcnews-fp-1024-512,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2023-11/231120-donald-trump-jm-1433-bd1a4b.jpg",eng-9075414,0.1843137254901961,25,25,MSNBC.com,msnbc.com

Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com.

Michigan Democrats who have transformed gun laws in the state in the wake of multiple mass school shootings are now making it more difficult for individuals with convictions for misdemeanor domestic violence from gaining access to guns.

Gov. Gretchen Whitmer signed legislation Monday that prohibits individuals convicted of a misdemeanor related to domestic violence from possessing firearms for at least an eight-year-period. State law currently includes firearm restrictions for those with felonies related to domestic abuse, but no law had existed for misdemeanor domestic violence.

""These bills are based on a simple idea: if you have been found guilty in court for violently assaulting your partner, you should not be able to access a deadly weapon that you could use to further threatened, harm or kill them."" Whitmer said at a bill signing in Kalamazoo. ""It's just common sense.""

MICHIGAN DEMS, GRETCHEN WHITMER ARE PURSUING A GREEN NEW DEAL, THREATENING FUTURE GRID STABILITY

MICHIGAN JURY ACQUITS 3 MEN IN PLOT TO KIDNAP GOV. GRETCHEN WHITMER

The eight-year ban for misdemeanor domestic violence convictions is only the latest firearm restriction added to Michigan law since Democrats took control of both chambers of the state Legislature and retained the governor's office last election.

Legislation implementing red flag laws, stricter background checks and safe storage requirements were all signed by Whitmer earlier this year. The overhauled gun laws follow two deadly mass school shootings that happened in Michigan within a 14-month period.

Democratic State Sen. Stephanie Chang, a lead sponsor of the bill package, said Monday that the latest legislation would put Michigan in line with similar laws in 31 other states and the District of Columbia.

Federal law already prohibits those charged with felonies or misdemeanors related to domestic violence from purchasing or possessing a gun. But advocates have pushed for state-level laws that they say can be better enforced and won't be threatened by future Supreme Court rulings.

Earlier this month, the Supreme Court took up a challenge to a federal law that prohibits people from having guns if they are under a court order to stay away from their spouse, partner or other family members. The nation's high court heard arguments on Nov. 7 and seemed likely to preserve the federal law.

""As the Supreme Court weighs whether to uphold common-sense laws to disarm domestic abusers, Governor Whitmer and the Michigan legislature are taking a clear stand: If you have a history of intimate partner violence, you have no business owning a gun,"" John Feinblatt, president of Everytown for Gun Safety, said in a statement.

Firearms are the most common weapon used in homicides of spouses, intimate partners, children or relatives in recent years, according to data from the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Guns were used in more than half, 57%, of those killings in 2020, a year that saw an overall increase in domestic violence during the coronavirus pandemic.

Under the legislation signed Monday in Michigan, people convicted of a misdemeanor that involved domestic violence will be not allowed to purchase, possess, or use a firearm or ammunition until they have completed the terms of imprisonment, paid all fines and eight years had passed.

The parents of Maggie Wardle, a 19-year-old shot and killed by an ex-boyfriend at Kalamazoo College in 1999, spoke in support of the legislation at Monday's signing.

""This law, now passed and signed into law today, will save someone's life and give them the chance to live a full meaningful life, the chance Maggie did not get,"" Rick Omillian, Maggie's stepfather, said Monday.","{'uri': 'foxnews.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'Fox News'}",[],https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2023/11/Gretchen-Whitmer.gif,eng-9078389,-0.3568627450980392,25,25,Fox News,foxnews.com

That concern led the 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals last week to undo the certification of five statewide classes of Ford (F.N) pickup owners who claimed that their trucks' braking systems were defectively designed. Judges Danny Boggs, Amul Thapar and Chad Readler said in a per curiam opinion that the trial judge, U.S. District Judge Gershwin Drain of Detroit, abused his discretion by failing to explain why class allegations could be evaluated in a single proceeding.

Specifically, the 6th Circuit held that Drain did not provide sufficient analysis on commonality, one of the threshold requirements for class certification under Rule 23 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.

The trial judge had certified only issues classes, rather than classes seeking money damages, in order to eliminate individual questions about reliance and timeliness. He also avoided variations in state consumers laws by certifying different issue classes for pickup owners in different states.

But the judge was nevertheless obliged, the 6th Circuit said, to explain why there is only one classwide answer to the questions of whether Ford's brake system was defective, whether Ford knew about the defects, and whether the allegedly concealed information would have been important to pickup truck purchasers.

Ford, which is represented by Dykema Gossett, Bush Seyferth and O'Melveny & Myers, declined to comment on the ruling.

Plaintiffs lawyers from DiCello Levitt; The Miller Law Firm; Beasley, Allen, Crow, Methvin, Portis & Miles; and Lieff Cabraser Heimann & Bernstein said via email that they are confident the issue classes will be recertified on remand to Drain, the trial judge.

""The element of commonality is supported by the law and the facts,"" said Powell Miller of the Miller firm.

Drain certified five statewide classes (from Alabama, California, Florida, Georgia and Texas) to determine if a Hitachi-made component of the braking system led to defects. The judge dedicated only a few paragraphs to the commonality requirement, concluding that all of the class claims arose from the same alleged defect.

Even though the issue class would not definitively establish Ford's liability to each class member, Drain said, a jury trial on the alleged defect and Ford's knowledge of it would go a long way toward resolving the case.

""If the jury concludes there is no defect or that the defect is not material, plaintiffs' claims fail,"" the trial judge said. ""Conversely, if the jury finds there is a material defect then the scope of subsequent trials will be narrowed significantly.""

Ford argued in its petition for interlocutory review of Drain's ruling that the issue is not nearly as simple as Drain's analysis suggested. Ford said there were several changes to the design and manufacturing process for the allegedly problematic part over the long class period. It also insisted that its knowledge of the alleged defect changed over that time period.

So, according to Ford, Drain framed the commonality question incorrectly. Under the U.S. Supreme Court's 2011 decision in Wal-Mart Stores Inc. v. Dukes, Ford said, class certification depends not on whether a jury might find a single answer to the design defect question but whether the question can only have one answer.

""Plaintiffs must show that a reasonable jury would have to answer the question the same for every class member,"" Ford said. ""If, based on the evidence, a reasonable jury could answer the question differently for different class members, the question cannot be 'common to the class' for purposes of Rule 23.""

Plaintiffs lawyers responded that the trial judge did, in fact, consider -- and reject -- Ford's arguments about variations across model years in the allegedly defective Hitachi [RIC:RIC:HITCHG.UL] parts. According to class counsel, Drain determined that any variations were too inconsequential to divert from the classwide issue of whether the brake system was defective.

The 6th Circuit, though, sided with Ford. The design defect question is only appropriate for a classwide resolution, the appeals court said, ""if the same malfunction could have corrupted the brake cylinders of all the relevant F-150 model years.""

It may be that modifications to the allegedly problematic part were too minor to bar classwide resolution of the defect question, the 6th Circuit said. The court said it may also be of no consequence that plaintiffs are alleging two distinct theories for how the purported defect affected the braking system. But the trial judge simply did not provide assurances that he took these considerations into account, the appeals court said.

""That analysis is all but absent,"" the opinion said. ""All we have is the summary conclusion.""

Ford had asked the court to rule that the trial judge erroneously viewed the evidence in the light most favorable to the plaintiffs in reaching his decision on class certification. The 6th Circuit did not go as far as that, but said Drain, on remand, ""must evaluate whether each of the four Rule 23(a) factors is actually satisfied, not merely that the factors are properly alleged.""

The appeals court did not reach Ford's alternative argument that plaintiffs failed to meet Rule 23's superiority requirement because they hadn't shown issue classes to be the most efficient way to resolve the dispute. The plaintiffs countered that the 6th Circuit has already joined other circuits in holding that issue classes are a superior means of resolving claims when plaintiffs otherwise meet Rule 23's threshold requirements.","{'uri': 'reuters.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'Reuters'}","[{'uri': 'alison_frankel@reuters.com', 'name': 'Alison Frankel', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': False}]",https://www.reuters.com/resizer/KRihzwdclm1LsqwjyTZZwQAz50U=/728x381/smart/filters:quality(80)/cloudfront-us-east-2.images.arcpublishing.com/reuters/MQNQLXLITNM5ZBYI7ITXLKAZ3M.jpg,,-0.3019607843137255,25,25,Reuters,reuters.com

He couldn't be more wrong,"The latest opinion denying a challenge to Donald Trump's eligibility to run for president has occasioned a lot of teeth-gnashing about how the court, in the words of Colorado's secretary of state, gave Trump a ""get-out-of-jail-free card for insurrection."" The frustration is understandable but shortsighted.

In fact, the opinion by Colorado District Judge Sarah B. Wallace is a giant step toward disqualifying Trump from the ballot on constitutional grounds.

The Colorado challenge is one of several brought under Section 3 of the 14th Amendment, which disqualifies officials who ""have engaged in insurrection"" against the United States from holding federal office. The provision gives rise to the argument that Trump is not qualified to run for president because of his role in the events of Jan. 6, 2021.

In the last few of its 102 pages, Wallace's opinion concludes that the president is not ""an officer of the United States"" for the purposes of the amendment and is therefore not disqualified from the ballot. Trump hailed this as ""a gigantic court victory.""

But the former president was either bluffing or being obtuse. In fact, the opinion goes nine-tenths of the way toward recognizing the challengers' claim and disqualifying Trump before opting for a close and questionable textual reading on the officer question. The ruling is far more important for how it goes against Trump than for the court's final change of direction.

Every other court that has taken up the 14th Amendment claim to date has shied away from adjudicating it on the merits, finding it was a political question or otherwise unsuited for determination by the courts. The Colorado judge, by contrast, held a week-long evidentiary hearing, taking testimony on the law and the facts.

Wallace's resulting opinion works methodically through the evidence to determine that Trump did indeed engage in insurrection, which only a trial court can do. In the process, she rejected Trump's 1st Amendment defense, finding that his intentional incitement of the Jan. 6 marauders overcame any free-speech claim.

The order that will be appealed to higher courts thus has nearly everything that would be needed to disqualify Trump from the ballot. Its final flinch on whether the president is an officer is a discrete question of textual interpretation that any appellate court could decide differently.

The challengers' brief, in fact, treated the officer issue almost as an afterthought, though a subsequent Wall Street Journal op-ed by former Atty. Gen. Michael Mukasey brought new attention to the question. And the conclusion that the president is not an officer has drawn ferocious criticism from eminent scholars, including the conservative former appellate Judge J. Michael Luttig, who called it ""unfathomable.""

However weak or strong the claim -- I don't think it's as ridiculous as others contend -- the important point is that higher courts will decide it as a question of law. They may well disagree with Wallace on that point while adopting her far more important finding that Trump engaged in insurrection.

It's widely assumed that any appellate ruling disqualifying Trump from the ballot would prompt intervention by the U.S. Supreme Court, which would have the final say. And it's hard to imagine that the Supreme Court could or would make the determination that Trump engaged in insurrection without a factual record to review. In that way, Wallace's opinion sets what had been an empty table for the court.

Of course, appellate courts could agree with Wallace on the officer question or differ with her on other legal grounds. A higher court could, for example, reject Wallace's definition of insurrection as ""any public use of force or threat of force by a group of people to hinder or prevent the execution of law"" -- an expansive definition based on a historical analysis of the term's meaning during Reconstruction, when the 14th Amendment was adopted. Higher courts could also hold that enforcement of Section 3 is a political question that only Congress can answer, though that would raise other questions about the states' power to ensure candidates meet other basic qualifications for the ballot.

The bottom line, however, is that the Colorado opinion gives the challengers what they needed most -- a determination that Trump engaged in insurrection -- while raising legal questions that the higher courts would have had to answer in any case. It thereby breathes new life into a potential legal solution to the Trump nightmare that might otherwise have remained quixotic.","{'uri': 'latimes.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'Los Angeles Times'}",[],https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/f0cb706/2147483647/strip/true/crop/4887x2749+0+255/resize/1200x675!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F69%2Fc5%2Fd45cdad6421688e499d435511c09%2Felection-2024-trump-insurrection-amendment-01177.jpg,eng-9075414,0.07450980392156858,25,25,Los Angeles Times,latimes.com

QUITTING the European Court of Human Rights is the only way to revive the Rwanda plan, Rishi Sunak has been told.

The PM's deportation scheme is doomed to fail as long as Britain is beholden to meddling judges in Strasbourg, a report says.

The Centre for Brexit Policy insists his emergency legislation after last week's Supreme Court defeat will not make the government immune to challenges on ECHR grounds.

Barrister Martin Howe has warned: ""The Rwanda removal scheme is still left vulnerable to ECHR-based legal challenges in the UK courts.

""There will be challenges based on individual circumstances even if emergency legislation reverses the effect of the Supreme Court decision, unless that emergency legislation is drafted to exclude those individual challenges as well.""

He also vowed to ignore ECHR so-called ""pyjama injunctions"" where anonymous Strasbourg judges scupper removal flights at the last minute.

In his report Mr Howe says the Euro court now actively ""subverts"" its original aim of protecting human rights.

He said: ""The Strasbourg Court has transformed it into something completely different, by acting effectively as a law-making body rather than sticking to its allotted task of interpreting the text which was agreed by the founding states.""

A new treaty with Rwanda will also be signed in the coming days to plug the holes raised by the Supreme Court around refugee safety.","{'uri': 'thesun.co.uk', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'The Sun'}","[{'uri': 'jack_elsom@thesun.co.uk', 'name': 'Jack Elsom', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': False}]",https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/SUNEXCL_gettyimages-457191852jpg-JS245706403-1.jpg?strip=all&quality=100&w=1920&h=1080&crop=1,eng-9074973,0.09019607843137245,25,25,The Sun,thesun.co.uk

Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com.

New York's highest court on Monday upheld a New York City law that forbids police from using chokeholds or compressing a person's diaphragm during an arrest, rejecting a challenge from police unions to a law passed after the death of George Floyd.

The New York Court of Appeals, in a unanimous decision, ruled that the law is clear in its language and that it does not conflict with an existing state law that bans police from using chokes.

The city's law came as governments across the country prohibited or severely limited the use of chokeholds or similar restraints by police following Floyd's death in 2020, which occurred as a Minneapolis police officer kneeled on his neck for several minutes.

NYC TO CUT OVERTIME PAY FOR POLICE DESPITE BEING UNDERSTAFFED BY 'THOUSANDS'

The Police Benevolent Association of the City of New York, along with other law enforcement unions, sued the city over its law and have argued that its language is vague as to what officers are allowed to do during an arrest. In a statement, John Nuthall, a spokesman for the Police Benevolent Association of the City of New York, said the ruling will provide clarity to officers.

""While this is not the outcome we had hoped for, the Court's decision is a victory insofar that it will provide our officers with greater certainty when it comes to the statute, because under this Court's decision, it must be proven at a minimum that an officer's action in fact 'impedes the person's ability to breathe,' was 'not accidental,' and was not a 'justifiable use of physical force,'"" Nuthall said.

The New York Police Department has long barred its officers from using chokeholds to subdue people. New York state also has a law banning police chokeholds that was named after Eric Garner, who was killed when a New York Police Department officer placed him in a chokehold in 2014.

The city's law, while banning chokes, also includes a provision that forbids officers from compressing a person's diaphragm. Such a compression, though kneeling, sitting or standing on a person's chest or back, can make it difficult to breathe.","{'uri': 'foxnews.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'Fox News'}",[],https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2023/11/New-York-Protest.gif,eng-9078194,-0.0980392156862745,25,25,Fox News,foxnews.com

The former US president’s legal team has signalled that it will fight any restrictions to the Supreme Court

A federal appeal court appeared inclined on Monday to reimpose at least some restrictions on Donald Trump’s speech in his landmark election subversion case. But the judges wrestled with how to craft a gag order that does not infringe on the former president’s free speech rights or prevent him from defending himself on the campaign trail.

The three judges on the panel asked sceptical and at times aggressive questions of lawyers on both sides while weighing whether to put back in place an order from a trial judge that barred Trump from inflammatory comments against prosecutors, potential witnesses and court staff.

The judges raised a litany of hypothetical scenarios that could arise in the months ahead as they considered how to fashion a balance between an order that protects Trump’s First Amendment rights and the need to protect “the criminal trial process and its integrity and its truth finding function.”

“There’s a balance that has to be undertaken here, and it’s a very difficult balance in this context,” Judge Patricia Millett told Cecil VanDevender, a lawyer with special counsel Jack Smith’s office. “But we have to use a careful scalpel here and not step into really sort of skewing the political arena, don’t we?”

VanDevender replied that he agreed but said he believed that the gag order imposed last month does strike the appropriate balance

The court did not immediately rule but its questions left open the possibility that it might narrow the gag order, setting parameters on what Trump, as both a criminal defendant and the leading candidate for the 2024 Republican presidential nomination, can and cannot say as the trial date nears. Trump’s team has signalled that it will fight any restrictions to the Supreme Court.

No matter the outcome, the stakes are high given the volume and intensity of Trump’s public comments about the case, the massive public platform he holds on social media and the campaign trail, and the limited legal precedent for restricting speech of political candidates – let alone for the White House – who are criminal defendants.

In a sign of the argument’s import, special counsel Smith himself attended, sitting in the front row of the courtroom in a building just blocks from the US Capitol stormed on January 6, 2021, by rioters motivated by Trump’s false claims about the election he lost to Democrat Joe Biden.

Monday’s arguments spanned nearly two-and-a-half hours, with Trump lawyer D John Sauer fielding most of the questions as he pressed his case that the gag order was too vague and an unconstitutional muzzling.

“The order is unprecedented, and it sets a terrible precedent for future restrictions on core political speech,” Sauer said. He described it as a “heckler’s veto,” unfairly relying on the theory that Trump’s speech might someday inspire other people to harass or intimidate his targets.

“They can’t draw a causal line from any social media post to threat or harassment when we have wall to wall media coverage of this case,” Sauer told the court.

But those points were greeted coolly by the court.Trump echoed Nazis with use of word ‘vermin’, Biden says

Judge Brad Garcia pressed Sauer to explain why the court should not take preventive steps before violence materialises against potential witnesses or others. Another judge noted that a Texas woman who has since been arrested was accused of making a death threat against the judge in the Trump case, Tanya Chutkan, just one day after Trump posted on social: “If you go after me, I’m coming after you!”

“This is predictably going to intensify as well as the threats, so why isn’t the District Court justified in taking a more proactive measure and not waiting for more and more threats to occur and stepping in to protect the integrity of the trial?” Garcia asked.

Another judge in the case, Cornelia Pillard, sharply questioned Sauer over whether he believed any restrictions on Trump’s speech were allowed, telling him: “I don’t hear you giving any weight at all to the interest in a fair trial.”

Judge Millett recoiled at Sauer’s argument that Trump was merely engaged in core political speech.

“Labelling it core political speech begs the question if it’s political speech or speech aimed at derailing the criminal process,” she said.

But the judges also repeatedly wondered where to strike a balance, raising the prospect that the order could be narrow. Millett at one point expressed incredulity at the idea that Trump would not be able to respond to criticism by rival candidates in a debate.

“He has to speak Miss Manners while everyone else is throwing targets at him?”

The order has had a whirlwind trajectory through the courts since Chutkan imposed the order in response to a request from prosecutors, who cited among other comments Trump’s repeated disparagement of Smith as “deranged.”

The judge lifted it days after entering it, giving Trump’s lawyers time to prove why his words should not be restricted. But after Trump took advantage of that pause with comments that prosecutors said were meant to sway his former chief of staff against giving unfavourable testimony, Chutkan put it back in place.

The appeal court later lifted it as it considered Trump’s appeal.Donald Trump Jnr testifies about ‘sexiness’ of father’s property portfolio

Pillard and Millett are appointees of former president Barack Obama. Garcia joined the bench earlier this year after being nominated by US President Joe Biden. Obama and Biden are Democrats.

The four-count indictment against Trump in Washington is one of four criminal cases he faces as he seeks to reclaim the White House in 2024. The case is set for trial next March 4.

He has been charged in Florida, also by Smith’s team, with illegally hoarding classified documents at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Palm Beach, Florida. He has also been charged in state court in New York in connection with hush money payments to porn actor Stormy Daniels, who alleged an extramarital affair with him, and in Georgia with working to subvert the 2020 presidential election in that state.

Don't be surprised if Donald Trump's gag order in the federal election interference case is reimposed but narrowed in some way, if Monday's oral argument is any indication. While the three-judge federal appeals court panel in Washington sounded frustrated with the presentation by Trump's lawyer, it didn't seem fully satisfied with the government's approach, either.

Trump lawyer John Sauer didn't want to give an inch during his argument that restrictions on his client violated political speech rights under the First Amendment as Trump runs for office again. But Sauer's stubborn position left it unclear what a court could prohibit under a gag order that isn't already illegal.

Yet, the judges didn't sound completely assured by the argument from Justice Department lawyer Cecil VanDevender, including over what exactly Trump can say about special counsel Jack Smith, his staff and witnesses in the case.

As often happens in appellate proceedings, the panel was looking for where to draw the line, mindful of both the First Amendment and the considerations that led U.S. District Judge Tanya Chutkan to impose the order following Trump's history of menacing comments ahead of his scheduled March trial. He has pleaded not guilty to the indictment that accuses him of criminally plotting to overturn the 2020 election he lost to President Joe Biden. All three judges on the appellate panel were appointed by Democratic presidents -- one by Biden and two by Barack Obama.

If the panel is inclined to reimpose the order but in a more limited way, one open question is whether the judges specify the contours of their preferred order in their forthcoming opinion, or whether they send the matter back to Chutkan to formulate a new order based on the panel's ruling. Whatever the panel decides, further appeals to the Supreme Court may come.

In the meantime, the gag order in Washington is on hold, as is the order limiting Trump's statements about court staff in his ongoing civil fraud trial in New York.","{'uri': 'msnbc.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'MSNBC.com'}",[],"https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_nbcnews-fp-1024-512,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2023-11/231120-donald-trump-se-1241p-d6ecd2.jpg",eng-9078152,-0.3647058823529412,25,25,MSNBC.com,msnbc.com

The Foreign Secretary sought to reassure anxious Tory MPs of his stance on the controversial European Court of Human Rights.

Sources said he stressed the importance of punching on with Rishi Sunak's new plan for emergency legislation and a new treaty - and then take on Strasbourg if pushed.

The ex-PM even slapped down his close pal George Osborne for suggesting he was soft on the issue - saying his former Chancellor does not know his views on the subject too well.

Newly enobled Lord Cameron was grilled this evening at a packed meeting of the Conservative 1922 committee.

Sources at the gathering told The Sun his opening remarks stressed the importance of stopping the boats - a totemic issue for many Tories.

They said the ex-PM insisted he had first-hand experience with the European Court of Human Rights and knew what a pain it could be.

Lord Cameron cited his own battle in stripping prisoners of voting rights, an ECHR no-no which he continued to defy as PM.

Last week Mr Osborne said bringing the former PM back into government signalled that leaving the ECHR - demanded by some Tories - was off the table given his stance.

Many other Tory MPs including sacked Home Secretary Suella Braverman want Mr Sunak to go further by disapplying all ECHR or Human Rights Act laws in migration policy.

Immigration Minister Robert Jenrick is also said to be pushing this idea privately but has received pushback from Cabinet colleagues.

Supreme Court judges tore the Rwanda plan apart last week because it violated several international treaties as well as domestic law.

The PM scrambled to salvage the policy - which has already cost £140million - by announcing new laws to declare the East African nation ""safe"" so domestic courts will throw out appeals.

Today Government lawyer Lord Pannick was spotted clutching a draft of the new Removal to Rwanda Bill.

The grainy picture appeared to show reference to the Human Rights Act, sparking speculation Mr Sunak could be poised to disapply parts of it.

Mr Sunak also vowed to ignore ECHR so-called ""pyjama injunctions"" where anonymous Strasbourg judges scupper removal flights at the last minute.

Lord Cameron likened his address to Tory MPs tonight as ""a bit like going back to school"" and got a rapturous reception from backbenchers.

The judges picked apart Judge Tanya Chutkan's order, which prohibits Trump from targeting court personnel and witnesses, following his repeated attacks on Special Counsel Jack Smith. But they also acknowledged the difficulty of managing the case, asking whether the former president could use social media to in effect tell a witness 'don't act treasonously - don't cooperate' as a form of intimidation.

Trump's lawyer raised repeated concerns that the order would infringe on the former president's First Amendment rights, and members of the three-judge panel who are considering it weighed in with some of their misgivings while asking questions about who the former president could go after and under what circumstances. 'Is slimy liar inflammatory'? asked Judge Patricia Millet.

She asked a series of hypothetical questions to Cecil VanDevender, who argued on behalf of government prosecutors. 'I understand that he hasn't participated in debates thus far,' said Millet, who then proposed a hypothetical where Trump did appear on stage, and political rivals went after him for his repeated prosecutions (Trump is facing 91 charges in four criminal indictments). She asked why Trump couldn't respond by telling them it was all a 'political vendetta' by prosecutors who were 'doing the bidding of Joe Biden,' making a point of observing that 'I'm not saying everything's true here' in the hypothetical.

'He can't stand on the stage and say that?' the judge wanted to know. 'He has to speak Miss Manners while everyone else is throwing targets at him.' She also asked about what things Trump could and couldn't say, and whether it constituted disallowed 'targeting' versus allowable venting and protestations of his innocence. 'Is slimy liar inflammatory?' she wanted to know.

The judges revealed a keen interest in balancing the defendant's free speech rights with the government's interest in preserving a fair trial where witnesses come forward to speak truthfully and court personnel aren't subject to threats or harassment. The Justice Department cited a series of inflammatory Trump's both in recent months and during a period around his 2020 election overturn effort. 'I don't hear you giving any weight at all to the interests in a fair trial. Am I right that you don't?' Judge Cornelia Pillard asked Trump lawyer D. John Sauer.

The government conceded that Special Counsel Jack Smith, who Trump regularly calls 'deranged,' is a special case, as both a prominent representative of the government and a court personnel participant. But that raised the question, posed by judges, of whether Trump would be free to attack lower profile 'line prosecutors' in the case. The matter is more than academic after Trump faced a different gag order in his New York fraud case after going after Judge Arthur Engoron's chief clerk.

Her debate scenario (still hypothetical since Trump has been sitting them out while his Republican rivals mostly lay off him and attack each other) verged toward absurdity when Judge Millet asked questions about whether Trump could simply inveigh generally versus calling an individual a liar. 'But he can't say they're a liar?' she asked. VanDevender said he would be free to avoid a direct attack, and instead say 'what he said was untrue, and here's why.'

Then she asked if Trump could say someone was an 'untruth speaker?' All three judges are either Barack Obama or Joe Biden appointees, although the matter could get appealed to the Supreme Court if it goes against Trump.

Closely watched disputes in Colorado, Minnesota and Michigan have been dismissed by judges there, but voters seeking Trump's removal from the primary and general election ballots under Section 3 of the 14th Amendment have vowed to continue their fights, raising the possibility with each stage of proceedings that the Supreme Court will be asked to intervene.

""We are in uncharted waters. It's very unpredictable,"" Eric Segall, a law professor at Georgia State University, told CBS News. ""Whatever happens in state court, the Supreme Court, and on the actual merits of this and the procedures we're using, we're not finding the law, we're not interpreting the law, we are creating the law.""

Known as the disqualification clause, Section 3 of the 14th Amendment states that no person shall hold office if they have ""previously taken an oath as a member of Congress, or as an officer of the United States"" and engaged in insurrection or rebellion against the Constitution.

The clause was enacted in 1868, in the wake of the Civil War, to keep former Confederate civil and military officeholders from holding state or federal office again, and was largely forgotten until the Jan. 6, 2021, assault on the U.S. Capitol.

In the wake of the Jan. 6 attack, when a mob of Trump's supporters breached the U.S. Capitol in an attempt to stop Congress from tallying state electoral votes, groups of voters in Georgia and North Carolina argued that GOP Reps. Marjorie Taylor Greene and Madison Cawthorn were ineligible to run for reelection under Section 3.

An administrative law judge in Georgia found there was not enough evidence that Greene engaged in insurrection and should be kept off the ballot there, while Cawthorn's defeat in his primary ended the challenge to his eligibility.

But in New Mexico, a state court judge ruled that a county commissioner had to be removed from his post and is barred from holding any federal or state office under Section 3 because of his participation in the Jan. 6 riot.

Though the cases did not involve Trump, and Section 3 has never been invoked against a former president, they set important legal precedent, said Ron Fein, legal director of Free Speech For People, which brought the case against Cawthron.

""All three of these are important legal building blocks and precedents that we continue to cite in our case and [Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington] cites in Colorado and that help establish the legal framework that we're arguing in this case against Trump,"" Fein told CBS News.

Free Speech For People filed the legal challenges to Trump's candidacy in Michigan and Minnesota on behalf of voters in those states and is asking courts to block their secretaries of state from putting Trump on the 2024 GOP primary and general election ballots.

""We cannot allow our democracy to be extorted by threats of violence by unsuccessful political candidates like Trump,"" Fein said. ""And the lesson that the framers of the 14th Amendment learned at the price of hundreds of thousands of lives was that someone who took an oath to support the Constitution and broke that oath and engaged in insurrection is too dangerous for public office because if they are allowed back into office, they will do the same or worse.""

Cases brought by voters and advocacy groups that seek to disqualify Trump from running in 2024 have been brought in more than half of the states, including the cases that have gone to court in Colorado, Michigan and Minnesota, according to a compilation from Lawfare.

In Colorado, a state court judge in Denver said in a ruling Friday that Section 3 does not apply to Trump and ordered him to be placed on the presidential primary ballot. Judge Sarah Wallace wrote in her 102-page decision that Trump ""incited an insurrection on January 6, 2021 and therefore 'engaged' in insurrection within the meaning of Section Three of the Fourteenth Amendment"" -- the first time a court has ever made such a finding -- but she said was ""unpersuaded"" that Section 3 applies to the president under the phrase ""officers of the United States.""

In Minnesota, the state supreme court tossed out a case seeking to keep Trump off the ballot for the Republican primary because it is an ""internal party election to serve internal party purposes,"" but said Minnesota voters could pursue their case after the state's March 5 primary as to the general election ballot.

And in Michigan, a judge on the state Court of Claims ruled last week that the arguments from voters there present a political question that bars consideration by the courts ""at this time,"" and dismissed the suit.

Voters in Michigan appealed the decision Friday and are seeking immediate review by the Michigan Supreme Court. Meanwhile, Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, which is behind the Colorado suit, said it will file an appeal with the Colorado Supreme Court ""shortly.""

The cases raise questions that have been a subject of debate by legal scholars in panel discussions, op-eds and law review articles -- namely whether Jan. 6 was an ""insurrection,"" whether Trump engaged in insurrection and whether the presidency is among the offices covered by Section 3.

Wallace, the Colorado judge, wrote in her ruling that it appears the ""drafters of the Section Three of the Fourteenth Amendment did not intend to include the president as 'an officer of the United States,'"" and concluded that it does not apply to Trump.

As the proceedings make their way through the courts, legal scholars generally agree that if even one state high court rules that Trump is disqualified from running for office and orders him removed from the ballot, the former president will appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court, thrusting the nation's highest court into the center of a politically charged issue amid the 2024 campaign.

""If some jurisdictions start disqualifying him, the Supreme Court needs to weigh in,"" said Richard Hasen, an expert in election law and law professor at the University of California, Los Angeles. ""My dog in this fight is for finality.""

There are several issues that could give the Supreme Court an off-ramp to not deciding the merits of a case involving whether Trump is ineligible for office, but Hasen stressed that a definitive ruling from the justices would be in the nation's interest.

""We're going to be in a bad situation politically if this hangs over the election and people don't know if they're voting for a candidate who is not allowed to even hold office,"" he said.

Because elections in the U.S. are run by the states, legal experts predicted that there could be a situation where Trump's name is excluded from the ballot in one state -- if its high court rules he cannot hold office under Section 3 and that decision remains in force -- but listed on the ballot in another.

""On the one hand, that would be very unusual to have a major party candidate who's not on the ballot,"" said Press Millen, a trial attorney who represented the voters challenging Cawthorn's candidacy. ""But on the other hand, if you look at down-ballot races, it's not at all atypical.""

In the 2012 Republican presidential primary in Virginia, for example, candidates Newt Gingrich, Rick Santorum, Rick Perry and Jon Huntsman did not appear on the ballot, and there have been instances where the names of third-party candidates have been left off ballots in some states for general elections, such as Kanye West in Virginia, Arizona and Wisconsin in 2020.

""A state has a legitimate interest in excluding an ineligible candidate from the general election ballot, if it has to be resolved at that stage,"" Fein said.

He noted, though, that it's preferable for the issue of Trump's eligibility to be resolved at the primary stage so GOP primary voters can choose from candidates who are constitutionally eligible to hold office.

If Trump is kept off the ballot in a state, the former president could launch a write-in campaign, though the rules for doing so differ by state.

""But the big picture is that even if he amassed a majority of votes through a write-in campaign, he would continue to be ineligible to appear on the general election ballot, and it's not a way to evade the requirements of the Constitution,"" Fein said.","{'uri': 'cbsnews.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'CBS News'}",[],https://assets2.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2023/11/20/f5962ec0-7f19-441b-8821-5bf32ff2df62/thumbnail/1200x630g2/d59b323f6c9f7ff0de92d68cc48a0f5d/gettyimages-1790161182.jpg?v=5659e73acd91751548aa89950cf015b0,eng-9075414,0.1137254901960785,25,25,CBS News,cbsnews.com

(KDKA) -- The owner of a Westmoreland County gun store is facing charges after an investigation into her business sales, the district attorney's office said.

Tracey McMahan is facing multiple charges after the Westmoreland County District Attorney's Office said one customer paid her thousands of dollars for a gun that was never received and another tried to sell a shotgun but never got the money for it.

The district attorney's office said the investigation into McMahan, who owns Hi Grade Shooting Supply, began after a victim contacted Westmoreland County detectives in October.

According to investigators, the victim paid McMahan $4,600 to buy a combo shotgun through her business but the customer never got the gun or a refund. McMahan allegedly provided excuses, saying the firearm was lost in shipping or damaged before she stopped communicating, the district attorney's office said.

A second victim who tried to sell a firearm through Hi Grade Shooters Supply reported a similar situation to detectives.

The district attorney's office said the second victim tried to sell a Beretta shotgun to McMahan's business on consignment for $3,500 but never received the funds.

McMahan was charged with several counts of theft and receiving stolen property. The Westmoreland County District Attorney's Office said she's facing additional charges filed by Pennsylvania State Police. Court documents show she was also charged with theft by deception.

She was arraigned and released on $50,000 unsecured bond, the district attorney's office said.","{'uri': 'cbsnews.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'CBS News'}",[],https://assets3.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2021/12/10/ad507255-f1ed-4f28-9fc9-b7dcb8fdc9b2/thumbnail/1200x630/9c5032a913dafe0a2b96ed561a259033/GettyImages-1327894263.jpg?v=5659e73acd91751548aa89950cf015b0,,-0.3490196078431372,25,25,CBS News,cbsnews.com

(AP) - Michigan Democrats who have transformed gun laws in the state in the wake of multiple mass school shootings are now making it more difficult for individuals with convictions for misdemeanor domestic violence from gaining access to guns.

Gov. Gretchen Whitmer signed legislation Monday that prohibits individuals convicted of a misdemeanor related to domestic violence from possessing firearms for at least an eight-year-period. State law currently includes firearm restrictions for those with felonies related to domestic abuse, but no law had existed for misdemeanor domestic violence.

""These bills are based on a simple idea: if you have been found guilty in court for violently assaulting your partner, you should not be able to access a deadly weapon that you could use to further threatened, harm or kill them."" Whitmer said at a bill signing in Kalamazoo. ""It's just common sense.""

The eight-year ban for misdemeanor domestic violence convictions is only the latest firearm restriction added to Michigan law since Democrats took control of both chambers of the state Legislature and retained the governor's office last election.

Legislation implementing red flag laws, stricter background checks and safe storage requirements were all signed by Whitmer earlier this year. The overhauled gun laws follow two deadly mass school shootings that happened in Michigan within a 14-month period.

Democratic State Sen. Stephanie Chang, a lead sponsor of the bill package, said Monday that the latest legislation would put Michigan in line with similar laws in 31 other states and the District of Columbia.

Federal law already prohibits those charged with felonies or misdemeanors related to domestic violence from purchasing or possessing a gun. But advocates have pushed for state-level laws that they say can be better enforced and won't be threatened by future Supreme Court rulings.

Earlier this month, the Supreme Court took up a challenge to a federal law that prohibits people from having guns if they are under a court order to stay away from their spouse, partner or other family members. The nation's high court heard arguments on Nov. 7 and seemed likely to preserve the federal law.

""As the Supreme Court weighs whether to uphold common-sense laws to disarm domestic abusers, Governor Whitmer and the Michigan legislature are taking a clear stand: If you have a history of intimate partner violence, you have no business owning a gun,"" John Feinblatt, president of Everytown for Gun Safety, said in a statement.

Firearms are the most common weapon used in homicides of spouses, intimate partners, children or relatives in recent years, according to data from the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Guns were used in more than half, 57%, of those killings in 2020, a year that saw an overall increase in domestic violence during the coronavirus pandemic.

Under the legislation signed Monday in Michigan, people convicted of a misdemeanor that involved domestic violence will be not allowed to purchase, possess, or use a firearm or ammunition until they have completed the terms of imprisonment, paid all fines and eight years had passed.

The parents of Maggie Wardle, a 19-year-old shot and killed by an ex-boyfriend at Kalamazoo College in 1999, spoke in support of the legislation at Monday's signing.

""This law, now passed and signed into law today, will save someone´s life and give them the chance to live a full meaningful life, the chance Maggie did not get,"" Rick Omillian, Maggie´s stepfather, said Monday.","{'uri': 'dailymail.co.uk', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'Daily Mail Online'}",[],https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2023/11/20/19/wire-78033093-1700508369-448_636x382.jpg,eng-9078389,-0.403921568627451,25,25,Daily Mail Online,dailymail.co.uk

A gag order against former President Donald Trump in a federal election interference case is being weighed by a three-judge panel after they heard arguments in a federal appeals court in Washington, D.C., on Monday.

During the two-and-a-half hours of arguments, the appeals court judges appeared skeptical of both sides on whether to reinstate an order from a trial judge that prevented Trump from making inflammatory comments against prosecutors, potential witnesses and court staff.

Cecil VanDevender, a lawyer with Special Counsel Jack Smith's office, argued that a gag order is necessary to prevent intimidation and threats against participants in the case where Trump is accused of scheming to overturn the 2020 election.

Meanwhile, Trump lawyer John Sauer urged the court to revoke the order.

The court did not immediately rule, but the outcome of Monday's arguments will set parameters on what Trump, as both a criminal defendant and the leading candidate for the 2024 Republican presidential nomination, can and cannot say as the trial date nears.

The judges hearing the case include Cornelia Pillard and Patricia Millett, both appointees of former President Barack Obama, and Brad Garcia, who joined the bench earlier this year after being nominated by President Biden.

U.S. District Judge Tanya Chutkan first imposed the partial gag order Oct. 17, blocking Trump from making statements targeting Smith, his staff, witnesses and court personnel.

The order was later put on hold pending a previous appeal from the former president before being reinstated by Chutkan on Oct. 29.

The order does not prevent Trump from airing general complaints about the case, and Chutkan has said the former president is still allowed to assert his claims of innocence and that the case is politically motivated.

Trump has continued to deny any wrongdoing in the case, and has argued that it is part of an effort to prevent him from winning the presidency in 2024. He has also sharply criticized those involved in the case, including Smith, whom he often refers to as ""deranged.""

A panel of judges in a federal appeals court said Monday that only the federal government -- not citizens and groups -- can sue under a key part of the Voting Rights Act, effectively gutting the legislation in seven states.

The ruling, which applies to Arkansas, Iowa, Minnesota, Missouri, Nebraska, North Dakota and South Dakota, found that only the U.S. attorney general is able to bring a suit under Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act.

The vast majority of Voting Rights Act claims are brought by private citizens and civil rights groups, who foot the bill for time-consuming litigation to protect voting rights. The Department of Justice, with limited staff and resources, typically brings just a small fraction of the cases fought nationally.

It is sure to be challenged -- likely to the U.S. Supreme Court -- which has limited the voting law's power significantly over the last decade.

""If this ruling were allowed to stand, it would decimate the Voting Rights Act,"" Rick Hasen, an election law expert at the UCLA School of Law, said.

The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit ruled Monday that the Arkansas State Conference NAACP and the Arkansas Public Policy Panel could not challenge redistricting maps in Arkansas because Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act does not provide a ""private right of action.""

The groups had sought to challenge Arkansas lawmakers' redistricting in the state, where a Republican-controlled legislature drew eleven majority-Black districts in the state's 100-seat House of Representatives. The state is 16% Black.

The ruling, affirming a lower court's dismissal of the case, goes against decades of precedent where judges have assumed or specifically affirmed a private right of action under the Voting Rights Act.

""Since the original Arkansas opinion came down, I think there have been 15 decisions by other courts around the country about whether Section 2 includes a private right of action and all but one of held like, of course it does,"" said Michael Li, a redistricting expert at the Brennan Center for Justice.

Li said he believes the ruling will be overturned on appeal, but it is currently the law of the land in seven states.

In addition to blocking the Arkansas groups from seeking additional voting rights for Black voters there, the ruling will overturn a recent win for Native American voters in North Dakota. A federal judge ruled last week that North Dakota state lawmakers had diluted two Native American tribes' voting rights, violating Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act. Lawmakers were due to redraw state legislative maps before the end of the year.","{'uri': 'nbcnews.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'NBC News'}",[],"https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_nbcnews-fp-1024-512,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2023-11/231120-voters-election-se-1255p-51db7c.jpg",eng-9078082,0.1607843137254903,25,25,NBC News,nbcnews.com

""He has to speak 'Miss Manners' while everyone else is throwing targets at him?"" Millett said skeptically during a two-hour oral argument at the federal courthouse in Washington. ""It would be really hard in a debate, when everyone else is going at you full bore. Your attorneys would have to have scripted little things you can say.""

""It's not how I want my children to speak,"" Millett added of Trump's rhetoric, ""but that's really not the question.""

Another appeals judge, Nina Pillard, suggested on at least five occasions that the trial judge's order goes too far by appearing to bar Trump from making hostile comments about individuals in the public eye who could be witnesses in the case.

Pillard said she doubted figures like former Vice President Mike Pence, former Attorney General Bill Barr or former Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman Mark Milley were likely to change their stories based on Trump's invective -- or even based on more direct threats or attacks that might flow from them.

""I would assume that their testimony would not be affected,"" said Pillard, also an Obama appointee.

Despite the panel's concerns with the breadth of the gag order, imposed last month by U.S. District Court Tanya Chutkan, the appeals judges nevertheless seemed prepared to endorse a narrower version of it, agreeing with prosecutors that Trump shouldn't have carte blanche to make statements that could intimidate witnesses or threaten the integrity of the proceedings.

""We have to use a careful scalpel here,"" Millett said.

It's unclear whether the appeals court panel intends to rewrite the gag order itself or send it back to Chutkan with new instructions. The timeline for action is also unclear. The panel took up the case on an emergency basis, but it often takes weeks or months for an appeals court panel to rule on complex issues of law. And the panel is likely not the final word: The losing side may appeal the panel's decision to the full bench of the appeals court or the Supreme Court.

Both Millett and Pillard suggested that Trump's attorneys gave too little weight to Chutkan's responsibility to protect the trial. And the appeals panel's third judge, Bradley Garcia, an appointee of President Joe Biden, noted that Chutkan had issued the gag order after holding a detailed hearing on the matter and gathering voluminous facts to support her decision.

Chutkan issued the order on Oct. 16, but it's not currently in effect because the appeals court panel suspended it while the panel considers the matter.

Chutkan imposed the gag order to constrain Trump's inflammatory rhetoric, saying his attacks on prosecutors and potential witnesses posed a threat to the ""administration of justice"" and risked stoking threats against people involved in the case. Trump is set to go on trial March 4 on charges that he committed multiple conspiracies to derail the transfer of power in a bid to remain president despite losing the 2020 election.

On Monday, at a federal courthouse steps from the Capitol, special counsel Jack Smith -- under guard by deputy U.S. marshals -- watched as one of his prosecutors, Cecil VanDevender, argued for the reinstatement of the gag order.

In her order, Chutkan barred Trump from ""targeting"" potential witnesses or referencing the subject of their testimony. She also forbade Trump from going after prosecutors by name, while permitting him to make broader attacks on the Biden administration and the Justice Department. And the Obama-appointed judge also barred Trump from attacking court personnel.

After the panel suspended the gag order while it hears Trump's appeal, Trump used the interim to resume his attacks on Smith's team -- and even on Smith's family members -- as well as potential witnesses.

Pillard seemed to concur with Trump lawyers' arguments that language in the gag order prohibiting their client from ""targeting"" prosecutors, jurors and witnesses was vague.

""'Targeting' does raise a little bit of unclarity,"" she said.

The appeals court judges sharply criticized Trump's position that virtually any restriction on his ability to discuss the case publicly would be a violation of his First Amendment free speech rights. But they seemed at times to be equally confounded by prosecutors' efforts to draw lines about which aspects of Trump's speech were acceptable and which weren't.

At one point, to the judges' consternation, VanDevender said Trump's description of a prospective witness as a ""liar"" would be impermissible, but he could describe the same witness as someone who tells ""untruths.""

""I know that's a little bit of a fine line,"" VanDevender said.

The judges also seemed perplexed by the order's prohibition on statements that target Smith himself -- or even the line prosecutors who work for him. Many of those attorneys may be public figures in their own right and represent the government the same way Smith does, they noted.

In an apparent concession, VanDevender told the judges that Smith was not asking to be personally protected from criticism by Trump.

The judges didn't dwell on the question of whether it's proper to consider Trump's political role when making decisions related to his criminal case, but Millett pressed Trump's attorney, John Sauer, about whether he would be making these arguments if Trump were not a candidate for president.

""It's still unconstitutional,"" Sauer said of the gag order. ""The campaign adds an additional, but still-powerful, reason.""

On several occasions during Monday's arguments in the large ceremonial courtroom, Millett raised her voice in frustration at lawyers for both sides. She also briefly buried her head in her hands late in the court session.

Prosecutors cast the gag order as an urgent constraint on Trump's ability to intimidate or threaten witnesses. They say he knowingly stokes violent supporters to act against his perceived adversaries and has overtly attempted to silence key witnesses like his former White House chief of staff, Mark Meadows -- messages that could also chill the testimony of less powerful figures.

They cited his August social media post -- ""If you go after me, I'm coming after you"" -- as well as his targeted attacks on Meadows, Pence and Milley, all potential witnesses in the case. In September, Trump accused Milley of treatson and said he would have been put to death in an earlier era.

Trump also repeatedly casts Smith as ""deranged"" and has attacked specific prosecutors in his office.

Chutkan's directive is separate from a gag order a New York state judge issued against Trump last month, barring him from commenting publicly about the judge's principal law clerk or other court staff. That judge, Arthur Engoron, has been overseeing a lengthy bench trial in a civil case the New York attorney general filed targeting Trump's business empire over claims of pervasive fraud.

Last week, a state appeals court judge temporarily lifted the gag order there. Trump responded by quickly taking to his social media site to fire off a new salvo against Engoron and his clerk.","{'uri': 'politico.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'POLITICO'}",[],https://static.politico.com/3f/6b/e7dcc78f44e2ad9beb94f07f5646/https-delivery-gettyimages.com/downloads/1527386991,eng-9078152,-0.2941176470588235,25,25,POLITICO,politico.com

The New York Court of Appeals, in a unanimous decision, ruled that the law is clear in its language and that it does not conflict with an existing state law that bans police from using chokes.

The city's law came as governments across the country prohibited or severely limited the use of chokeholds or similar restraints by police following Floyd's death in 2020, which occurred as a Minneapolis police officer kneeled on his neck for several minutes.

The Police Benevolent Association of the City of New York, along with other law enforcement unions, sued the city over its law and have argued that its language is vague as to what officers are allowed to do during an arrest. In a statement, John Nuthall, a spokesman for the Police Benevolent Association of the City of New York, said the ruling will provide clarity to officers.

""While this is not the outcome we had hoped for, the Court´s decision is a victory insofar that it will provide our officers with greater certainty when it comes to the statute, because under this Court´s decision, it must be proven at a minimum that an officer´s action in fact 'impedes the person´s ability to breathe,´ was 'not accidental,´ and was not a 'justifiable use of physical force,´"" Nuthall said.

The New York Police Department has long barred its officers from using chokeholds to subdue people. New York state also has a law banning police chokeholds that was named after Eric Garner, who was killed when a New York Police Department officer placed him in a chokehold in 2014.

The city's law, while banning chokes, also includes a provision that forbids officers from compressing a person's diaphragm. Such a compression, though kneeling, sitting or standing on a person's chest or back, can make it difficult to breath.

Palestine Action activists will argue they had ""lawful justification"" to commit burglary and criminal damage against an Israeli defence company they wanted to shut down, a court has heard.

The eight defendants, including the group's co-founders, are charged with offences relating to a campaign to put Elbit Systems' UK arm ""out of business"".

Opening the prosecution case at Snaresbrook crown court in north-east London on Monday, Sally Hogan said the defendants, who are not all charged with each of the 13 counts, do not deny committing burglaries, causing damage to the outside of buildings, threatening Elbit's landlord, Jones Lang LaSalle, in order to put the company out of business nor possession of articles with intent to cause criminal damage, but claim they were entitled to do so in law.

She told the jury: ""They caused damage to property, damage that caused thousands of pounds. They went into buildings as trespassers with the intent of causing damage ... Why did they want to do that? They wanted to put Elbit out of business.

""They say what we did was with a lawful justification and that is the stark issue for you, members of the jury [to decide upon].""

Hogan said Palestine Action was a ""lawful protest group"", set up by Huda Ammori and Richard Barnard, who recruited the other defendants and other individuals to their organisation. She told the jury the prosecution case was that the pair ""in a sense directed to others about what they should do"". Hogan said Ammori and Barnard had posted online about what they were doing and ""why they said they were justified in taking the action they took"".

The prosecutor said that while there was a right to disagree and protest in the UK, the demonstrations by Palestine Action had crossed the line of what was allowed into unlawful protest and had not followed the rule of law.

She said: ""It won't have escaped your knowledge that there have been many protests recently but the prosecution say there are rules, there are laws to prevent offences being committed during the course of protests.""

The defendants - Ammori, Barnard, Caroline Brouard, Jocelyn Cooney, Robin Refualu, Genevieve Scherer, Nicola Deane and Emily Arnott - are all charged with encouraging people to commit criminal damage against Elbit, which they all deny in fact and in law. They have pleaded not guilty to all of the offences, which are said to have occurred between June 2020 and February 2021.","{'uri': 'theguardian.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","[{'uri': 'haroon_siddique@theguardian.com', 'name': 'Haroon Siddique', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': False}]",https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/79ce0651420c409cf15f3da152e8effa79612c84/0_383_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&s=d474a3d5e0ee4e82abcead81ec572ab3,,-0.4352941176470588,25,25,The Guardian,theguardian.com

The ABA's Council of the Section of Legal Education and Admission to the Bar voted Friday to gather public comments on proposed changes to its standards that would enable new and existing law schools with no physical campus to apply for accreditation.

Only law schools with brick-and-mortar locations are currently eligible for ABA accreditation. The ABA has allowed a growing number of those schools to offer fully or mostly online Juris Doctor programs alongside their residential ones, but fully online schools have remained ineligible to apply for the ABA's stamp of approval.

Daniel Thies, chairperson of the ABA Council's Strategic Review Committee, on Friday called the proposal to accredit online law schools a ""significant change"" that could help lower the cost of a legal education. He noted that online J.D. programs offered by ABA-accredited law schools generally charge the same tuition for online and residential students.

""Likely, that's because they're all offered by brick-and-mortar law schools that have all the same expenses associated with brick-and-mortar law schools,"" Thies said.

ABA accreditation would be a boon for the small cohort of existing online law schools because their graduates would be able to sit for the bar exam in any state. Currently only California offers the bar for graduates of non-ABA accredited law schools.

Thies suggested that some traditional law schools may object to the change for fear of added competition. But longstanding perceptions that distance education is lower quality than in-person teaching have diminished significantly following the rapid shift to online education during the COVID-19 pandemic, several ABA council members said Friday.

Purdue Global Law School is the oldest online law school -- it was founded in 1998 as the Concord Law School before its acquisition by Purdue in 2017. There are a handful of other fully online law schools scattered across the country.

Annual tuition for Purdue's part-time online J.D. program is about $13,500. By comparison, annual tuition for ABA-accredited Southwestern Law School's new fully online J.D. program is the same as its residential program -- $38,944 for part-time students.

""I am very happy to see that the ABA is finally considering moving in this direction,"" said Purdue Law Dean Martin Pritikin said Monday. ""Virtually every other field of higher education has been quicker to embrace online learning.""

Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com.

When Staff Sgt. Buck Aldridge fatally shot Leonard Cure during a roadside struggle after pulling him over for speeding, it wasn't the first time a traffic stop involving the Camden County sheriff's deputy had spiraled into violence.

Last year, Aldridge dragged a driver from a car that crashed after fleeing the deputy on Interstate 95. Body and dash camera video obtained by The Associated Press show the driver on his back as Aldridge punches him. Records indicate the deputy faced no disciplinary action.

Personnel records show Aldridge was fired in August 2017 by a police department in the same Georgia county after he threw a woman to the ground and handcuffed her during a traffic stop. The Camden County Sheriff's Office hired him nine months later.

Aldridge stopped Cure for speeding Oct. 16 and ended up shocking the 53-year-old Black man with a Taser after he refused to put his hands behind him to be cuffed. Body and dash camera videos show Cure fought back and had a hand at the deputy's throat when Aldridge shot him point-blank.

Relatives have said Cure likely resisted because of psychological trauma from spending 16 years imprisoned in Florida for an armed robbery he didn't commit. Officials exonerated and freed him in 2020.

The Georgia Bureau of Investigation is investigating Cure's death and will submit its findings to prosecutors. Aldridge's attorney said the video shows he fired in self-defense. Critics question whether he should have been wearing a badge at all, given his history of aggression.

""This guy should have never been on the force,"" said Timothy Bessent Sr., president of Camden County's NAACP chapter.

The AP obtained Aldridge's personnel records as well as reports and videos from the June 2022 chase and arrest using Georgia's open records law.

A former U.S. Marine, Aldridge, 41, worked nearly five years for the Kingsland Police Department in Georgia's southeast corner. His file shows Aldridge was disciplined for using unnecessary force in February 2014 and May 2017. The second time he was suspended for three days without pay.

The department fired Aldridge for his third infraction just three months later. Police records say Aldridge was assisting with a traffic stop when he tried to handcuff a woman -- not to arrest her, but to keep her outside her car. One deputy told investigators Aldridge cuffed the woman after ""picking her up and throwing her on the ground."" She was cited for letting an unlicensed person drive her car.

Aldridge was hired by the sheriff's office in May 2018. He disclosed his firing on his job application.

Aldridge's termination wouldn't automatically disqualify him from working for another agency, though some would consider it a huge liability, said retired police Maj. Neill Franklin.

""If someone's terminated from another police department for use of excessive force, they're not getting hired by the Maryland State Police or the Baltimore Police Department,"" said Franklin, who led training programs for both agencies. ""It's just not worth the risk.""

Bessent and other advocates say it's an example of Camden County Sheriff Jim Proctor tolerating unnecessary violence.

Proctor, who has been sheriff for a decade, declined to comment. Spokesman Capt. Larry Bruce cited the investigation into Cure's death and pending civil litigation involving other deputies.

Since last year, six Camden County deputies have been indicted on felony charges and fired for violence against jail detainees and a motorist.

In September 2022, jail security cameras recorded guards rushing into the cell of Jarrett Hobbs, who was punched in the head and neck and hurled against a wall. Hobbs was charged with assaulting jailers until his attorney obtained the video. His charges were dropped, and three deputies were indicted.

Two more jailers were charged and fired for incidents in March and July. Security video showed one push a detainee to the floor and punch him before another guard intervened. The other deputy shoved a handcuffed detainee headfirst into a door, knocking him unconscious.

GEORGIA SUSPECT, 17, KILLED AFTER FATALLY SHOOTING POLICE K-9, AUTHORITIES SAY

""You've got these deputies running wild and doing what they want to do,"" said Harry Daniels, a civil rights attorney who won a legal settlement for Hobbs. ""The consequences have come from the GBI and the district attorney's office. It should not come from an outside agency.""

He points to Christine Newman, named ""Deputy of the Month"" two months after a dash camera recorded her slapping a handcuffed driver across the face and slamming the woman's head into a patrol SUV. The driver had refused to exit her vehicle after being pulled over for a rolling stop Jan. 16, 2022.

Newman was fired a year later after being indicted on charges including aggravated assault and violating her oath of office. She has pleaded not guilty. Newman's attorney, Robert Persse, called her a ""loyal deputy"" whom he looks forward to defending in court.

The number of deputies facing charges ""indicates a culture that may not encourage use of force, but certainly tolerates inappropriate use of force,"" said retired LaGrange, Georgia, Police Chief Louis Dekmar.

""If folks are held accountable and there are clear lines, you generally don't see that in law enforcement agencies,"" said Dekmar, a former president of the International Association of Chiefs of Police.

A spike in claims involving the sheriff's office caused Camden County's government to get dropped by its insurance company in July, said Mike Spiers, the county's risk management director. The county got new policies, he said, but its deductible for liability jumped from $25,000 per claim to $250,000.

Aldridge was placed on administrative leave while the GBI investigates Cure's death.

""Buck Aldridge is a fine officer and the video speaks for itself,"" said Adrienne Browning, Aldridge's attorney. ""It's clear his life was in danger and he defended himself.""

Video of the fatal confrontation along I-95 shows Aldridge telling Cure he's being charged with reckless driving for speeding in excess of 100 mph (161 kph). Cure argues, but obeys commands to get out and put his hands on his truck. However, he ignores commands to put his hands behind him.

That's when Aldridge fires his Taser into Cure's back. Cure fights back, and video shows them grappling beside the highway. Cure maintains a grip on Aldridge's face and neck after being struck with a baton.

""Yeah, bitch!"" Cure says. Then he slumps to the ground after Aldridge fires a single shot.

Dekmar, Franklin and a third expert told AP they believe the shooting was legal, as Aldridge appeared to be in danger when he fired. But they also criticized how Aldridge began the encounter by shouting at Cure and said he made no effort to deescalate.

""He escalated the situation with Mr. Cure,"" said former Memphis police officer Thaddeus Johnson, a criminal justice professor at Georgia State University and a senior fellow for the Council on Criminal Justice. ""He has no control over his emotions.""

Johnson said Aldridge showed a similar lack of control during a June 2022 arrest after chasing two speeding cars.

After one car crashes, body and dash camera video shows Aldridge shouting expletives as he approaches with his gun drawn. The driver is on his back when Aldridge starts dragging him headfirst from the car, then punches him.

The driver resists being cuffed but complies after another deputy's dog bites him and Aldridge shocks him with a Taser. The driver was charged with drug trafficking, reckless driving and fleeing an officer.

Aldridge was promoted to staff sergeant two months later. His sheriff's personnel file shows no disciplinary actions.

Johnson said he sees no justification for Aldridge punching the arrested driver. Even if prosecutors don't charge him in Cure's death, he said, ""from what I saw in the video, he deserves to be fired.""

""We have to hold officers to a higher standard,"" Johnson said, ""even though they are human.""","{'uri': 'foxnews.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'Fox News'}",[],https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2023/11/Camden-County-Sheriffs-Office.gif,eng-9076017,-0.2705882352941177,25,25,Fox News,foxnews.com

Michael Gove, the Levelling Up, Housing and Communities Secretary, had in July refused planning permission for the scheme on heritage and environmental grounds, overturning approval from the local council.

Stuart Machin, the CEO of M&amp;S, one of the best-known names in British business, called Gove's decision ""utterly pathetic"" and in August the retailer launched a legal challenge.

""We are pleased that the court has recognised the merits of our legal challenge on every one of the six counts that we raised, and approved our case to proceed to the next stage,"" Machin said in a statement.

""We have been clear from the very start that the refurbishment of the existing store was not possible, so this is only the first step in the lengthy process of overturning the government´s senseless decision.""

The Department for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities declined to comment.

Earlier this month, M&amp;S beat first-half profit forecasts and said it expected full-year profit to rise by more than 30% as its latest turnaround effort gathered momentum.

Klain most recently was a partner at U.S. law firm O'Melveny & Myers since April. He rejoined the firm, where he worked earlier in his career, after holding the top advisor role in the White House until February.

He will join San Francisco-based Airbnb as chief legal officer on Jan. 1 and report to co-founder and CEO Brian Chesky, the company said.

""Ron is both a big-picture strategic thinker and a highly skilled operator, and I'm thrilled he'll be a close advisor,"" Chesky said in a statement.

In his most recent stint at O'Melveny, Klain was a member of the firm's executive committee and headed its strategic counseling and crisis management practice. The Los Angeles-founded firm has about 800 lawyers globally.

A longtime Democratic staffer, he was earlier chief of staff to former Vice President Al Gore and to Biden when he was vice president under President Barack Obama.

Klain said he had planned to be at O'Melveny indefinitely, but the opportunity to join Airbnb ""was impossible to pass up.""

O'Melveny chair Bradley Butwin said in a statement that the firm appreciates Klain's contributions and will continue to work closely with him as a client.

Klain will succeed Rich Baer, who joined Airbnb as legal chief in 2019 and announced his retirement last month, according to a company spokesperson.

Jay Carney, a former Amazon executive who previously served as White House press secretary to President Barack Obama and communications director to Biden when he was vice president, joined Airbnb as global head of policy and communications last year.

A New York judge in August dismissed a June lawsuit Airbnb had filed against New York City over legislation the company called a ""de facto ban"" against short-term rentals. The law took effect in September.

Cities around the United States and globally are more closely regulating short-term rentals, including by requiring hosts to obtain licenses and pay registration fee, or by limiting rentals in business districts.","{'uri': 'reuters.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'Reuters'}","[{'uri': 'sara_merken@reuters.com', 'name': 'Sara Merken', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': False}]",https://www.reuters.com/resizer/IRVumahc2oZwMpAQmx8kc9xLFO4=/728x381/smart/filters:quality(80)/cloudfront-us-east-2.images.arcpublishing.com/reuters/VQJYEL6P7NIO5EXINJ432O3TPY.jpg,eng-9076984,0.2156862745098038,25,25,Reuters,reuters.com

The judges picked apart Judge Tanya Chutkan's order, which prohibits Trump from targeting court personnel and witnesses, following his repeated attacks on Special Counsel Jack Smith. But they also acknowledged the difficulty of managing the case, asking whether the former president could use social media to in effect tell a witness 'don't act treasonously - don't cooperate' as a form of intimidation.

Trump's lawyer raised repeated concerns that the order would infringe on the former president's First Amendment rights, and members of the three-judge panel who are considering it weighed in with some of their own misgivings, while asking questions about who the former president could go after and under what circumstances.

'Is slimy liar inflammatory'? asked Judge Patricia Millet.

A federal appeals court is weighing a gag order that a district judge imposed on former President Donald Trump preventing him from targeting potential witnesses or court personnel in his January 6 case

She asked a series of hypothetical questions to Cecil VanDevender, who argued on behalf of government prosecutors.

'I understand that he hasn't participated in debates thus far,' said Millet, who then proposed a hypothetical where Trump did appear on stage, and political rivals went after him for his repeated prosecutions (Trump is facing 91 charges in four criminal indictments).

She asked why Trump couldn't respond by telling them it was all a 'political vendetta' by prosecutors who were 'doing the bidding of Joe Biden,' making a point of observing that 'I'm not saying everything's true here' in the hypothetical.

'He can't stand on the stage and say that?' the judge wanted to know.

'He has to speak Miss Manners while everyone else is throwing targets at him.'

She also asked about what things Trump could and couldn't say, and whether it constituted disallowed 'targeting' versus allowable venting and protestations of his innocence.

'Is slimy liar inflammatory?' she wanted to know.

Trump has repeatedly called Jack Smith 'deranged.' But could he call him a 'slimy liar' under the terms of a gag order?

Judge Tanya Chutkan imposed the order. The court must weigh free speech and fair trial issues

The judges revealed a keen interest in balancing the defendant's free speech rights with the government's interest in preserving a fair trial where witnesses come forward to speak truthfully and court personnel aren't subject to threats or harassment.

The Justice Department cited a series of inflammatory Trump's both in recent months and during a period around his 2020 election overturn effort.

'I don't hear you giving any weight at all to the interests in a fair trial. Am I right that you don't?' Judge Cornelia Pillard asked Trump lawyer D. John Sauer.

The government conceded that Special Counsel Jack Smith, who Trump regularly calls 'deranged,' is a special case, as both a prominent representative of the government and a court personnel participant.

But that raised the question, posed by judges, of whether Trump would be free to attack lower profile 'line prosecutors' in the case.

The matter is more than academic, after Trump faced a different gag order in his New York fraud case after going after Judge Arthur Engoron's chief clerk.

In her debate scenario (still hypothetical since Trump has been sitting them out while his Republican rivals mostly lay off him and attack each other) verged toward absurdity when Judge Millet asked questions about whether Trump could simply inveigh generally versus calling an individual a liar.

'But he can't say they're a liar?' she asked.

VanDevender said he would be free to avoid a direct attack, and instead say 'what he said was untrue and here's why.'

Then she asked if Trump could say someone was an 'untruth speaker?'

All three judges are either Barack Obama or Joe Biden appointees, although the matter could get appealed to the Supreme Court if it goes against Trump,.","{'uri': 'dailymail.co.uk', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'Daily Mail Online'}",[],https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2023/11/20/17/78029781-0-image-m-16_1700501540770.jpg,eng-9073936,-0.2313725490196078,25,25,Daily Mail Online,dailymail.co.uk

Democratic Gov. Janet Mills and Attorney General Aaron Frey have tasked the commission with performing a review of the events leading up to the Lewiston shootings and the response to it. Army reservist Robert Card, 40, killed 18 people in a bowling alley and a restaurant on Oct. 25 before dying of a self-inflicted gunshot wound.

The commission held its first meeting on Monday and members unanimously voted to request subpoena power from the Maine Legislature.

""We will be seeking military records, and those might not be accessible to us without subpoena power,"" said Toby Dilworth, a former assistant U.S. attorney for the District of Maine and a commission member. ""It's essential that we have this subpoena power.""

The commission is chaired by Daniel Wathen, former chief justice of the Maine Supreme Judicial Court. Other members include Debra Baeder, the former chief forensic psychologist for the state, and Paula Silsby, a former U.S. attorney for the District of Maine.

The panel is expected to investigate potential missed opportunities to prevent the shootings. Card was well known to law enforcement and fellow service members had raised flags about his behavior, mental health state and potential for violence before the shootings. Card spent two weeks in a psychiatric hospital in New York last summer after an altercation with other reserve members.

Mills and Frey swiftly released a statement that they supported the move to see subpoena power. Mills, who created the commission via executive order, has called on the commission to follow the facts of the case and keep them as transparent to the public as possible.

Mills and Frey said in their statement they would ""immediately begin consulting with the Independent Commission and legislative leadership to prepare legislation granting the commission the power of subpoena, with the goal of having that legislation prepared for the Legislature´s consideration at the beginning of the next session.""

The commission will meet again on Dec. 14, Wathen said. He said his goal was for the commission to produce a written report within six months, which was a timeline he called ""a very ambitious goal, but highly desirable for obvious reasons.""

The commission also took comments from the public on Monday. Rep. Suzanne Salisbury, a Westbrook Democrat, called on the commission to collaborate with law enforcement as it performs its review.

""I hope that law enforcement's voice can be heard and used as the experts they are,"" Salisbury said.

Late Friday afternoon, Colorado District Judge Sarah Wallace handed down her ruling in a case brought to challenge former President Donald Trump's eligibility to hold office again under Section 3 of the 14th Amendment. The case had several questions to answer, including whether this clause applied to Trump, whether he'd ""engaged"" in an insurrection and whether, as the plaintiffs in the case argued, the Colorado secretary of state should be required to keep him off the ballot.

The answers Wallace came to were stacked against Trump, including that ""Trump engaged in an insurrection on January 6, 2021 through incitement, and that the First Amendment does not protect Trump's speech."" Wallace nevertheless decided Trump was eligible for the ballot anyway, finding that the drafters of the 14th Amendment did not include the president as an ""officer"" of the United States. The resulting victory for Trump, ordering an insurrectionist to be placed on the ballot, threatens the future of democracy on the most confounding of technicalities.

The so-called insurrection clause of the 14th Amendment targets anyone who swore an oath ""as a member of Congress, or as an officer of the United States, or as a member of any State legislature, or as an executive or judicial officer of any State, to support the Constitution of the United States."" If, after swearing that oath, that person ""engaged in insurrection or rebellion against the same, or given aid or comfort to the enemies thereof,"" then they are barred from being ""Senator or Representative in Congress, or elector of President and Vice-President,"" or holding ""any office, civil or military"" at the state or federal levels. Both parts of that construction are important, as we'll get into later.

In her ruling, Wallace walked through each of the hurdles that could trip up the case and found that the petitioners -- a group of Republican and unaffiliated voters -- had cleared almost all of them. Unlike states like Michigan, state law in Colorado specifically gives the secretary of state the power to determine whether a candidate is qualified for the role in question. And past secretaries of state have kept people off the ballot for any number of reasons, clearly setting a precedent for doing the same with Trump.

Wallace agreed with testimony given during the two-week trial that the 14th Amendment's insurrection clause didn't only apply to those who took part in the Civil War and that a law later passed by Congress didn't negate its effect. She also ruled that the House Jan. 6th Committee's findings, which Trump-friendly witnesses attacked as a political hit job, were relevant and credible. Accordingly, she found that the Jan. 6, 2021 attack on the Capitol ""easily satisfy"" the definition of an insurrection as used in the 14th Amendment.

As for whether Trump ""engaged"" in an insurrection, Wallace rejected his defense that his statements leading up to storming the Capitol were protected speech under the First Amendment. While she rejected the petitioners' argument that Trump's inaction to stop the attack sooner was disqualifying in and of itself, she found it did help prove his intent. ""Engagement under Section Three of the Fourteenth Amendment includes incitement to insurrection,"" she concluded, and Trump's actions fit the bill.

In the last few pages of the 102-page decision, though, Wallace turned toward whether the clause applies specifically to Trump as a former president. And that's where everything falls apart.

Wallace ruled that it's both unclear from the amendment's phrasing whether the presidency is an ""office...under the United States"" that someone could be blocked from holding, or whether ""Trump took an oath as 'an officer of the United States'"" when he became president.

It's a stance that left me gobsmacked when I first read it because it may be the finest splitting of hairs that I've ever seen in so crucial a ruling. For example, Wallace buys the Trump team's arguments that ""Section Three specifies that the disqualifying oath is one to 'support' the Constitution whereas the Presidential oath is to 'preserve, protect and defend' the Constitution."" She also accepts the team's claim that an earlier draft of the amendment which included the president and vice president instead of ""officers"" meant that the two roles were deliberately excluded from the final version's intended effects.

Let's go ahead and say for a second that the drafters of the amendment didn't specifically have former presidents in mind when listing people who had sworn to protect the Constitution. It may have been entirely unthinkable that such a person could engage in insurrection -- but to refute that the president is, as expert testimony during the trial stated, an officer of the United States defies reason. Especially when that refutation is based on the idea that the term is too broad to include the presidency.

In finding the narrowest possible justification for ruling that Trump isn't disqualified, Wallace refused to stick her neck out ahead of the other courts that have either punted on the decision until later or claiming that it's Congress that needs to make the final call. In the second to last paragraph, she even concedes the ruling was influenced by her ""reluctance to embrace an interpretation which would disqualify a presidential candidate without a clear, unmistakable indication that such is the intent of Section Three.""

Yes, it's true that Trump is an anomaly in many ways. His attempt to stay in the White House after losing the 2020 election has raised a number of questions that our political and legal systems have never had to answer. But as the Justice Department said in a recent court filing, he stands ""stands alone in American history for his alleged crimes. No other president has engaged in conspiracy and obstruction to overturn valid election results and illegitimately retain power."" And while he has not been convicted in either the federal election interference case or the one brought in Georgia, his well-established efforts to overturn a lawful election and prevent the peaceful transfer of power cannot and should not be underemphasized in these rulings.

I didn't expect every case being filed against Trump's qualifications to be a slam dunk victory for the plaintiffs. There were always going to be enough competing rulings that the question would reach the Supreme Court. I am also glad that there is now at the very least a legal determination that Trump met the higher bar of ""engaging"" in insurrection in 2021. But I am surprised, and disappointed, by how hard judges and other officials have scrambled to find even the slightest plausible loophole to avoid holding Trump accountable.","{'uri': 'msnbc.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'MSNBC.com'}",[],"https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_nbcnews-fp-1024-512,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2023-11/231120-donald-trump-jm-1032-ea678f.jpg",eng-9075414,0.08235294117647052,25,25,MSNBC.com,msnbc.com

Four consumers in New York, Hawaii, South Carolina and Georgia filed the lawsuit on Friday in San Jose, California, federal court. They alleged Apple violated U.S. antitrust law through its agreements with PayPal's (PYPL.O) Venmo and Block's (SQ.N) Cash App.

Apple's agreements limit ""feature competition"" within peer-to-peer payment apps, including prohibiting existing or new platforms from using ""decentralized cryptocurrency technology,"" the complaint said.

The lawsuit seeks an injunction that could force Apple to divest or segregate its Apple Cash business.

Cupertino, California-based Apple, the only defendant in the case, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Representatives for PayPal and Block, which were not sued, did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

The plaintiffs' attorneys at the law firm Bathaee Dunne declined to comment.

The case adds to Apple's recent antitrust headaches. A U.S. judge in California in September ruled that payment card issuers can sue Apple over alleged anticompetitive practices involving its Apple Pay mobile wallet.

Apple in another case has asked the U.S. Supreme Court to overturn an order in a lawsuit from ""Fortnite"" video game maker Epic Games challenging restrictions on in-app payment processing.

Lawyers for the former US president Donald Trump urged a federal appeals court on Monday to revoke a gag order in the federal case charging him with plotting to overturn the results of the 2020 presidential election.

""The order is unprecedented and it sets a terrible precedent for future restrictions on core political speech,"" Trump's attorney John Sauer told a three-judge panel.

Prosecutors with the special counsel Jack Smith's team, meanwhile, are urging the court to put back in place an order barring Trump from making inflammatory statements about potential witnesses and lawyers in the case.

The prosecutors say those restrictions are necessary to prevent Trump from undermining confidence in the court system and intimidating people who may be called to testify against him.

Defense lawyers call the gag order an unconstitutional muzzling of Trump's free speech rights and say prosecutors have presented no evidence to support the idea that his words have caused harm or made anyone feel threatened.

During arguments on Monday, Sauer called the gag order a ""heckler's veto"", unfairly relying on the theory that Trump's speech might someday inspire other people to harass or intimidate his targets.

The three judges appeared skeptical of Sauer's arguments that the gag order was unconstitutional or had been entered without sufficient cause.

Judge Brad Garcia pressed Sauer to explain why the court ccould not take steps now before threats against those involved proliferate.

""This is predictably going to intensify as well as the threats, so why isn't the district court justified in taking a more proactive measure and not waiting for more and more threats to occur and stepping in to protect the integrity of the trial?"" he asked.

The gag order is one of multiple contentious issues being argued ahead of the landmark March 2024 trial. Defense lawyers are also trying to get the case dismissed by arguing that Trump, as a former president, is immune from prosecution and protected by the first amendment from being charged.

The outcome of Monday's arguments will not affect those constitutional claims, but it will set parameters on what Trump as both a criminal defendant and leading presidential candidate can and cannot say as the trial date nears.

The order has had a whirlwind trajectory through the courts since the US district judge Tanya Chutkan imposed it last month in response to a request from prosecutors, who cited among other comments Trump's repeated disparagement of Smith as ""deranged"".

The judge lifted it days after entering it, giving Trump's lawyers time to prove why his words should not be restricted. But after Trump took advantage of that pause by posting on social media comments that prosecutors said were meant to sway his former chief of staff against giving unfavorable testimony, Chutkan put it back in place.

The US court of appeals for the District of Columbia circuit later lifted it as it considered Trump's appeal.

The judges hearing the case include Cornelia Pillard and Patricia Millett, both appointees of Barack Obama, and Brad Garcia, who joined the bench earlier this year after being nominated by Joe Biden.

A dramatic video captured the moment a Georgia police officer saved a woman from a burning vehicle after she allegedly led him on a chase at speeds in excess of 100 mph in the Atlanta area.

The incident involving Officer Clay Musselman happened along the East-West Connector on Oct. 13, according to the Cobb County Police Department, who hailed his actions as going ""above and beyond the call of duty.""

Footage released by the department shows Musselman trailing a female driver in a high-speed pursuit before being told by a sergeant to not chase her any further.

Musselman could be seen approaching the vehicle after it failed to maneuver a corner in the road and crashed, bursting into flames.

""Come out, come out,"" he told the woman.

""I can't, my arm is broken,"" she replied as the flames raged around her.

""You have to, come on,"" Musselman responded.

The Prime Minister said he would do ""what is necessary"" to get the scheme off the ground amid reports of a Cabinet split over plans to override human rights laws.

The Government has promised a new treaty and emergency legislation to ensure the plan is legally watertight following a Supreme Court ruling against it last week.

But the promised new treaty with the African nation appears unlikely to be ratified before the new year and The Times reported that the domestic laws have run into Cabinet opposition.

Immigration minister Robert Jenrick is pushing for the legislation to disapply the Human Rights Act and direct courts to ignore the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) in asylum cases, but he is said to have faced opposition from Home Secretary James Cleverly, Attorney General Victoria Prentis and Justice Secretary Alex Chalk.

Asked about the report following a speech in London, Mr Sunak said: ""I'm completely committed to doing what is necessary to get those flights off and that scheme up and running.

""Because we have prepared for all circumstances we have been working on a new treaty with Rwanda that will address all the concerns that were raised by the Supreme Court, and we will combine that with new emergency legislation that will make it crystal clear - and give Parliament the opportunity to confirm - that Rwanda for all of these purposes is a safe place to implement our scheme.

""And I won't let a foreign court stop us from getting flights off to Rwanda.

""This is a reasonable country. This is a reasonable government.

""But people's patience has run thin and we have got to end this merry-go-round. And that is what I am determined to do.""

It was the UK Supreme Court, rather than ""a foreign court"", which dealt the latest blow to the Government's hopes of sending asylum seekers who arrive in the UK on a one-way trip to Rwanda.

But the Tories are keen to ensure that the ECHR and the Strasbourg court which rules on it will not prevent the policy - which was first announced in 2020 - from being implemented.

Mr Sunak has pinned his hopes on a new legally binding pact with Kigali alongside emergency legislation after the Supreme Court ruled the policy unlawful on November 15.

Downing Street had said in the hours after the defeat that the deal would be laid before Parliament in the ""coming days"" so removal flights can take off ""as soon as possible"".

But Whitehall sources said the treaty is not expected to be published until some time after Chancellor Jeremy Hunt details his set-piece financial announcement on Wednesday.

With the Commons due to rise for its Christmas recess on December 19, there are not enough sitting days to ratify the treaty before the new year under the current schedule, with No 10 saying at least 21 are legally required.

The source did not expect any problems getting Kigali to sign off on the treaty, believing that the emergency legislation is the greater challenge.

Labour's shadow home secretary Yvette Cooper said: ""This is just further chaos from the Conservatives. Further delay to a plan which has already failed.

Unlike all other federal judges, each Supreme Court justice is a judge unto himself or herself. An enforcement mechanism is needed for an ethics code to work.

Still, an uncodified potential enforcement procedure may be available, however flawed it might be sunlight.

Attorneys appearing before the court, including those filing amicus briefs, and other interested citizens can file fact-based motions seeking to use the new code to request a judge to recuse himself or herself for bias or the appearance of bias.

While there is no formal procedure for such motions, and they may be routinely denied, they can when publicized bring this issue to public attention. Hopefully, the embarrassment this might cause over time will force Congress to create a formal code with enforcement.

To the editor: Chemerinsky suggests ways for the Supreme Court to determine standards for the justices' recusals from controversial cases.

Perhaps the real problem lies in the appointment of malleable political jurists who adjust the form of the mantle that they wear due to their life appointment.

The signal disasters of the court -- the Dred Scott case, opening the gates of slavery to all states and territories, thus preordaining the Civil War; and Plessy vs. Ferguson, codifying and enshrining the inequality of the races for many decades -- came from justices who failed to act decently and morally.

Trump asked the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit to overturn or pause District Judge Tanya Chutkan's October limited gag order -- which is currently not in effect -- that would bar him from publicly targeting individual prosecutors, court staff, or potential witnesses tied to the 2020 election-related federal prosecution. The special counsel had urged Chutkan to impose even broader restrictions on the former president's pretrial speech, alleging his public comments threatened the proper administration of the judicial process and might inspire violence from supporters.

Her order did not go as far as prosecutors had requested, but Chutkan said she was treating the former president like any other defendant by preventing him from publicly speaking out against those who might testify against him at trial.

Trump's public targeting of the prosecution -- he has called Smith ""deranged"" and weighed in on reports that former White House chief of staff Mark Meadows cooperated with the probe -- and prosecutors' efforts to curtail him have injected partisan politics into what are at-times mundane pretrial scuffles over a defendant's freedoms.

""This is not about whether I like the language Mr. Trump uses,"" Chutkan said in an October hearing. ""This is about language that presents a danger to the administration of justice."" She said that part of her role is to protect the integrity of the judicial process, and freedom-of-speech protections ""yield"" when those principles are threatened.

The appeals court temporarily put the gag order on hold ahead of Monday's hearing at Trump's request, so it is currently not in effect.

Chutkan's order, Trump's attorneys argued in court filings, was ""muzzling President Trump's core political speech during an historic Presidential campaign"" and was ""viewpoint based.""

The prosecutors and potential witnesses whom Trump was barred from publicly targeting are high-level government officials, they said, and are thus linked to Trump's political campaign. Any restriction on Trump's speech, his defense attorneys argue, limits his right to campaign freely.

""The district court cannot silence President Trump based solely on the anticipated reaction of his audiences. The district court lacks the authority to muzzle the core political speech of the leading candidate for President at the height of his re-election campaign,"" Trump's attorneys argued in court filings. ""President Trump is entitled to proclaim, and the American public is entitled to hear, his core political messages. The Gag Order should be immediately reversed.""

But Smith's team has increasingly worked to tie Trump's public rhetoric to threats of violence, alleging his supporters' reactions to his criticisms could affect the way the trial -- currently set for March 2024 -- proceeds.

Trump, the special counsel alleged, is aware that his language might inspire others to act and ""seeks to use this well-known dynamic to his advantage."" Citing threats to Judge Chutkan herself, prosecutors write that the pattern ""continued unabated as this case and other unrelated cases involving the defendant have progressed.""

Rebutting Trump's claims of First Amendment protection, prosecutors told the appeals court earlier this month, ""The defendant does not need to explicitly incite threats or violence in his public statements, because he well knows that, by publicly targeting perceived adversaries with inflammatory language, he can maintain a patina of plausible deniability while ensuring the desired results.""

Smith's team argued the former president's current campaign to win the office again is not a sufficient reason to grant him extensive pretrial privileges.

In a filing Friday, Trump's team countered, ""The First Amendment does not permit the district court to micromanage President Trump's core political speech"" and said Smith's argument in favor of the order was based on, ""hearsay media reports as a substitute for evidence.""

Trump's motion to stay the gag order received support last week from more than a dozen Republican state attorneys general who echoed his argument that the restrictions on his speech unduly affect voters in primary states.

Spearheaded by Iowa's attorney general, the group - at least six of whom have endorsed Trump - wrote in an amicus brief, ""Our citizens have an interest in hearing from major political candidates in that election. The Order threatens the States' interests by infringing on President Trump's free speech rights.""

Trump has also found an unlikely ally in the American Civil Liberties Union, which brought scores of legal challenges to Trump's policies while he was in office. In the friend-of-the-court brief the ACLU sought to submit to the district court -- the request to file the brief was ultimately denied -- the organization said that Chutkan's order is unconstitutionally vague and impermissibly broad.

The authorities in China have imposed tight controls on expression and views any form of public outcry as a risk to social stability

China’s public prosecutors have been warned to be alert to the risk of a popular backlash when handling court cases.

The Chinese government has imposed some of the world’s strictest controls on public expression, but is still hyper sensitive to the risk of any public outcry, which it fears could threaten social stability.

The instruction to prosecutors came in a front-page editorial for The Procuratorial Daily, a mouthpiece for the country’s top prosecuting body, the Supreme People’s Procuratorate.

The article urged prosecutors to “resolutely oppose and resist wrong Western views of constitutionalism, the separation of powers and judicial independence”, echoing comments by President Xi Jinping.

In a further echo of Xi, it also said prosecutors should “dare to fight and fight well”.

They were also urged to standardise the handling of cases, ensure they are handled well and avoid a public backlash by ensuring cases are dealt with properly from the start.

It added that China’s prosecutors should improve their research and monitoring of cases and make sure they manage public opinion.Chinese prosecutors zero in on environmental crime cases, report says

“Ensure early detection, a quick response, correct guidance of the public and the proper handling of cases according to the law,” the editorial said.

In addition, it called for propaganda efforts by prosecutors to increase public recognition of the country’s legal system.

China’s prosecutors’ offices – also known as procuratorates – are an essential part of the judicial system but a number of miscarriages of justice have caused public concern.

It is exceptionally rare for defendants to be acquitted and the conviction rate in Chinese courts stood at 99.95 per cent last year, according to the Law Yearbook of China.

In February 2022, the Supreme People’s Procuratorate said it was taking disciplinary action against those responsible for 246 wrongful convictions that had been identified since 2018. Of these cases, 22 involved defendants who were jailed for more than 10 years.

In 2020 a court in the eastern province of Shandong freed a man named Zhang Zhichao who had spent 13 years in prison after being wrongly convicted of the rape and murder of a schoolgirl in 2006, a case that triggered an extensive media and public outcry.

Last year, 10 prosecutors at different levels in Shandong were subjected to disciplinary action over their handling of the case, but were not removed from their posts.

It was the most recent case where action is known to have been taken against prosecutors

In recent years, several local procuratorates have made public pledges to do a better job of managing public opinion. Government tender records show that some regional procuratorates have paid for services to analyse public opinion.

In March, an article for the official Legal Daily newspaper said cases that generated widespread public interest were the main source of a public outcry over court proceedings.China’s top legislature fills prosecutor, judge and anti-graft positions

However, it said that the police and courts rather than prosecutors were the main targets of public outrage.

The publication also warned that failing to respond to public concerns about court cases had also had an impact and reduced awareness of the work prosecutors do.","{'uri': 'scmp.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'South China Morning Post'}",[],https://cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/d8/images/canvas/2023/11/20/875d9659-b8ba-4a0e-b5ed-5745be468706_624ae301.jpg?itok=cYQRZlXu,,-0.1764705882352942,25,25,South China Morning Post,scmp.com

The prime minister is said to be under pressure to use emergency legislation to disapply the Human Rights Act and tell courts to ignore the European Convention on Human Rights in asylum cases.

A senior government source told The Times the strategy was ""mad"", saying the courts would go ""ballistic"" and questioning whether Mr Sunak would be willing to endorse it.

Another warned that the plan could lead to more legal challenges which would delay the Rwanda scheme further, saying: ""There's a real danger in sounding tough but failing to deliver.""

It comes after Mr Sunak promised emergency legislation to deem Rwanda a ""safe"" country and a new treaty with Kigali in a bid to address issues that led the UK's highest court to rule the deportation scheme was unlawful.

But Suella Braverman, who was sacked as home secretary last week, claimed the PM's ""Plan B"" is ""simply a tweaked version of the failed Plan A"".

He is considering a plan to defy the UK's Human Rights Act as part of a desperate push to get deportation flights off the ground.

But, as Mr Sunak considers blocking human rights laws as part of the push, a Conservative Party source told the Guardian: ""This would tear the party apart. Several cabinet ministers and the [moderate] One Nationers would not stand for it - the prime minister wouldn't even get it through the Commons. Never mind that this wouldn't placate the head-bangers on the right either.""

Mr Sunak's updated Rwanda treaty is expected to be presented to MPs this week after chancellor Jeremy Hunt's autumn statement.

The treaty is expected to attempt to address the Supreme Court's concerns around ""refoulement"" - the potential for refugees rejected by Rwanda to be sent back to the country they are fleeing.

Asked on Sunday whether the government would go further and leave the ECHR, Mr Hunt said: ""We don't believe at this stage that that is necessary ... We don't believe it will come to that, at this stage - we don't want to do that.""

However, the chancellor added that the government was determined to stop ""foreign judges"" from deciding who comes to the UK.

Digging out forgotten laws from dusty shelves and freshening them up with some trendy security elements has become the latest fashion for Communist Party rulers in China.

It happened as President Xi Jinping called on officials to prepare for “worst-case and most extreme scenarios,” in other words, an unprecedented security threat posed by the United States and other Western powers.

Whether the threats are imaginary or more real than ever, scrambling to expand legal tool kits appears sensible to a Chinese leadership eager to rationalise its moves and defend itself from spies or other forms of external infiltration.

The latest law to be refashioned was China’s State Secrets Law. A dozen new clauses have been added in a draft revision unveiled in late October, the biggest amendment to the statute in over a decade after it was first introduced in 1988.

Education, technology and military facilities, among other areas, were all covered as the draft expanded the reach and depth of the law.

But what constitutes a “state secret” is never clearly defined – making one wonder if anything could be counted when necessary – as Beijing sees itself locked in an intelligence war with Washington.

One clause stipulates that all state employees with access to state secrets are banned from leaving China without prior approval, with the rule applying for some time even after changing jobs or retiring.

Money must be set aside to guard government information from the county level and above, another burdensome administrative cost for local governments that are already facing insolvency after investing all they had into fighting the coronavirus.Chinese lawmakers review proposed changes to state secrets law

The drafted law provides the National Administration of State Secret Protection – a once low-profile office under the State Council, China’s cabinet – with authority to check and question all when it comes to guarding whatever is deemed secret enough to warrant it.

Information security, meanwhile, has also been made a national priority, and funds are being allocated to develop cutting-edge technologies specifically for the purpose of data safety.

Echoing this move, a dozen leading universities have set up national security studies as a new discipline to train young scholars, following the Education Ministry’s call in 2021 to cultivate talent in that arena.

As Beijing faces what it calls “unprecedented uncertainties”, it seems determined to augment its toolbox on state security.

The revised law on state secrets is likely to sail unopposed through the country’s legislative process, as have other laws that have had new coats of national security-tinted paint.China charities to be overseen by police, spy agencies under proposed law change

A law governing charities was also chosen for revision in October, with new clauses on having police and state security forces oversee charities in addition to other potential watchdogs, including the taxation and cyberspace administrations.

But the most high-profile amendment in recent months is the one levied on the anti-espionage law, which came into effect in July after its third revision since its introduction in 2014.

The sweeping law expanded the definition of a threat and lists cyberattacks by a “spying entity or its surrogate” as an act of espionage for the first time, sending foreign investors’ confidence to new lows amid a sagging post-pandemic economic recovery. Premier Li Qiang’s 31- point plan to boost business sentiment has not eased worries to the degree China had hoped.

As lawmakers ponder which piece of legislation is due for the next makeover, chilling effects are being felt in the business world. Raids were carried out earlier this year against leading US consulting firms Bain & Company, Capvision and the Mintz Group, whose Asia operations were formerly run by CIA veteran Randal Phillips.

More employees at foreign firms have been banned from leaving China, including US financial and risk consulting firms Kroll and Japanese financial firm Nomura Holdings.Chinese securities not ‘must-haves’ any more as wary investors look elsewhere

A sense of paranoia and uncertainty is scaring away foreign capital – which China has relied on over the past four decades as one of its critical engines for economic growth.

Foreign businesses are considering downsizing their China offices or closing them for good, fearing an increasingly unpredictable environment will make it challenging to carry out their affairs.

The expansion of Beijing’s legal tool kit can be traced back to 2021, as the new Data Security Law stipulated that companies transferring the state’s “core data” overseas without approval would have to pay a penalty of up to 10 million yuan (US$1.37 million) and could be forced to shut down.

The law laid the foundation for officials to tighten data management and propose more industry-specific regulations, such as the Finance Ministry and cyberspace watchdog saying in mid-November that auditing firms should undergo scrutiny.Spy games: why the US-China cold war is heating up in public

China’s top spy agency has also emerged from the shadows and announced several espionage cases, including the capture of two CIA agents in August.

The agency’s chief justified the moves as China having to proactively defend against spies as risks arise in a more unpredictable global environment.

The State Security Ministry brushed aside concerns, saying that the law protected suspects’ rights and set out the process for investigating state security cases.

In a seemingly “grim and complex” state, deemed such by Communist Party leaders, the changes seem to be another example of prioritising politics over economy. The consequences, as always, will remain to be seen.60-Second Catch-up

In another sign of the dismal state of US-China relations, public espionage disclosures have increased markedly in recent months on both sides of the Pacific as spy agencies that once lurked in the dark openly tout their handiwork.

Behind the strategic leaks and veneer of transparency is a shadow play mirroring the broader geopolitics, as intelligence communities face pressure to look effective at home and tough abroad, with little sign that the spy-versus-spy showdown will end any time soon, security analysts and former spies said.

Buck Aldridge fatally shot Leonard Cure during a roadside struggle after pulling him over for speeding, it wasn´t the first time a traffic stop involving the Camden County sheriff's deputy had spiraled into violence.

Last year, Aldridge dragged a driver from a car that crashed after fleeing the deputy on Interstate 95. Body and dash camera video obtained by The Associated Press show the driver on his back as Aldridge punches him. Records indicate the deputy faced no disciplinary action.

Personnel records show Aldridge was fired in August 2017 by a police department in the same Georgia county after he threw a woman to the ground and handcuffed her during a traffic stop. The Camden County Sheriff's Office hired him nine months later.

Aldridge stopped Cure for speeding Oct. 16 and ended up shocking the 53-year-old Black man with a Taser after he refused to put his hands behind him to be cuffed. Body and dash camera videos show Cure fought back and had a hand at the deputy's throat when Aldridge shot him point-blank.

Relatives have said Cure likely resisted because of psychological trauma from spending 16 years imprisoned in Florida for an armed robbery he didn´t commit. Officials exonerated and freed him in 2020.

The Georgia Bureau of Investigation is investigating Cure's death and will submit its findings to prosecutors. Aldridge's attorney said the video shows he fired in self-defense. Regardless, critics question whether he should have been wearing a badge given his history of aggression.

The deputy shot the Black man at point-blank range during a traffic stop after the man, who had been wrongfully imprisoned years ago, grabbed the officer by the neck and was forcing his head backward, according to video released by a sheriff. (Camden County Sheriff's Office via AP)

""This guy should have never been on the force,"" said Timothy Bessent Sr., president of Camden County´s NAACP chapter.

The AP obtained Aldridge's personnel records as well as reports and videos from the June 2022 chase and arrest using Georgia's open records law.

A former U.S. Marine, Aldridge, 41, worked nearly five years for the Kingsland Police Department in Georgia's southeast corner. His file shows Aldridge was disciplined for using unnecessary force in February 2014 and May 2017. The second time he was suspended for three days without pay.

The department fired Aldridge for his third infraction just three months later. Police records say Aldridge was assisting with a traffic stop when he tried to handcuff a woman - not to arrest her, but to keep her outside her car. One deputy told investigators Aldridge cuffed the woman after ""picking her up and throwing her on the ground."" She was cited for letting an unlicensed person drive her car.

Aldridge was hired by the sheriff's office in May 2018. He disclosed his firing on his job application.

Aldridge's termination wouldn't automatically disqualify him from working for another agency, though some would consider it a huge liability, said retired police Maj. Neill Franklin.

""If someone´s terminated from another police department for use of excessive force, they´re not getting hired by the Maryland State Police or the Baltimore Police Department,"" said Franklin, who led training programs for both agencies. ""It's just not worth the risk.""

Bessent and other advocates say it´s an example of Camden County Sheriff Jim Proctor tolerating unnecessary violence.

Proctor, who has been sheriff for a decade, declined to comment. Spokesman Capt. Larry Bruce cited the investigation into Cure's death and pending civil litigation involving other deputies.

Since last year, six Camden County deputies have been indicted on felony charges and fired for violence against jail detainees and a motorist.

In September 2022, jail security cameras recorded guards rushing into the cell of Jarrett Hobbs, who was punched in the head and neck and hurled against a wall. Hobbs was charged with assaulting jailers until his attorney obtained the video. His charges were dropped, and three deputies were indicted.

Two more jailers were charged and fired for incidents in March and July. Security video showed one push a detainee to the floor and punch him before another guard intervened. The other deputy shoved a handcuffed detainee headfirst into a door, knocking him unconscious.

""You´ve got these deputies running wild and doing what they want to do,"" said Harry Daniels, a civil rights attorney who won a legal settlement for Hobbs. ""The consequences have come from the GBI and the district attorney´s office. It should not come from an outside agency.""

He points to Christine Newman, named ""Deputy of the Month"" two months after a dash camera recorded her slapping a handcuffed driver across the face and slamming the woman's head into a patrol SUV. The driver had refused to exit her vehicle after being pulled over for a rolling stop Jan. 16, 2022.

Newman was fired a year later after being indicted on charges including aggravated assault and violating her oath of office. She has pleaded not guilty. Newman's attorney, Robert Persse, called her a ""loyal deputy"" whom he looks forward to defending in court.

The number of deputies facing charges ""indicates a culture that may not encourage use of force, but certainly tolerates inappropriate use of force,"" said retired LaGrange, Georgia, Police Chief Louis Dekmar.

""If folks are held accountable and there are clear lines, you generally don´t see that in law enforcement agencies,"" said Dekmar, a former president of the International Association of Chiefs of Police.

A spike in claims involving the sheriff's office caused Camden County's government to get dropped by its insurance company in July, said Mike Spiers, the county's risk management director. The county got new policies, he said, but its deductible for liability jumped from $25,000 per claim to $250,000.

Aldridge was placed on administrative leave while the GBI investigates Cure's death.

""Buck Aldridge is a fine officer and the video speaks for itself,"" said Adrienne Browning, Aldridge's attorney. ""It´s clear his life was in danger and he defended himself.""

Video released of the fatal confrontation along I-95 shows Aldridge telling Cure he's being charged with reckless driving for speeding in excess of 100 mph (161 kph). Cure argues, but obeys commands to get out and put his hands on his truck. However, he ignores commands to put his hands behind him.

That's when Aldridge fires his Taser into Cure's back. Cure fights back, and video shows them grappling beside the highway. Cure maintains a grip on Aldridge's face and neck after being struck with a baton.

""Yeah, bitch!"" Cure says. Then he slumps to the ground after Aldridge fires a single shot.

Dekmar, Franklin and a third expert told AP they believe the shooting was legal, as Aldridge appeared to be in danger when he fired. But they also criticized how Aldridge began the encounter by shouting at Cure and said made no effort to deescalate.

""He escalated the situation with Mr. Cure,"" said former Memphis police officer Thaddeus Johnson, a criminal justice professor at Georgia State University and a senior fellow for the Council on Criminal Justice. ""He has no control over his emotions.""

Johnson said Aldridge showed a similar lack of control during a June 2022 arrest after chasing two speeding cars.

After one car crashes, body and dash camera video shows Aldridge shouting expletives as he approaches with his gun drawn. The driver is on his back when Aldridge starts dragging him headfirst from the car, then punches him.

The driver resists being cuffed but complies after another deputy's dog bites him and Aldridge shocks him with a Taser. The driver was charged with drug trafficking, reckless driving and fleeing an officer.

Aldridge was promoted to staff sergeant two months later. His sheriff's personnel file shows no disciplinary actions.

Johnson said he sees no justification for Aldridge punching the arrested driver. Even if prosecutors don't charge him in Cure's death, he said, ""from what I saw in the video, he deserves to be fired.""

""We have to hold officers to a higher standard,"" Johnson said, ""even though they are human.""

The high court is to consider for the first time whether universities owe a legal duty of care to their students, which campaigners argue would save lives and bring England and Wales in line with other countries.

The landmark hearing next month comes at a time of widespread concern about declining student mental health and a number of widely reported suicides, including that of Natasha Abrahart, 20, who was a second year physics student at Bristol University when she killed herself in 2018.

Bereaved families, including Natasha's parents, Robert and Margaret Abrahart, argue a statutory duty of care would oblige university staff to exercise reasonable care and avoid acts that could foreseeably cause students harm.

In May last year, the Abraharts successfully sued Bristol University under the Equality Act for not taking reasonable care of their daughter's wellbeing, health and safety. Natasha, who had chronic social anxiety, took her own life a day before she was due to give an oral exam in front of teachers and fellow students.

The Abraharts were awarded £50,000 in damages by the county court and have been granted permission by the high court to appeal against a separate finding that the university did not owe their daughter a legal duty of care under the law of negligence. The three-day hearing, which is due to start on 11 December in Bristol, will also consider an appeal by Bristol University against the earlier finding that it breached the Equality Act.

In a separate move, the Equality and Human Rights Commission has been granted permission to intervene in what it described as a ""landmark legal case"" that could have far-reaching implications.

A University of Bristol spokesperson said the circumstances of Natasha's death were not disputed. ""In appealing, we are seeking absolute clarity for the higher education sector around the application of the Equality Act when staff do not know a student has a disability, or when it has yet to be diagnosed.

""We hope it will also enable us to provide transparency to students and their families about how we support them and to give all university staff across the country the confidence to do that properly.""

The legal duty of care issue was debated in Westminster this year after parents and supporters gathered more than 128,000 signatures in a parliamentary petition calling for its introduction. At the end, however, the government said it had no plans for new legislation.

Robert Abrahart, a retired university lecturer from Nottingham, said: ""Like many other parents we were appalled to learn that universities don't already owe a legal duty to exercise reasonable care and skill in the way they treat their students. We are delighted that the high court has agreed to consider whether such a duty should now be imposed. If this happens it will not only save lives but it will bring universities in England and Wales into line with their counterparts in Australia and the USA.""

Margaret Abrahart, a retired psychological wellbeing practitioner, added: ""We need something positive to come from the nightmare of Natasha's death. We have petitioned parliament, we've spoken with political parties, and now we're trying to do what we can through the courts. We don't expect universities to treat students like children and don't think lecturers should have parental responsibility. We just want to see a common sense legal duty on universities to take reasonable steps not to harm their students.""

Gus Silverman, of the law firm Deighton Pierce Glynn, who is representing the Abraharts, said: ""The University of Bristol told the county court that it didn't owe any relevant duty to care for its students under the law of negligence. Now the high court will consider, for the first time, whether that is correct.""

Bristol University said its staff helped Natasha with a referral to both the NHS and the university's disability services, and suggested alternative options for her academic assessment to alleviate her anxiety. ""However the judgment suggests they should have gone further than this, although Natasha's mental health difficulties had not been diagnosed. Understandably, this has caused considerable anxiety as it puts a major additional burden on staff who are primarily educators, not healthcare professionals,"" the spokesperson said.

""Collectively, we are deeply concerned by the increase of mental health issues amongst our young people nationally and are determined to do our very best to support any student who is struggling with their mental health through the provision of a wide range of services. At the same time, it is important that students and their families are clear on what universities can and cannot do, and that students receive appropriate specialist care under the NHS should they need it.""

Shakeira Yvonne Rucker, 37, was found dead inside a storage unit at the Self Storage on Wiggins Road in Apopka, Florida, the Orange County Sheriff's Office said in a Saturday Facebook post. The Sheriff's Office is now investigating Rucker's case as a homicide.

""This is not the update we wanted to be giving you all today,"" Orange County Sheriff John Mina announced at a press conference Sunday, adding that the story has had a lot of ""twists and turns"" over the last week and has covered many jurisdictions.

Police had just finished searching for Rucker in an area near Bob White Airfield in Mt. Dora, Florida, on Saturday when they got a 911 call from someone at the Self Storage reporting ""a smell emanating from one of the units,"" Mina said.

Orange County sheriff's deputies responded to the call and found Rucker dead in the unit from apparent gunshot wounds, Mina said. He noted that that a full autopsy is underway.

Officials said the storage unit belonged to her estranged husband, Cory Hill, the prime suspect in Rucker's murder, and that he has not been cooperative in the investigation.

The killing took place at the storage unit, Mina said. No motive was announced.

""He is the suspect. We are not looking for anyone else. He will be charged with the murder eventually in this case,"" Mina said.

The public defender's office representing Hill did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the case.

Mina said Hill is already in the Orange County Jail, charged with four counts of attempted homicide for shooting at his ""girlfriend and family"" on Nov. 12. According to Orange County jail records, he was booked on Nov. 13.

NBC affiliate WESH reported that Hill was shooting at a former girlfriend and her family in that case. The Orange County Sheriff's Office did not immediately respond to a request for clarification Sunday night.

Rucker, whom WESH reported was a mother of four, was first reported missing after her family said they last saw her on Nov. 11, according to a Facebook post from the Winter Springs Police Department. Police said she was last seen leaving her Winter Springs home that day, and her family believed she had been with Hill.

""It's not the outcome we expected, but there's a little bit of closure for Shakeira's family,"" WSPD Chief of Police Matthew Tracht said Sunday.

Tracht said the team worked 16-to-18-hour days to find Rucker and worked across four counties, including Orange, Seminole, Polk and Lake counties. They also got help from the Mt. Dora Police Department, the Floria Department of Law Enforcement and the FBI, he said.","{'uri': 'nbcnews.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'NBC News'}",[],"https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_nbcnews-fp-1024-512,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2023-11/231119-FLORIDA-WOMAN-DEAD-STORAGE-UNIT-RC-1138P-ce1dee.png",eng-9075051,-0.3176470588235294,25,25,NBC News,nbcnews.com

Hong Kong prides itself on being a diverse international city with laws designed to ensure equal treatment. The Equal Opportunities Commission (EOC) is responsible for overseeing legislation in specific areas.

The city has laws against discrimination on the grounds of sex, disability, family status and race. But the commission’s work has, for years, gone beyond those areas, covering research into other types of discrimination, such as on the grounds of sexual orientation or age.

The study of these pressing issues and the possibility of new legislation would appear to be a natural part of the commission’s activities. It is perfectly placed to investigate such matters.

But the EOC had been advised by the Department of Justice that work of this kind goes beyond the legal remit of the organisation. It cannot stray further than the legislation already in place.

Work on legal amendments to protect the LGBTQ community, ongoing for more than 18 months, has been stopped as a result of the advice, which the commission’s own lawyers agree with.Hong Kong equality body told to back off from law changes to protect LGBTQ people

Commission chairman Ricky Chu Man-kin, speaking at a panel discussion on diversity and inclusion to mark the 120th anniversary of the South China Morning Post, said the body was now looking at existing laws instead, to see if they could be applied.

The commission has, in the past, researched discrimination on the grounds of sexual orientation, publishing a report in 2016 calling for legislation. It has also made submissions to UN institutions on the issue. No laws have been passed.

Another study commissioned by the EOC in 2016, highlighted significant levels of age discrimination and showed strong public support for new laws to combat it.

The fight against discrimination is not frozen in time or limited to four areas. The EOC should be permitted to explore the development and expansion of Hong Kong’s legal armoury against unequal treatment. This may require an amendment to the law to broaden its mandate to that extent.

A landmark ruling by the top court in September required the government to develop a framework for recognising “core rights” of same-sex couples.

Other court decisions have outlawed discrimination against members of the LGBTQ community in specific areas. It would make sense for a law on discrimination on the grounds of sexual orientation to form part of steps to be taken in this area.

A recent study showed 71 per cent of the community to be in favour of such a law.

The commission should be at the heart of promoting and preventing discrimination of all kinds. It is well-positioned to conduct research and make proposals that enhance Hong Kong’s international reputation by furthering diversity and inclusion.","{'uri': 'scmp.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'South China Morning Post'}",[],https://cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/og_image_scmp_editorial/public/d8/images/canvas/2023/11/19/5a9eab08-2172-4caa-ba7c-4eb7e7fef7dc_1da8e3bf.jpg?itok=mF_oS77Q&v=1700405430,,0.4352941176470588,25,25,South China Morning Post,scmp.com

Rishi Sunak is considering blocking a key human rights law to help force through plans to send asylum seekers to Rwanda amid growing pressure from rightwing Conservative MPs.

No 10 has discussed the possibility of ""disapplying"" the Human Rights Act to an emergency bill in an effort to minimise legal challenges against the prime minister's key immigration policy. Ministers are aware such a proposal could face rebellions in the Commons and the Lords, which could vote down the proposals.

A Conservative party source said: ""This would tear the party apart. Several cabinet ministers and the one nationers would not stand for it - the prime minister wouldn't even get it through the Commons. Never mind that this wouldn't placate the head bangers on the right either.""

The government's quandary has emerged as a former supreme court judge said the proposals to send people seeking asylum to the east African country with no possibility of a return to the UK were ""probably dead"".

The prime minister is under intense pressure from the Conservative right to get the scheme working as part of his pledge to ""stop the boats"" amid the Channel asylum seeker crisis. Right-leaning MPs are demanding that a flight takes off for Kigali before the next general election, which is expected to take place before the end of 2024.

It follows a ruling by the UK's highest court on Wednesday that Sunak's flagship policy is unlawful because of the possibility of ""refoulement"" - that refugees are at risk of being sent back to their country of origin by the Rwandan government.

Refoulement is prohibited by international laws, including the European convention on human rights (ECHR), the UN refugee convention and the UN convention against torture, which have been given effect in domestic law by the Human Rights Act.

Discussions about blocking the Human Rights Act had taken place in Downing Street since the ruling, sources said.

Hours after the court ruling, Sunak said he would upgrade the agreement with the Rwandan government to a treaty and launch an emergency bill within weeks to prevent court challenges. Ministers are looking at requiring MPs to sit on Fridays and reordering the parliamentary timetable to accelerate a new bill.

Party sources said they were aware that dozens of Tory MPs could vote with Labour to block any such change. Any block on human rights laws could also face objections in the House of Lords because of mounting concern it would breach the UK's international law obligations under the ECHR.

The hard-right New Conservatives grouping demanded that Sunak's new legislation ""must disapply the Human Rights Act"", while the former home secretary Suella Braverman, who was sacked by Sunak last week, said the new bill must exclude all avenues of legal challenge.

When approached by the Guardian, No 10 declined to comment.

The former supreme court judge Lord Sumption said of the Rwanda plan: ""I think the current Rwanda scheme is probably dead, but we obviously have to suspend judgment until we see what this legislation or this new treaty looks like."" He also suggested judges in Strasbourg would come to a similar view of the scheme's legality as UK supreme court justices.

He told Sky News: ""The government have made clear ... that they don't intend to do that [withdraw from the ECHR]. Although the government may well ignore interim orders from Strasbourg, they presumably intend to comply with final orders from Strasbourg. It [the Strasbourg court] will investigate safety for itself and probably arrive at a conclusion very similar to that of the supreme court.""

He said he was ""sceptical"" of reported plans to send British civil servants to work in the east African country, adding: ""The main problem [with the] scheme is that it outsources to Rwanda the decision about whether people have refugee status.""

Speaking on Sunday, Jeremy Hunt, the chancellor, defended the government's plans for emergency legislation and added that the government did not want to leave the ECHR despite calls from the right of the Conservative party.

""I think we will see that, because I do think, when you interview me next year, we will be having a discussion about how we have succeeded in this plan, and I will be saying: look, it wasn't easy, we kept at it, but that is what we promise to do,"" he told the BBC's Laura Kuenssberg.

Ministers are under pressure to process the asylum claims of tens of thousands of people who arrived in the UK after the illegal migration act was passed in July.

Immigration experts said ministers could be in breach of the UN refugee convention because asylum seekers were being held - in some cases in detention centres - indefinitely. They have no prospect of being removed to a third safe country or being granted access to the asylum system in the UK under the act.

Enver Solomon, the chief executive of the Refugee Council, said: ""The Illegal Migration Act is unfair, unworkable, and expensive. It's causing huge distress and anxiety for those we support with rising levels of acute mental health problems for already traumatised men, women and children. There are serious questions about the legality of leaving people in this situation indefinitely and the government should swiftly take action by allowing them all to be given a fair hearing in the asylum system and treated with compassion and dignity.""","{'uri': 'theguardian.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","[{'uri': 'rajeev_syal@theguardian.com', 'name': 'Rajeev Syal', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': False}]",https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c555c48e9f8b37febf5ffe88f9b9a6f356b9dde0/0_100_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&s=da41a57f11aec94b16b8b76b92291cd3,eng-9074973,-0.1294117647058823,25,25,The Guardian,theguardian.com

The first was a shooting which occurred at approximately 6:30 p.m. in the parking lot of the KFC restaurant located at Federal Blvd and 92nd Avenue. Per Westminster PD, its officers found an adult male who had been shot and began performing CPR.

That male later died at a hospital.

Police have little information on who may have shot him. At this point, officers have only been told that two males were seen running from the scene. One was wearing a grey hooded sweatshirt and the other wearing all red clothing.

An hour and a half after the Westminster shooting, a person was shot in the 11800 block of Washington Street. That person was also pronounced at a hospital.

Just before 9 p.m., Northglenn officers were sent to the area of 117th Avenue and Delaware Court. There, the bodies of a man and woman were found inside a home.

Nov 19 (Reuters) - A Missouri jury ordered Bayer to pay $1.56 billion to four plaintiffs who claimed the company's Roundup weedkiller caused injuries including cancer, a verdict that could intensify investor pressure on the German drugs and agricultural chemicals company to change its legal strategy.

The Cole County, Missouri jury found on Friday that Bayer's Monsanto business was liable for claims of negligence, design defects and failing to warn plaintiffs of the potential dangers of using Roundup, according to court documents.

Valorie Gunther of New York, Jimmy Draeger of Missouri and Daniel Anderson of California were awarded a combined $61.1 million in compensatory damages and $500 million each in punitive damages. Each was diagnosed with non-Hodgkin lymphoma that they alleged was caused by using Roundup on their family property. Draeger's wife Brenda was awarded $100,000 for the harm she allegedly suffered from her husband's disease.

The punitive damages could be reduced on appeal as it exceeds U.S. Supreme Court guidance.

Bayer has said that decades of studies have shown Roundup and its active ingredient, glyphosate, are safe for human use.

The verdict is the fourth straight loss in court for Bayer, after the company had been found not liable to plaintiffs in nine consecutive trials. Earlier this month, Union Investment, one of Bayer's top 10 shareholders, called on the company to consider trying to engage with plaintiffs to settle more cases.

Bart Rankin, partner at Forrest Weldon which represented the plaintiffs, said in a statement the victory was the first of many on behalf of thousands of plaintiffs.

Bayer said in a statement that it has strong arguments to get the recent verdicts overturned on appeal.

It said in the recent trials that have gone against the company, courts have improperly permitted plaintiffs to misrepresent the European Union's renewal process for glyphosate and the safety assessment by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.

The EU Commission said last week it would renew its approval of glyphosate based on safety assessments of the European Food Agency and European Chemicals Agency after EU member states failed to give a clear opinion on the renewal.

Around 165,000 claims have been made against the company for personal injuries allegedly caused by Roundup, which Bayer acquired as part of its $63 billion purchase of agrochemical company Monsanto in 2018.

In 2020, Bayer settled most of the then-pending Roundup cases for up to $10.9 billion. Around 50,000 claims remain pending, according to regulatory filings.

The argument between the two cooks started over potato croquettes and resulted in one man strangling and punching his kitchen colleague.

Rashim Salim, 35, and his victim, known only as Mr Bardu, threw potatoes at each other just before he lunged for the man.

Salim was handed an 18-month community sentence at Reading crown court for the assault causing actual bodily harm, which he admitted.

The judge heard he had grabbed his colleague by the throat and punched him three times in the incident on January 27 at the 38-bedroom Cantley House Hotel in upmarket Wokingham, Berkshire.

Judge Joanna Matson heard how Salim, of Challener Road, High Wycombe, was involved in a heated argument with Mr Barbu.

The confrontation spiralled with a row over potatoes and croquettes taking place.

Prosecutor Shaan Sethi described the incident to the court, saying that Salim had 'grabbed the complainant by the neck and squeezed' before punching him in the torso three times.

However, Judge Matson stated that after checking the CCTV footage from the incident that the strangulation was not prolonged.

Defence counsel for Salim, Adele Pullarp told the court that Salim was holding down two jobs that helped to pay child maintenance costs for his older children.

The judge heard that he had been diagnosed with stage five kidney failure in 2020 and had to undergo dialysis.

She added that he was a successful chef who had maintained a romantic relationship over the last five years.

The judge heard that Salim had previous convictions for violence from 2015 but these were not taken as an aggravating factor by the court.

Salim was ordered to complete 15 rehabilitation activity requirement days, 140 hours of unpaid work and to pay £120 in compensation to Mr Barbu.","{'uri': 'metro.co.uk', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'Metro'}","[{'uri': 'alan_shields@metro.co.uk', 'name': 'Alan Shields', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': False}]",https://metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/SEC_180860634-13dc.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1,,-0.3098039215686275,25,25,Metro,metro.co.uk

The Coalition had been hammering the Albanese government for not being better prepared in the event of losing the case and that they should have had legislation ready to go.

The opposition leader, Peter Dutton, suggested the critical date was June - because that was when a preliminary hearing suggested the case was on ""shaky ground"".

At that hearing justice Jacqueline Gleeson said the chances of the government being able to deport the plaintiff, NZYQ - which is supposed to be the purpose of immigration detention - seemed ""hopeless"".

It troubled her that ""no one may be turning their mind to the inevitable deterioration of a person who is in a situation of hopelessness"".

But there were warning bells long before about how shaky the 2004 decision of Al-Kateb - which determined indefinite immigration detention was lawful - really was.

The shadow immigration minister, Dan Tehan, last week gave another critical date: Labor ""had a briefing in 2021, when they were in opposition, which showed that this decision was possible"".

Labor's Matt Keogh correctly identified that this was an admission by the Coalition that it had ""received advice in 2021 in relation to these issues"".

It's worth remembering the solicitor general, the second law officer, gets to read over what his or her predecessors thought about the big legal issues.

The upshot is Labor and the Coalition were likely told the same thing about the legal foundation of indefinite detention.

Was the high court's decision to strike down Al-Kateb a day that both major parties knew would come?

The original decision of Al-Kateb was decided by the narrowest of margins, four justices to three. The legal community was always sceptical that they'd got it right.

Proper full high court reconsideration of it proved elusive. Cases that came closest were distinguishable on their facts, decided another way, or the plaintiffs released. But still, there was a rumble of discontent with the decision.

In the case of another plaintiff, known as M47, justice Virginia Bell said two of the majority judges didn't pay enough attention to the ""principle of legality"", that depriving a person of liberty required clearer words. She would have overturned Al-Kateb.

The case law on separation of powers, which ended up being the winning argument, got stronger and stronger.

Eventually, it became clear that it would take somebody in exactly the same situation as Al-Kateb to come before the court: someone who it was not practical to deport, and for who there was no real prospect of that changing in the foreseeable future.

In December 2022 the federal court made such a finding about an Egyptian man named Tony Sami.

As he prepared to take his case to the high court, he was deported ""unwillingly"" - a man who had spent a decade in immigration detention, who justice Debra Mortimer said authorities had taken a ""leisurely"" approach to removing, was whisked away just in time to avoid a challenge that could free hundreds of people.

The commonwealth met its match in NZYQ, a stateless Rohingyan man who had raped a 10-year-old boy, an offence so grave as to make his release or removal to a third country impossible.

So when NZYQ sued the immigration minister, Andrew Giles, this time the government agreed in a special case on 30 May that there was no real likelihood of deporting him.

Still, it kicked into gear at the direction of the home affairs minister, Clare O'Neil, who asked that no stone be left unturned, resulting in a mad dash to ask six countries to take NZYQ.

All said no, except the US, which promised to take a hard look. Obviously, that wasn't enough to convince the court, so NZYQ was freed, with 92 others following because they too could not be deported.

O'Neil told Sky News on Sunday the department thought it was ""likely"" to win the case. It should not have been at all confident.

There was a better indication, too, that the government did not think it was on firm ground: Giles has noted several times the federal and state police joint operation to respond in the event of a loss had been set up in advance of the hearing. That's an unusual redundancy for a side expecting to win.

For much of the past week, Dutton and Tehan have essentially argued where there is a will to detain these people, there must be a way. The court said otherwise.

Perhaps it's precisely because the Australian public was so supportive of locking people up and throwing away the key that the search for better and more constitutionally sound alternatives ceased.

This is a decision we will pay for now.

The solicitor general, Stephen Donaghue, said as much on the second day of hearings, warning the commonwealth would be exposed to ""inevitable"" damages claims for false imprisonment.

These claims would be ""undefendable"" in cases where the government conceded the people had been detained while it was impossible to deport them, he said.

Both sides suspected indefinite detention could fall and they now expect demands for compensation.

The price of the detention regime has been decades of lost liberty, ""hopelessness"", and likely a hefty bill for taxpayers.","{'uri': 'theguardian.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","[{'uri': 'paul_karp@theguardian.com', 'name': 'Paul Karp', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': False}]",https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/22fbe2d8b2f4b673c0674c5f653f4fa230a845ee/0_188_8256_4954/master/8256.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n&s=19636c8a7b7db765755386f0de6621a8,eng-9074360,-0.2156862745098039,25,25,The Guardian,theguardian.com

Rwanda plan 'probably dead' in its current form - ex-Supreme Court judge

The Government's Rwanda plan is 'probably dead' in its current form, former Supreme Court judge Lord Sumption claimed today.

When asked on the Sky News whether the scheme is 'dead', he replied: 'I think the current Rwanda scheme is probably dead, but we obviously have to suspend judgment until we see what this legislation or this new treaty looks like.'

Lord Sumption also suggested judges in Strasbourg would come to a similar view of the scheme's legality as UK Supreme Court justices.

He said: 'The Government have made clear... that they don't intend to do that (withdraw from the European Convention on Human Rights).

'Although the Government may well ignore interim orders from Strasbourg, they presumably intend to comply with final orders from Strasbourg.

'It (the Strasbourg court) will investigate safety for itself and probably arrive at a conclusion very similar to that of the Supreme Court.'

He also said he is 'sceptical' of reported plans to send British civil servants to work in the east African country, adding: 'The main problem (with the) scheme is that it outsources to Rwanda the decision about whether people have refugee status.'

A Tory source told the Sun on Sunday: 'Suella was always clear about what was needed to stop the boats from the minute she came in as home ­secretary.

'That never changed. It was very tense at times - she got more of what she wanted in negotiations, but never enough.

'Rishi and No 10 repeatedly failed to heed her warnings that we could lose in the courts and needed other options as well as a much tougher approach.'

The source added: 'Now we are miles behind in the polls. The buck stops with Sunak.'

In an interview with the Mail On Sunday, Mrs Braverman warned Mr Sunak he was 'running out of time' ahead of the general election to deliver on his promise to stop the boats.

She said: 'I welcome the PM's announcement that he wants to introduce emergency legislation, something for which I've been calling for several months, which he blocked.

'I'm very glad he changed his view in the last few days but this needs to be meaningful change in the law and tweaking and fine-tuning is not going to cut it... and we will not get flights off before the next general election.'

Meanwhile, the Telegraph reported the PM will station more Home Office officials in Rwanda in order to support the east African country's asylum system.

It was claimed the action would be seen as vindication for Mrs Braverman, who pressed for the move while home secretary.

A senior Government source told the newspaper that preparations were underway to 'step up Home Office people who will be doing training and assisting with case working in Rwanda, so that their system is as robust as possible'.

They added that Supreme Court judges, when they ruled on ministers' plans, had not been able to take into account the 'additional work' that has been taking place with Rwanda over the past year to improve the country's processes.

Another senior Government source pointed out the Home Office already had officials in Rwanda in an advisory role, and had done for a long time before the Supreme Court ruling or Mrs Braverman's departure as home secretary.

The Home Office said it would not comment on speculation around future ways of working.

A Government spokesman told the Sun on Sunday: 'As the PM has set out, we were prepared for all outcomes of the Supreme Court case.

'That is why we have been working on a treaty with Rwanda, providing a guarantee in law that those re-located there will be protected against being removed.

'And we'll bring in emergency legislation to end the merry-go-round of litigation in our domestic courts.

The government's plan to deport asylum seekers to Rwanda is ""probably dead"" after it was ruled unlawful this week by the Supreme Court, one of its former justices has said.

The court confirmed its ""unanimous"" decision on Wednesday after 18 months of legal battles, saying those sent to the country would be at ""real risk"" of being returned home, whether their grounds to claim asylum were justified or not - breaching international law.

Politics live: Chancellor 'wants to lower tax burden'

Prime Minister Rishi Sunak has pledged to push on with the scheme - which aims to deter asylum seekers travelling to the country on small boats - promising to turn the agreement with the east African nation into a legally binding treaty to allay the court's fears, and to change the law in the UK to define Rwanda as a ""safe country"".

And Chancellor Jeremy Hunt told Sky News' Sunday Morning with Trevor Phillips it was the government's ""plan"" to bring forward the new treaty and legislation quickly.

But speaking on the same programme, Lord Sumption said such measures ""wouldn't work internationally"", adding it was not a proposal to change the law ""but to change the facts"".

MPs on the right of the Conservative Party have been up in arms since the ruling - including the recently sacked home secretary Suella Braverman, who has demanded the government withdraws from international treaties like the European Human Rights Convention or ignores the obligations to ensure the Rwanda scheme can go ahead.

But Lord Sumption called that option ""extreme"".

Defending the court's ruling, he said: ""They carefully avoided the political broader merits of the Rwanda project. They confined themselves to looking at whether Rwanda was a safe place to send people to. That was the sole issue.

""And what they decided was that it wasn't because Rwanda's record of expelling refugees to places which are or may be unsafe was bad, and because Rwanda just didn't have the cultural, administrative or political substructure which was necessary to perform an agreement of that sort.""

The peer added: ""You can't in a matter of weeks or months or even years simply turn a country like that into one with an impartial civil service, an independent judiciary and the whole administrative culture.

""Ultimately, what the main problem about this scheme is that it outsources to Rwanda the decision about whether people have refugee status or not. And Rwanda just is not up to the job.""

Explainer: What we know about the future of the Rwanda scheme - and what we don't

Lord Sumption said changing the UK law to insist the country is safe may work ""domestically"", but even if the government chose to ignore its obligations to international treaties initially, it would ""presumably intend to comply"" with final orders from the European court.

Asked by Trevor Phillips if the scheme was now ""dead"" as a result of the Supreme Court ruling, the peer said: ""I think the current Rwanda's scheme is probably dead, but we obviously have to suspend judgements until we see what this legislation or this new treaty looks like.

""There are other possibilities. They're not terribly attractive, but they do exist.""

Asked if he was comfortable with a change in the law to ensure the Rwanda scheme could push ahead, Mr Hunt told Trevor Phillips: ""Yes, that is our democratic right as members of parliament, we made that commitment to the British people.""

On small boat crossings, the chancellor said the government was ""making progress, but we haven't yet finished the job"", adding: ""We've been very clear we will do what it takes because a government's job is to secure borders.

New law, to come into force next January, will enable easier enforcement of cross-border court rulings, Hong Kong and mainland-qualified lawyer says

A new law that will allow reciprocal enforcement of court judgments in Hong Kong and mainland China in civil and commercial cases will not damage the interests of businesses based in the city, but will reduce costs involved in re-litigation, legal experts have said.

The city lawyers defended the new system on Sunday after Paul Lam Ting-kwok, the justice secretary, acted to clear up confusion over the change.

Tony Au Siu-hong, a Hong Kong lawyer also qualified to practice in the mainland, dismissed claims that the new arrangement would harm the interests of Hong Kong residents and overseas investors and insisted it would offer better safeguards for cross-border deals.

“For example, if the mainland side breaches a contract and attempts to delay its responsibility, what the Hong Kong side can do now could be limited even though it had won lawsuits in a mainland court,” he said. “The new regime will change the scene when the relevant judgments can be enforced in Hong Kong.

“Vice versa, it will facilitate those who win in Hong Kong courts to have the judgment enforced in the mainland, if the judgment fulfils the requirements in the registration process.”

Au also emphasised that the changes only covered designated mainland courts, not “any local-level courts where their impartiality could be questioned” and that the safeguards were in line with international practices.

The new cross-border law will come into force on January 29 next year, five years after a consultation paper was issued.

It will widen the scope of existing legislation to cover civil and commercial matters for reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments by courts across the border.

The two present legal mechanisms only apply to some monetary judgments and matrimonial or family cases.

Lam acted after rumours circulated that the assets and legal rights of businesses would be unprotected under the new regime.

He wrote a detailed defence on his Facebook page on Saturday to dispel two misconceptions created by what he called false and misleading commentaries”.

The post came three days after the announcement of the start date for the new arrangements and at a time when city authorities have been working to attract new investment and talent to boost the economy amid a muted post-pandemic recovery.

The first misconception Lam tackled was that mainland judgments would not become “automatically applicable in Hong Kong” and that city courts would not directly freeze the assets of a party in line with mainland judgments without a hearing.‘Tell story of Hong Kong’s legal system’: call for city’s lawyers to be ‘envoys’

He added no “sharing of judicial information” would take place between the separate courts.

The new ordinance says a cross-border enforcement could be refused if the relevant party was not given a reasonable opportunity to defend the case, the mainland judgment was obtained by fraud, or the parties had started legal proceedings in Hong Kong before the mainland court took on the case.

Under the Foreign Judgments (Reciprocal Enforcement) Ordinance, judgments from about 15 jurisdictions are enforceable in Hong Kong.

These include court decisions from Australia, Singapore and France.

Common law applies as the legal framework for recognition and enforcement of foreign judgments in the city for other jurisdictions.

Nick Chan Hiu-fung, a lawyer and the chairman of the Hong Kong General Chamber of Commerce’s legal committee, said the rumours were a “misinformation campaign” designed to trick the international business community in Hong Kong.

“Some people who had lost lawsuits in the mainland or elsewhere might choose to launch new lawsuits here in Hong Kong,” he said. “By doing this, they buy time to move assets away from home but this could result in the delay of justice.

“This arrangement could reduce these legal tricks, in turn benefiting the legal system and the economy.”Hong Kong can ‘use unique assets to help further develop international trade laws’

He added that, with increased cross-border trade economic activities, the regime would instead help businesses slash the costs required for re-litigation of cases and achieve justice.

Lam’s post underlined that the legal change would provide sufficient protection, as well as fair balance between the legal interests of parties engaged in cross-border business.

He said the city’s Department of Justice and the Supreme People’s Court in the mainland would organise a seminar on the day when the new arrangement came into force.

Lau Siu-kai, a consultant for Beijing’s semi-official think tank, the Chinese Association of Hong Kong and Macau Studies, said authorities of both sides should act fast to further ease investors’ concerns, especially when Hong Kong, a global financial hub, had set ambitious investment targets.

“Hong Kong’s role as an international legal and dispute resolution hub has been valued by the central government,” Lau said. “The arrangement will allow Hong Kong’s independent judiciary to maintain its reputation while enforcing mainland court judgments.

“But more should be done to prevent misinformation from snowballing into a crisis that would hurt investors’ faith.”

Some lawmakers said when the bill was scrutinised in the Legislative Council in 2017 that they had doubts about the compatibility of the two legal jurisdictions, the independence of the mainland’s judicial system and the effectiveness of the proposed safeguards.

The Hong Kong Bar Association backed the change, but added that the details in some areas, such as level of court for dealing with the registration application and the arrangements for specific areas of law needed further examination.","{'uri': 'scmp.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'South China Morning Post'}",[],https://cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/d8/images/canvas/2023/11/19/0ce2b879-edfe-4d55-b80c-61c6b37ccc73_8cc642ef.jpg?itok=-BV0zGGe,eng-9069710,0.388235294117647,25,25,South China Morning Post,scmp.com

Like the entire country, I was absolutely horrified to discover that the UK's courts and laws were being abused by this appalling individual.

I was disgusted to learn how, at the 11th hour, his deportation was abandoned when plane passengers, unaware of his crime and apparently feeling sorry for him, intervened and insisted he be escorted off the flight due to take him out of the country.

I was absolutely determined to meet Ahmed's victim because I wanted to help give her voice back and support her in getting justice for the abhorrent crime she endured. My meeting with 'Hannah' in 2020 was deeply personal and profoundly moving.

That was why, as Home Secretary, I took such a deep and personal interest in the shocking case of Yaqub Ahmed and the gross injustice that was being endured by his victim

It was clear to me that the immigration and asylum system was working against the interests of a British citizen who was the victim of the most horrendous crime.

Home Office officials often thought it was unusual when I wanted to speak to victims of crime, but for me this was an essential part of my role.

Government should stop its dithering

During our conversation, Hannah openly spoke of the vile crime committed against her, the shattering impact it had, and how incredibly difficult she found it to rebuild her life. What struck me more than anything was her bravery and the extraordinary strength of her resolve.

She was determined to see justice and wanted to work with me to ensure this appalling person was removed from our country.

Among the many egregious elements of this case, Ahmed had the audacity to try to use our modern slavery laws to keep himself in this country. This was one of many insults to this poor woman and, quite frankly, it was one of the many failings in our criminal justice system that this could be allowed to happen. His case also included an outrageous attempt to circumvent our laws by using a fake video to try to dupe the courts.

Like the entire country, I was absolutely horrified to discover that the UK's courts and laws were being abused by this appalling individual

I knew from day one of becoming Home Secretary that the endless appeals and legal merry-go-round in our immigration courts and tribunals was totally unacceptable. But the Ahmed case was a tipping point for me, particularly because of the fabricated video and concocted death threat he used to try to stay in the UK.

It was because of this, and other shocking cases, that I brought in new laws to usher in sweeping changes to the immigration and asylum system.

Some of these changes, however, have still not been implemented.

For example, the Nationality and Borders Act, which our Conservative Government passed, despite relentless opposition from Labour. As part of this Act, Ministers were given the power to remove people more easily from the UK who have no right to be here through a new 'one-stop' process. This would require all asylum, human rights, protection or modern slavery claims to be made up front to stop the absurd circus of legal claims and appeals.

But these important powers have still not been introduced. I urge the Government to pull their fingers out and stop dithering.

I also wanted to encourage the use of so-called wasted cost orders in immigration cases so lawyers who promote spurious immigration cases would have to pick up the court costs.

Frustratingly, that provision - which would stop the extraordinary waste of public money - failed to make it into law because civil servants at the Ministry of Justice were against it.

The British public is understandably fed up with the way our immigration system is abused. We have to ensure that we remove foreign offenders from our country swiftly and that they do not keep hiding behind legal processes. Victims of appalling crimes like Hannah deserve nothing less.

Former President Donald Trump and his legal team have turned New York Attorney General Letitia James' $250 million civil fraud lawsuit into a spectacle, goading Judge Arthur Engoron, politicizing the proceedings, and spectacularly undermining norms of trial behavior.

That pattern continued on Wednesday, when Trump's lawyers filed a motion for a mistrial that claimed Engoron's handling of the trial has been tainted by political bias. (Engoron denied the motion on Friday afternoon.)

Trump's strategy bears a resemblance to tactics employed by the defendants in the notorious ""Chicago Seven"" criminal trial more than 50 years ago, which resulted in the jury convictions being overturned on appeal.

Whether intentional or coincidental, the similarities between these trial strategies are informative -- especially for Engoron.

When legal defense teams push and taunt their presiding judges, they are often hoping to make the judge overreact and make mistakes. If judges do take this bait and make errors, an appellate court could potentially conclude that the trial was unfair and reverse the judgment.

The four-month Chicago trial, which took place between 1969 and 1970, was chaotic and political. Eight defendants were originally charged with violating the Federal Anti-Riot Act, 18 U.S.C. 2101, along with additional crimes in connection with violent encounters between Chicago police and demonstrators protesting the Democratic National Convention in August 1968.

A mistrial was declared for defendant Bobby Seale, whom the judge had ordered bound and gagged in the courtroom for a portion of the trial (he was convicted of multiple charges of contempt of court). Two others were acquitted on all charges, and the remaining five were acquitted on some charges but found guilty of violating the Anti-Riot Act.

The appeals court, in reversing those five Anti-Riot Act convictions, noted that the courtroom was often in an ""uproar,"" and criticized the ""provocative, sometimes insulting, language and activity by several defendants."" But, the court noted, such bad behavior did not excuse errors by the trial judge. ""There are high standards for the conduct of judges and prosecutors, and impropriety by persons before the court does not give license to depart from those standards,"" reads the decision, which notes that the ""district judge's deprecatory and often antagonistic attitude toward the defense is evident in the record from the very beginning.""

In New York, Engoron has used strident language in rejecting Trump's legal positions, terming them ""pure sophistry,"" ""risible,"" ""bogus arguments"" and ""egregious"" in his summary judgment opinion. He sanctioned five Trump attorneys $7,500 each for the ""borderline frivolous"" arguments in their briefs.

Harsh language isn't a problem if it's justified. But the more Engoron pushes the envelope, the more he risks an appellate court disagreeing with his assessment. And Trump's lawyers can and will argue the judge's rhetoric is evidence of judicial bias.

And Engoron has already been reversed by the New York appellate court, which ruled that the judge should have dismissed Ivanka Trump as a defendant due to the statute of limitations.

Engoron's interactions with his law clerk, and the drama that has surrounded them, are another area of concern. Trump has repeatedly criticized the clerk, making false statements about her that the court found had precipitated threats of violence. When Trump twice violated a gag order prohibiting such remarks, he was fined $15,000.

The presence of law clerks at all levels of the federal and state judiciaries is ubiquitous. Justices of the U.S. Supreme Court, for example, have four law clerks each. Engoron having a law clerk to assist him is commonplace. Less common is a law clerk who sits next to the judge, repeatedly exchanging notes.

When challenged that the clerk was acting as co-judge and creating an appearance of bias, Engoron was defiant: ""I am 1,000% convinced that you don't have any right or reason to complain about my confidential communications,"" Engoron said.

Courts have ruled that the communications between a law clerk and a judge are immune from disclosure. But ironically that secrecy could bolster Trump's argument on appeal, since the content of the notes cannot be examined to determine if the messages were proper.

Engoron's issuance of gag orders barring Trump and his lawyers from commenting about his law clerk both publicly and in court sessions is also facing scrutiny by a higher court. On Thursday, a New York appellate judge temporarily halted Engoron's gag orders, citing First Amendment protections. An appellate court panel is scheduled to evaluate the issue on Nov. 27.

So here again we have Engoron committing a potentially unnecessary unforced error. Instead of trying to mitigate risk, he is clearly allowing emotion to color his responses.

And there are other examples of Engoron seemingly overreacting in response to relentless complaining from Trump's lawyers.

Obviously, Trump's civil trial is very different from the Chicago Seven trial, a criminal proceeding with a jury, in multiple important ways. And the appeals court cited multiple reasons to reverse the Chicago convictions.

But Engoron would be wise to consider the lessons of that case nonetheless. He needs to take all necessary steps to ensure that a New York appellate court cannot overturn his decision. And that means not reacting to Trump's hate-filled speech, or to his lawyers' baiting and provocation. It's simply not worth it.","{'uri': 'msnbc.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'MSNBC.com'}",[],"https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_nbcnews-fp-1024-512,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2023-11/231118-engoron-trump-mjf-1530-5f7504.jpg",eng-9072064,-0.4588235294117647,25,25,MSNBC.com,msnbc.com

A coalition of organisations championing press freedom have rallied behind the award-winning Observer and Guardian journalist Carole Cadwalladr, stating they are ""deeply disappointed"" she has been refused permission to appeal against a ruling that ordered her to pay significant legal costs to the prominent Brexit backer Arron Banks.

The supreme court refused to let Cadwalladr contest a cost order six months ago making the journalist responsible for hundreds of thousands of pounds of Banks's legal costs. The coalition, which includes Index on Censorship, the Guardian, the Observer and Reporters Without Borders UK among others, warns that the decision risks stifling public interest journalism in the UK.

Cadwalladr's legal team confirmed on Saturday, however, that the fight was not over, revealing that they would be taking the case to Strasbourg.

Gavin Millar KC said: ""Carole established that over 90% of the publications Banks sued on were lawful public interest speech. So her lawyers believe the order for her to pay 60% of Banks' costs was a penalty which violated her right to journalistic freedom of expression under article 10 [of the European Convention on Human Rights]. We will seek a ruling to this effect from the European Court of Human Rights.""

Millar's intervention arrived as the UK Anti-Slapp Coalition - campaigning against what it calls ""abusive lawsuits filed by a private party with the purpose of silencing critical speech"" - issued a statement of support for Cadwalladr.

""It is important to reassert that Banks was only successful on less than 10% of the publications he sued on. Yet the application of the UK costs rules for libel means that Carole is now expected to pay a six-figure sum. We cannot have a level playing field when lodging a defence or fighting a case through different courts can threaten your livelihood or render you bankrupt,"" the coalition said.

The supreme court recently ordered that ""permission to appeal be refused because the proposed appeal does not raise an arguable point of law"". It added that the supreme court could not interfere with the court of appeal's discretion to award costs, unless the court ""erred in principle or exercised its discretion in an unreasonable manner, and neither of those conditions is met"".

Banks, who donated a record £8m to the pro-Brexit Leave.EU campaign group, sued over comments made by Cadwalladr in a Ted talk and a tweet in 2019. He originally lost his case.

Mrs Justice Steyn found Cadwalladr's remarks were protected when she made them because they were part of reporting on a matter of ""real and abiding public interest"", and her belief that publishing those remarks was in the public interest was a reasonable one for her to hold.

The judge also ruled that the public interest defence fell away from April 2020, when the Electoral Commission issued a statement confirming it accepted an earlier National Crime Agency conclusion that there was no evidence that Banks had broken the law. But she found Banks had not suffered serious harm as a result of the continuing publication. Steyn added that it was ""neither fair nor apt to describe this as a Slapp suit"".

Banks then went to the court of appeal, which partially ruled in his favour, concluding serious harm had been caused by the continuing publication of the words complained of in the Ted talk after April 2020. It did not overturn the public interest defence of the original reporting, which the appeal court recognised ""absorbed most of the time and money"". The parties later agreed that Cadwalladr should pay £35,000 in damages for the continued publication.

However, the costs ruling required Cadwalladr to cover 60% of Banks's legal bills for the original case, repay some money he had been ordered to pay her in respects of her costs for the original hearing, and pay one-third of his legal costs for the appeal, a sum amounting to hundreds of thousands of pounds.

Following that ruling, Banks said: ""In my opinion, this case is being driven by Cadwalladr's lawyers, who banked the win.""","{'uri': 'theguardian.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","[{'uri': 'mark_townsend@theguardian.com', 'name': 'Mark Townsend', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': False}]",https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/48add598b547e4f61031c8cfd152970d3bb5df39/0_593_3712_2226/master/3712.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdG8tZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&s=76d40b2fb7d76c852d1b41d2bba1f2ef,,0.1686274509803922,25,25,The Guardian,theguardian.com

The Home Office's approach to tackling county lines drug operations is based on unproven assumptions and ""racialised tropes"" that criminalise Black boys and young men, according to new research.

The study also found that the policing strategy towards county lines stigmatised Black youngsters in a similar way to how the Metropolitan police's discredited gang violence matrix database was found to be discriminatory.

The findings, published by thinktank the Institute of Race Relations (IRR), says the government's claim that county lines is the ""most violent and exploitative"" drugs distribution model, requiring a multi-agency approach, is unproven. ""There is a dearth of evidence to support the contention of an increase in the use and supply of [Class A] drugs as a result of 'county lines',"" said the IRR study.

Niamh Eastwood, executive director of drugs charity Release, said the study highlighted growing concerns about the strategy: ""The county lines narrative has been used by government and police as a contrived new threat that falsely and cruelly legitimises the targeting of racialised communities, especially of young Black children and men.""

The IRR tried to identify the ethnicity of people considered ""at risk"" of involvement in county lines by the Met, but said its freedom of information request had not been answered. However, available data indicates that, by 2020, of 3,290 people ""having a link or suspected link"" to county lines in London, 83% belonged to an ethnic minority.

The research, published this week in the journal Race & Class, adds that young Black people are up to six times more likely than any other ethnicity to be included in county lines safeguarding classifications. A national child safeguarding review panel also identified a concerning ""over-representation"" of Black boys in those considered at risk from county lines.

The IRR's director, Liz Fekete, said the research should serve as a ""wake-up call"" to councils and safeguarding officials about the perils of being drawn into racial profiling. She urged them to urgently review procedures and databases. ""We need to ensure that they are not complicit in a new form of criminalisation of Black and minority ethnic children, particularly those excluded from school, and/or in care,"" she said.

Lauren Wroe, one of the study's authors, said: ""While we don't see enough action from government on child poverty - itself partly the result of austerity politics - we have witnessed rampant campaigns against so-called grooming gangs, child traffickers and now county lines gangs.""

Wroe, assistant professor in the sociology department at Durham University, added: ""The government throws these issues into the spotlight in an attempt to ramp up support for policies that are tough on crime and tough on immigration, while it fails to address the entrenched inequalities it has created over the last decade.""

The Home Office began outlining attempts to tackle county lines in 2017, and a detailed programme unveiled four years ago has led to more than 14,800 arrests and another 7,200 individuals being referred by police to safeguarding initiatives.

Government officials use county lines as a term to describe ""gangs and organised criminal networks involved in exporting illegal drugs into one or more importing areas within the UK"".

However, the IRR report says the drugs model entered the policy agenda as a culmination of local ""problem profiling"" carried out under the now defunct Ending Gangs and Youth Violence (EGYV) programme and other former anti-gangs policies.

They warn its county lines strategy risks repeating some of the failings of the Met's matrix database, which is being overhauled after the force admitted its operation was unlawful.

The report, by three leading experts in criminal justice and social policy, says that questions need to be asked over the adoption of the relatively ""new crime label"" of county lines, the multi-agency policing of the issue and subsequent prosecution of young men under the Modern Slavery Act.

""At the extreme end, this can culminate in a new racialised trope of young black men as 'the new slave masters of today',"" states their report.

It also found that safeguarding procedures are not protecting young people in a way they were meant to. ""Safeguarding professionals often deploy arbitrary distinctions between victim and offender, gang member and associate,"" the report says.

Angélique Vassell, founder of WalkwithMeUK, a London-based group working with families of colour whose children have been exploited, said: ""The overarching heartache for many families that we support is that they want to be protected as opposed to being neglected and criminalised.""

Eastwood said: ""This groundbreaking and excellent research adds to the evidence that the drug war is a racist endeavour that harms communities and fails to protect society as a whole.""

The National Police Chiefs' Council lead for county lines, Commander Paul Brogden, told the Observer: ""County lines drug dealing destroys lives and we are committed to tackling the supply of illegal drugs, and the exploitation and violence that is frequently associated with it.

""County Lines remains a top priority for policing, and drug gangs across the UK were targeted recently in our latest national police operation, the county lines intensification week.

""The figures from this intensification week demonstrate our work to protect communities from harm, with 710 individuals safeguarded, including 58 children.

""We work closely with key partners, such as Catch22 and Rescue and Response, to help protect young people from county lines across our taskforce model.

""In the last 18 months, one such taskforce team, working at the Metropolitan police, has rescued 52 children from county lines, 63% of whom were Black children.""

Attorney General John Formella identified the suspect in Friday's shooting as 33-year-old John Madore. Formella said Madore was homeless and had recently spent time at a hotel on the Seacoast and then in Concord.

After the shooting, a U-Haul truck was found idling in the hospital's parking lot. New Hampshire State Police Col. Mark Hall said the bomb squad inspected the truck and determined it wasn't a public safety threat. Inside the truck, an AR-style rifle, tactical vest and several rounds of ammunition were found. Formella didn't confirm if it was connected to Madore.

The security officer killed in the shooting was identified as 63-year-old Bradley Haas, a veteran of the Franklin Police Department and the department's former chief. After Haas was shot, Hall said a state trooper assigned to the hospital responded immediately shot and killed Madore. The trooper's identity won't be released until an investigation is completed. Formella said several other people were in the lobby at the time but didn't say if they were patients, staff or visitors.

""Chief Haas dedicated 26 years to the city and department, culminating in his tenure as chief. He retired in 2008. He continued to dedicate his time to the NH community by service as a security officer and protecting those at the NH State Hospital,"" the Franklin Police Department said in a statement on Facebook.

Autopsies are being done on Madore and Haas Saturday.

""Make no mistake, if not for the heroics and sacrifice of Bradley Haas, the bravery of the New Hampshire Hospital staff, the unflinching response of New Hampshire State Police, this tragedy could have been much, much worse,"" said Gov.

After more than a month on the run, a murder suspect who was among four escapees from a Macon, Georgia jail has been recaptured following a multi-week manhunt.

Fournier had been on the run since October 16 when he escaped from Bibb County Jail along with three other men, Marc Kerry Anderson, Johnifer Dernard Barnwell, and Chavis Demaryo Stokes.

The UK's highest court ruled against Rishi Sunak's plans to deport all illegal migrants to Rwanda, saying it breached at least five UK laws and four international conventions.

This led to Mr Sunak becoming 'furious', despite the news inflation had halved.

'For 46 minutes, government good news led BBC News,' one official told The Times.

'Then the ruling came - joy turned to despair. Confusion and chaos reigned.

'Number 10 were firing in loads of questions to the Home Office, asking random questions on figures such as arrests and deportations.

'They were just trying to get through the day.'

But Mr Sunak announced the government will introduce emergency legislation to get flights to Rwanda off the ground.

In a press conference on Wednesday evening, he said this new legislation will enable parliament to 'confirm' that 'Rwanda is safe' and end a 'merry-go-round' of legal challenges.

He added the government is working on a new international treaty with Rwanda, which will 'provide a guarantee in law that those who are relocated from the UK to Rwanda will be protected against removal from Rwanda and it will make clear that we will bring back anyone if ordered to do so by a court'.

It followed Mr Sunak sacking Suella Braverman as home secretary and the subsequent cabinet reshuffle, which included the surprise appointment of David Cameron as foreign secretary.

New home secretary James Cleverly confirmed the government still plans to run deportation flights to Rwanda in the future, after the Supreme Court ruled they currently cannot go ahead.

The controversial scheme forms a cornerstone of Rishi Sunak's flagship promise to 'stop the boats', with ministers arguing the prospect of deportation would act as a deterrent to drive down the number of people crossing the English Channel.","{'uri': 'metro.co.uk', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'Metro'}","[{'uri': 'brooke_davies@metro.co.uk', 'name': 'Brooke Davies', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': False}]",https://metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/SEI_180311942-9bd9.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&crop=0px%2C176px%2C2500px%2C1313px&resize=1200%2C630,eng-9063836,-0.04313725490196074,25,25,Metro,metro.co.uk

SUELLA Braverman sent Rishi Sunak six letters during her year as Home Secretary warning his Rwanda plan risked being a failure.

But the PM ""failed to heed"" her warnings, The Sun on Sunday has been told.

The bombshell claims pile yet more pressure on Mr Sunak, who is facing the biggest crisis of his time in No 10.

Furious Conservative MPs are in open revolt after he sacked her and lost the Supreme Court Rwanda ruling in a turbulent 48 hours.

A Tory source said: ""Suella was always clear about what was needed to stop the boats from the minute she came in as Home ­Secretary. That never changed.

""It was very tense at times -- she got more of what she wanted in negotiations, but never enough.

""Rishi and No 10 repeatedly failed to heed her warnings that we could lose in the courts and needed other options as well as a much tougher approach.""

The source added: ""Now we are miles behind in the polls. The buck stops with Sunak.""

And, in a blistering interview with the Mail on Sunday, she also accused the PM of lacking ""moral leadership"" by not coming down hard enough over the recent pro-Palestine marches.

Ms Braverman said: ""We've seen hundreds of thousands of people take to the streets on a weekly basis chanting anti-Semitic slogans, celebrating acts of terrorism, threatening community cohesion and undermining British values.

""There had been tepid and timid statements from the Prime Minister throughout the course of this issue and I felt there was a real opportunity for him to demonstrate some moral leadership, to demonstrate this is not what Britain stands for, that we are an inclusive, tolerant and respectful nation whereby violence on the streets is unacceptable.

""I felt that was wholly lacking.""

She said the police had ""let down the British people, let down the Jewish community"".

She added: ""What we've seen on the streets of Britain really reflects a very high risk of radicalisation, extremism and anti-Semitism.""

Ms Braverman said Mr Sunak must ""change course urgently"" to avoid electoral oblivion.

Her explosive comments come after a hellish week for Mr Sunak, whose party is once again descending into civil war.

After months of bitter rows, the PM brutally sacked Ms Braverman in a short phone call on Monday.

But the move deeply divided his party.

Some Conservatives privately hailed her departure, but others on the Right were spitting feathers.

Two days later, the PM suffered his biggest blow since moving into No 10 when the Supreme Court ruled against his flagship Rwanda deportation scheme.

Furious Mr Sunak slammed the verdict and vowed to do whatever it takes to get deportation flights off the ground.

He is bringing forward his Plan B ""within days"".

This includes a new legal treaty with Rwanda and emergency legislation declaring the country safe.

But Ms Braverman has warned this will flop unless Mr Sunak finally takes her advice and opts Britain out of human rights laws.

She has accused him of ""magical thinking"" and warned ""tinkering"" will not stop the boats.

Last night, No 10 hit back at claims Ms Braverman privately agitated for a tougher course of action.

A government spokesman said: ""As the Prime Minister has set out, we were prepared for all outcomes of the Supreme Court case.

""That is why we have been working on a treaty with Rwanda, providing a guarantee in law that those relocated there will be protected against being removed.

""And we'll bring in emergency legislation to end the merry-go-round of litigation in our domestic courts.

""We are fully focused on making our Rwanda plan operational as swiftly as possible, delivering on our commitment to stop the boats.""

The Tory Party has been plunged into a fresh bout of infighting over what the Government's response to the Supreme Court should be.

Some have suggested the Conservatives are hurtling towards a fresh Brexit-style split over whether or not to quit the ECHR.

Sir Jacob Rees-Mogg, writing in today's Sun on Sunday, said: ""The frustration with this Government is not that it is bad or incompetent, but that it is always just too late.""

The Rwandan government has slammed the Supreme Court ruling.

Writing in today's Sun on ­Sunday, spokeswoman Yolande Makolo said: ""The Supreme Court's highly political judgment on the Migration and Economic Development Partnership was insulting to my country.""

Right-wing Tory MPs want Mr Sunak to adopt Ms Braverman's approach and toughen the law so we opt out of human rights laws for borders policy.

Some inside the Government have dismissed it as ""legal voodoo"" that will not work.

But this risks sparking a row within the Conservative Party as many Tory MPs loathe the idea of quitting our international human rights obligations.

Either way, No 10 and the Tory Party are braced for a giant dust- up with the House of Lords over the Rwanda Plan B.

Former Cabinet minister Sir Simon Clarke wants the Government to call a snap election if the Lords block it.","{'uri': 'thesun.co.uk', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'The Sun'}","[{'uri': 'kate_ferguson@thesun.co.uk', 'name': 'Kate Ferguson', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': False}]",https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/newspress-collage-24782275-1700337370352.jpg?1700337384&strip=all&quality=100&w=1920&h=1080&crop=1,eng-9063836,-0.3725490196078431,25,25,The Sun,thesun.co.uk

The final verdict is in: the supreme court last week upheld the court of appeal's judgment that deporting asylum seekers to Rwanda is unlawful , because it would be unsafe for them. It means that Rishi Sunak must return to the drawing board his flagship policy aimed at reducing the number of people trying to get to the UK to seek refuge by detaining those who do and sending a small fraction to Rwanda for their claims to be assessed and granted there. But, while the supreme court judgment underlines the immorality of the UK seeking to shirk its international responsibilities on refugee protection, even had the courts ruled the policy lawful, it would not have had the deterrent effect the prime minister has promised voters.

In June, the court of appeal assessed the evidence and ruled that deporting asylum seekers to Rwanda was unlawful due to the risk that people with valid asylum claims who were sent to Rwanda would be returned to their home countries, where they would face persecution or inhumane treatment. The supreme court also looked at a breadth of evidence and unanimously concluded that the court of appeal was right to reach this judgment. It cited evidence for Rwanda's poor human rights record, including extrajudicial killings, enforced disappearances and torture; serious defects in Rwanda's asylum processes, including an untested right to appeal; its surprisingly high rejection rates for countries in known conflict zones; and its failures to honour an agreement with Israel, which tried a similar scheme, not to deport asylum seekers with valid claims to their home countries. The judges made clear that this evidence would have put the UK not just in breach of the European convention on human rights but of many other international treaties ratified by the UK as well as several domestic statutes.

Extraordinarily, the Conservatives' deputy chairman, Lee Anderson, reacted by saying that the government should break the law and deport people to Rwanda anyway. Ministers have unsurprisingly distanced themselves from this call worthy of a dictator. Instead, the prime minister has announced his intention to sign a binding treaty with Rwanda in place of the existing memorandum, and pass domestic legislation that would guarantee any further legal challenge would fail.

This will not work on several levels. Signing a binding treaty with Rwanda around how it processes asylum claims - even if it promises not to deport those who are not granted asylum, as hinted at by a Rwandan government official last week - will not in itself overturn the evidence that the system is unsafe and that Rwanda has a track record of not honouring agreements in this area with third countries. It is also not clear how primary legislation could prevent a further challenge to a reformulated scheme in the UK courts, and or even how the government could get this legislation through the House of Lords in the next year. The chances of the government being able to begin deportations to Rwanda before a general election are minuscule.

But perhaps that is Sunak's intention. He will know as well as anyone how unlikely he is to achieve this. He will also know how unlikely his policy is to have the deterrent effect that he claims: there is strong evidence that deporting a fraction of asylum seekers who come to the UK to Rwanda will have little impact, as even the Home Office's own internal analysis concludes. Instead, through its Illegal Migration Act the government has created a need to detain what will probably be hundreds of thousands of people - most of whom would be granted refugee status - arriving in the UK through irregular means, with nowhere to send them. It is not only grossly inhumane, it is completely impracticable.

Which leaves the impression that the prime minister's true intent is not to stop the small boats but to pick a fight with judges in the desperate hope that voters will then blame others for the government's failures on asylum policy. A populist strategy, with echoes of Brexit: blame someone else for a country's malaise, proffer a solution you claim is the answer to everything but is no such thing, and convince voters that you are the only person who can deliver it. But the Conservatives' dire poll ratings should serve as a warning that this strategy never works in the medium term.

In the meantime, the real problems in the refugee system will continue to get worse. That is not numbers: the UK is home to a tiny fraction of the world's refugees; we host just 230,000 refugees compared with 2.1 million in Germany and 3.6 million in Turkey. The biggest issue is the huge backlog in processing claims, which has got much worse in recent years, trapping refugees in abject poverty while they are waiting, and racking up unnecessary costs for the taxpayer.

If Sunak's true motivation were to reduce the number of people losing their lives on the dangerous Channel crossing, he would try to negotiate a returns agreement with France, whereby the UK takes the same number of asylum seekers it returns to France but prioritises those who have family in the UK. Instead, he is pursuing a political strategy that is unlikely to win him votes and will achieve nothing apart from polarising the public conversation about refugees. It will be a sorry legacy indeed.","{'uri': 'theguardian.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'The Guardian'}",[],https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2d4f08f189bbec5b2fed5955bc5e70f820daf1ed/873_96_1245_747/master/1245.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdG8tZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&s=af479ad9b36d110d2baa75b684a0a5a4,eng-9063836,0.2078431372549019,25,25,The Guardian,theguardian.com

A body believed to be Chloe Darnel was discovered and sent to the medical examiner's office in Frankfort for an autopsy and positive identification, according to a Friday statement from the Whitley County Sheriff Department's Facebook page.

In addition to murder, Brittany Slaughter, 24, and Adam Hayes, 34, both of Williamsburg, Kentucky, are charged with abuse of a corpse and tampering with physical evidence, according to the sheriff's department. Slaughter had custody of Chloe, the sheriff's department said.

Chloe ""was a bright happy child"" who was met with an ""unhappy ending,"" according to the GoFundMe account which was organized by a family member. Slaughter is Chloe's aunt, according to fundraiser.

Relatives and friends of the child became suspicious because they were unable to see or talk to the girl for the past month, the GoFundMe said. Chloe had seven siblings, according to the fundraiser.

In other updates on the investigation, the sheriff's department said on Wednesday they were looking for a red Mitsubishi Lancer that Slaughter was reportedly driving prior to her and Chloe's disappearance. The two were reported missing, according to the sheriff's department, which added: ""Initial reports indicate Chloe has not been seen since late September of this year.""

The suspect in a callous hospital shooting that saw a security guard gunned down in cold blood has been named - as police reveal chilling items were left behind.

John Madore, 33, has been formally identified as the gunman who was responsible for the shooting of multiple victims which led to one person's death at a New Hampshire hospital on Friday, in the US. Madore was killed in a firefight with law enforcement on Friday evening.

New Hampshire Attorney General John Formella confirmed on Saturday morning that Madore was responsible for the attack. He explained that Madore was homeless and spent time in hotels in Seacost and Concord.

Britain opened its doors to Hong Kong residents in 2021 and more than 160,000 have taken the opportunity to move there under a new visa scheme for British National (Overseas) passport holders.

But the United Kingdom does not welcome all arrivals to its shores. Asylum seekers, claiming they face persecution in their home countries, have faced increasingly tough barriers to entry.

Many have, since 2018, risked their lives by crossing the English Channel in tiny dinghies and boats provided by trafficking gangs. More than 45,000 arrived in 2022 – a record – and a further 27,000 this year.

The trend has become a hot political issue for Prime Minister Rishi Sunak ahead of an election expected next year, with immigration a key concern among supporters of his Conservative Party.

Sunak has vowed to “stop the boats”. But they keep coming. The government hatched an extraordinary plan to solve the problem – send the asylum seekers to Rwanda. But last week, the Supreme Court ruled the scheme unlawful, causing shock and fury in Westminster.Sunak fights to save Rwanda migrants treaty; new plan to be ready in ‘days’

The plan was to fly asylum seekers from Britain to the African country, which would process their claims instead. In return, Britain paid Rwanda an initial £140 million (HK$1.35 billion).

But the UK has an obligation, under international and domestic law, to ensure asylum seekers are not, directly or indirectly, returned to a country where they face persecution.

The Supreme Court found the evidence provided “substantial grounds” for believing migrants sent to Rwanda would face a real risk of such treatment.

Rwanda had agreed to the deal in good faith and given assurances it would comply with international law. But the court highlighted inadequacies in the country’s asylum system, its human rights record, history of sending applicants to other states and failure to honour assurances given in a similar arrangement with Israel. The judges said “intentions and aspirations do not necessarily correspond to reality”, questioning the ability of Rwanda to ensure its promises are met.

This should spell the end for a policy which has, justifiably, been described as cruel, immoral and unworkable. The government insists Rwanda is a “safe third country” for asylum seekers. But in 2021, Britain criticised Rwanda before the United Nations Human Rights Council for “extrajudicial killings, deaths in custody, enforced disappearances and torture”.

Sunak, however, does not appear to have an alternative. He intends to sign a treaty with Rwanda to address the court’s concerns by providing additional reassurance on the treatment of the migrants.

The prime minister even plans to introduce emergency legislation to declare Rwanda safe. As Lord Jonathan Sumption, a part-time judge on Hong Kong’s Court of Final Appeal, told The Times, this amounts to an attempt to “change the facts” from those established by the court. Sunak has even suggested the UK would pull out of the European Convention on Human Rights.

These outrageous attempts to circumvent the courts are not likely to succeed and will undermine Britain’s reputation for adherence to the rule of law. Instead, the government should be looking to provide safe, legal channels for asylum seekers to make their claims and to cut the time taken for processing them.

The treatment of refugees is a global problem. The UN refugee agency reported in 2021 there were 1.4 million in need of resettlement. There are not enough countries willing to take them.

Hong Kong does not grant asylum, but will not return refugees to places where they will be tortured or persecuted. Little more than 1 per cent of applicants succeed with their bids. Those that do can spend many years waiting to be resettled in another country.

The challenge is to establish a system which is both fair and efficient. But the priority, whether in Britain, Hong Kong or elsewhere, must be to ensure the safety of those fleeing persecution and to allow them to start a new life.

As one successful applicant in Hong Kong told the Post: “No one wants to be a refugee.”","{'uri': 'scmp.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'South China Morning Post'}",[],https://cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/og_image_scmp_opinion/public/d8/images/canvas/2023/11/18/88a34ec1-c92b-4d52-ab0b-b19a53182375_8985d721.jpg?itok=2xitjCAb&v=1700315496,eng-9063836,0.04313725490196085,25,25,South China Morning Post,scmp.com

The bus has been missed and there is not another one in sight. This is where we are with the Rwanda policy.

There were things that could have been done and which the Government was advised to do but they have not been done and now the obstacles have grown and an election looms.

Amendments were proposed to this year's Borders bill which would have prevented the Supreme Court from blocking the Rwanda scheme.

In the United Kingdom the highest form of law is that passed by Parliament.

The Courts may interpret it or even declare it incompatible with the European Convention on Human Rights but they cannot override it.

Ultimately, power is with you the voter via your representative in the House of Commons whom you may fire if you are dissatisfied with his performance.

Yet the Government did not make these amendments, it took the risk that it would win in Court and the question is why?

It could be hubris, perhaps the Prime Minister and his legal advisers were confident that he would win or perhaps it was squeamishness.

Those demanding firm action were supporters of Boris and the Government did not want to upset the international elite, the Davos types who prefer international symposiums to domestic democracy.

Either way it has not worked and now time is against the Government which does not seem too have been prepared.

Where is the emergency legislation? Why was a new Bill not put to Parliament on Thursday?

How does the Government propose to get such a Bill through the House of Lords when there is insufficient time to use the Parliament Act?

This lack of foresight makes it highly unlikely that the Rwanda scheme will be operational before the next election but Rishi Sunak must try, his majority depends upon it.

Thus emergency legislation needs to be introduced promptly which gives explicit authority for deportations to Rwanda, it must amend any other laws which are seen as obstacles to this, including the Human Rights Act.

It will probably get stuck in the Lords or the Courts and then it will become a centrepiece of the Election Campaign.

In the meantime legal migration, which is about 15 times the level of the small boats, can be reduced with no Parliamentary or legal fuss and it is, in truth, a bigger issue with greater societal and economic effect.","{'uri': 'thesun.co.uk', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'The Sun'}",[],https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/manchester-jacob-rees-mogg-speaking-849539821-1.jpg?strip=all&quality=100&w=1920&h=1080&crop=1,eng-9063836,-0.02745098039215688,25,25,The Sun,thesun.co.uk

Authorities say the gunman who was killed after shooting to death a security guard at a New Hampshire psychiatric hospital has been identified.

New Hampshire's attorney general, John Formella, said on Saturday that 33-year-old John Madore entered the New Hampshire hospital on Friday afternoon and killed Bradley Haas, a state department of safety security officer who was working at the front lobby entrance of the facility.

All patients at the psychiatric hospital were safe, and the state trooper who killed Madore was not wounded.

Formella said Madore was most recently living in a hotel in the Seacoast region and also had lived in Concord. Investigators are still looking into whether Madore had ties to the hospital or Haas.

The shooting happened around 3.30pm at the New Hampshire hospital and was contained to the front lobby of the 185-bed facility, state police Col Mark Hall said at a news conference. He said CPR was performed on the victim, who later died at Concord hospital.

All patients at the psychiatric hospital were safe, and the state trooper who killed the shooter was not wounded, according to authorities.

""Investigators with the New Hampshire State Police have searched and cleared a suspicious box truck near the scene. They determined the truck poses no safety risk,"" the statement from the attorney general's office said.

Haas lived in Franklin, a small city about 20 miles (32km) from Concord. He worked as a police officer for 28 years and rose to become police chief, according to a statement from the state attorney general's office.

The Franklin police department mourned the death of the former chief, saying he dedicated decades to the city and the police department before retiring in 2008.

""He continued to dedicate his time to the NH community by serving as a security officer helping and protecting those at the NH State Hospital,"" the police department said on its Facebook page. ""The FPD will honor his memory by flying our flags at half staff and wearing mourning bands in our badges.""

No further information was released about the shooter, a possible motive or other details of the attack, but authorities planned to provide an update on the investigation on Saturday morning.

Friday's shooting was the latest act of violence at a US hospital. Medical centers nationwide have struggled to adapt to the growing threats, which have helped make healthcare one of the nation's most violent fields.

It came weeks after 18 people were killed and 13 others injured in a mass shooting in neighboring Maine.

The hospital remained in operation but was closed to visitors on Friday evening.

The facility is the only state-run psychiatric hospital for adults in New Hampshire. Located in the capital city, it is part of a large state office park that includes multiple state agencies and is near the city's high school and district courthouse. The state's department of safety provides security for the hospital.

Democratic representative from New Hampshire Annie Kuster called the shooting ""horrifying.""

""Thank you to the State Police Officers who responded to the scene so quickly,"" Kuster said in a statement. ""My thoughts are with the victim, their family, and the Concord community.""

Dr Adriana Copeland, 62, is suing guitarist Summers, 80, claiming he is trying to avoid paying recording royalties in breach of a 1983 management agreement. A High Court claim says three companies set up by the band in 1979 agreed to pay her management company, Firstars Ltd, 25% of earnings, including royalties, in perpetuity.

The model and sculptor turned psychologist, wed to the band's ex-manager Miles Copeland, says she became Summers' exclusive personal manager, as well as the sole manager to lead singer and bassist Sting and drummer Stewart.

The Police in 1980

The band had huge hits with songs including Every Breath You Take, Roxanne and Message In A Bottle. But Dr Copeland says the companies stopped paying commission on royalties to her from digital performances of Police recordings from January 1, 2014.

Sting and Copeland have since paid their share but Summers has not, she claims. She says the figure owed now stands at £150,000. Lancashire-born Summers joined The Police in 1977. After the band split, he continued recording, touring and composing music for films. In March 2017 he formed Call The Police, a Police tribute band.

He now lives in Santa Monica, ­California, with his second wife Kate. They have three children. The claim, filed by Nicholas Berry of solicitors Gunnercooke, was to be heard at London's High Court but has been moves to Central London County Court.

U.S. District Judge Miranda Du granted the government's motion to dismiss their assertions that the mine is being built illegally near the sacred site of an 1865 massacre along the Nevada-Oregon line.

But she said in an order this month that the three tribes suing the Bureau of Land Management deserve another chance to amend their complaint to try to prove the agency failed to adequately consult with them as required by the National Historic Preservation Act.

""Given that the court has now twice agreed with federal defendants [and] plaintiffs did not vary their argument ... the court is skeptical that plaintiffs could successfully amend it. But skeptical does not mean futile,"" Du wrote Nov. 9.

She also noted part of their case is still pending on appeal at the 9th U.S Circuit Court of Appeals, which indicated last month it likely will hear oral arguments in February as construction continues at Lithium Nevada's mine at Thacker Pass about 230 miles northeast of Reno.

Du said in an earlier ruling the tribes had failed to prove the project site is where more than two dozen of their ancestors were killed by the U.S. Cavalry Sept. 12, 1865.

Her new ruling is the latest in a series that have turned back legal challenges to the mine on a variety of fronts, including environmentalists' assertions it would violate the 1872 Mining Law and destroy key habitat for sage grouse, cutthroat trout and pronghorn antelope.

All have argued the bureau violated numerous laws in a rush to approve the mine to help meet sky-rocketing demand for lithium used in the manufacture of batteries for electric vehicles.

Lithium Nevada officials said the $2.3-billion project remains on schedule to begin production in late 2026. They say it's essential to carrying out President Biden's clean energy agenda aimed at combating climate change by reducing dependence on fossil fuels.

""We've dedicated more than a decade to community engagement and hard work in order to get this project right, and the courts have again validated the efforts by Lithium Americas and the administrative agencies,"" company spokesman Tim Crowley said in an email to the Associated Press.

Du agreed with the government's argument that the consultation is ongoing and, therefore, not ripe for legal challenge.

The tribes argued it had to be completed before construction began.

""If agencies are left to define when consultation is ongoing and when consultation is finished ... then agencies will hold consultation open forever -- even as construction destroys the very objects of consultation -- so that agencies can never be sued,"" the tribal lawyers wrote in recent briefs filed with the 9th Circuit.

Will Falk, representing the Reno-Sparks Indian Colony and Summit Lake Paiute Tribe, said they're still considering whether to amend the complaint by the Dec. 9 deadline Du set, or focus on the appeal.

""Despite this project being billed as 'green,' it perpetrates the same harm to Native peoples that mines always have,"" Falk told AP. ""While climate change is a very real, existential threat, if government agencies are allowed to rush through permitting processes to fast-track destructing mining projects like the one at Thacker Pass, more of the natural world and more Native American culture will be destroyed.""

The Paiutes call Thacker Pass ""Pee hee mu'huh,"" which means ""rotten moon."" They describe in oral histories how Paiute hunters returned home in 1865 to find the ""elders, women, and children"" slain and ""unburied and rotting.""

The Oregon-based Burns Paiute Tribe joined the Nevada tribes in the appeal. They say BLM's consultation efforts with the tribes ""were rife with withheld information, misrepresentations, and downright lies.""","{'uri': 'latimes.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'Los Angeles Times'}",[],https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/3090117/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5400x3038+0+281/resize/1200x675!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F0c%2Fee%2Fc010e324107f867ae2bf46e18fe4%2Ffcecd47af75b449c9d34338c5d1fba9d,eng-9069138,-0.192156862745098,25,25,Los Angeles Times,latimes.com

A woman who tried to take her own life after a court cleared her ex-partner of coercive control is backing a campaign to open up the justice system.

Charlotte, 30, is supporting the Open Justice campaign, which is calling for a change in the law to make court records freely available. She is just one of the serious crime complainants too traumatised to attend full hearings being asked to pay for court transcripts to understand judges' decisions.

Crown courts can charge ­thousands of pounds for these and magistrates court sessions are not routinely recorded. One rape victim was quoted £7,500 for a transcript of the full trial. It typically costs around £45 to £60 to provide a transcript of a judge's sentencing remarks.

Charlotte, who asked that we not use her last name, was devastated after her ex-partner was cleared of ­coercive control in January. After giving evidence at a magistrates court, she was too upset to attend the rest of the hearing in person.

Justice Secretary Alex Chalk

But she said: ""If I had, I would have been sat in the public gallery next to my ex-partner's sister. I wasn't given the option of watching a video link in a side room so I have no idea what happened in the trial and why the district judge reached the verdict she did.""

Charlotte claims that all she has is a solicitor's note saying the judge thought she was ""unreliable"" because it took her eight months to go to the police. She said: ""My mental health has gone down the drain. The day I got the verdict, I tried to kill myself... I need to know what was said to get closure and move on.""

Charlotte, of Hackney, East London, has joined London's Victims Commissioner, Claire Waxman, to call for crown court sentencing remarks and judges' summing-up to be given for free. They also want crown court sentencing remarks routinely published, magistrate hearings to be recorded and the Victims Code updated to say victims can attend trials after giving evidence.

Charlotte said there are at least 10 people formally involved in the campaign and more backing it. And Lib Dem MP Sarah Olney is among 38 ministers and charities to send Justice Secretary Alex Chalk an open letter highlighting it. She said: ""It beggars belief some victims are charged thousands to read what was said in a trial that impacts them so profoundly. Justice should not have a price tag.""

The Ministry of Justice said judges may provide transcripts to victims at their discretion, adding: ""The fee covers the considerable costs [of] writing up the recording of potentially weeks of hearings.""

Attorney General John Formella identified the suspect in Friday's shooting as 33-year-old John Madore. Formella said Madore was homeless and had recently spent time at a hotel on the Seacoast and then in Concord.

After the shooting, a U-Haul truck was found idling in the hospital's parking lot. New Hampshire State Police Col. Mark Hall said the bomb squad inspected the truck and determined it wasn't a public safety threat. Inside the truck, an AR-style rifle, tactical vest and several rounds of ammunition were found. Formella didn't confirm if it was connected to Madore.

The security officer killed in the shooting was identified as 63-year-old Bradley Haas, a 28-year veteran of the Franklin Police Department and the department's former chief. After Haas was shot, Hall said a state trooper assigned to the hospital responded immediately shot and killed Madore. The trooper's identity won't be released until an investigation is completed. Formella said several other people were in the lobby at the time but didn't say if they were patients, staff or visitors.

Please try again later{{ /verifyErrors }}

Donald Trump may still appear on the 2024 primary presidential ballot in Colorado, a state judge ruled - shutting down efforts to remove the former president by invoking the 14th Amendment.

The attempt to remove Mr Trump from the ballot was based on the claim that he is constitutionally barred from office because of the January 6 insurrection.

Earlier, the judge in Donald Trump's civil fraud trial brought against him by New York Attorney General Letitia James threw out the former president's bid for a mistrial.

Justice Arthur Engoron said he could not ""in good conscience"" let Trump pursue a request that was ""utterly without merit.""

The ruling comes after Mr Trump launched a fresh attack on Judge Engoron's court clerk almost as an appeals court judge paused the gag order which was introduced following his previous comments about her on social media.

The former president took to Truth Social to take advantage of the opportunity to attack the judge's ""ridiculous"" and ""unconstitutional"" gag order, and his ""politically biased and out of control, Trump Hating Clerk"".

Meanwhile, in the Washington, DC, federal case against Mr Trump concerning 2020 election interference, Justice Tanya Chutkan denied a motion to remove language relating to violence during the January 6 Capitol riot from the indictment.

The former president's legal team argued the statements were prejudicial but the judge noted the jury would not receive a copy of the indictment.","{'uri': 'independent.co.uk', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'The Independent'}",[],https://static.independent.co.uk/2023/11/17/20/SEI180297119.jpg?quality=75&width=1200&auto=webp,eng-9072064,-0.2784313725490196,25,25,The Independent,independent.co.uk

Welcome to this week's edition of the Deadline: Legal Newsletter, a roundup of top legal stories, including the latest developments from the Supreme Court, Donald Trump's legal cases and more. Click here to have the newsletter delivered straight to your inbox every Friday this Supreme Court term.

The Supreme Court finally released an ethics code this week, but it's barely worth the paper it's printed on. For one thing, as MSNBC Daily columnist Jessica Levinson pointed out, there's no enforcement mechanism. Sure, there's something to be said for the court responding to public scrutiny -- even if half-heartedly and condescendingly -- but this response doesn't inspire confidence in the institution. So it was good to see Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse, D-R.I., of the Judiciary Committee tell Nicolle that he still wants subpoenas for Harlan Crow and Leonard Leo, two of the men behind scandals that prompted scrutiny leading up to the code's begrudging issuance.

Another high court embarrassment this week was called out by Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson. Writing for herself and the other two Democratic appointees, Jackson noted an ""indisputable legal error"" in a solitary confinement case. The lower court had ruled against a prisoner who was kept for years without exercise in an unsanitary cell the size of a parking space. But it takes four justices to review a case, and the irrefutable blunder wasn't enough for a single GOP-appointed justice on the 6-3 court to care. Rather, three of those Republican appointees -- Clarence Thomas, Samuel Alito and Neil Gorsuch -- displayed their priorities when they dissented from their colleagues' declining to grant Florida the ability to enforce its anti-drag law.

Turning, as we inevitably do, to the man who appointed a third of the court, Donald Trump's diverse legal docket continued apace, as he pushed to delay the federal election interference case pending the resolution of his immunity claim. However, the judge presiding over his Washington prosecution, Tanya Chutkan, hasn't seemed eager to entertain Trump's delay attempts ahead of his March trial date. We can't say the same for Trump's appointee in Florida, Aileen Cannon, whose actions continue to call the May classified documents trial date into question.

In his civil fraud trial in Manhattan, Trump's lawyers filed a mistrial motion that doubled as a political screed. In it, they complained that Judge Arthur Engoron and his law clerk are biased against Trump, and that the gag order Engoron imposed because of the former president's statements about the clerk, and the enforcement of that order, are themselves proof of bias. It's hard to take seriously the claim that the gag order that Trump practically begged for shows the judge is biased against him, especially when Engoron has levied only paltry fines when enforcing it.

Trump is also appealing the New York gag order itself (which Engoron extended to Trump's lawyers), and a state appellate judge temporarily lifted it on Thursday. So at least for a time, Trump is ungagged, as it were, because the order limiting his verbal attacks in the federal election case has also been temporarily stayed as he challenges that one, too. Oral argument on the latter order is set for Monday in the Washington federal appeals court.

Meanwhile, in Trump's Georgia case, some of his former co-defendants made waves when media outlets published parts of their proffer videos this week. That's how we learned, for example, that Jenna Ellis said Trump aide Dan Scavino told her their boss wasn't planning on leaving office despite his 2020 election loss to Joe Biden. But could Ellis, a former Trump campaign lawyer who pleaded guilty in a no-jail deal, offer that testimony against Trump if she were called to the stand at trial? I explored the issue here.

And can Trump even become president again in 2024? We saw movement this week in some of the 14th Amendment suits pending across the country. Following last week's Minnesota Supreme Court ruling that punted on the eligibility question, a Michigan judge not only did the same but found the constitutional issue is a ""political"" one for Congress, not courts, to resolve. The Michigan challengers have vowed to appeal, while the Colorado judge presiding over a similar case heard closing arguments this week on whether the amendment's insurrection clause keeps Trump from office. We're awaiting her ruling any day now. Remember, however these initial decisions shake out, the U.S. Supreme Court likely has the final word. But when will we find out either way? As my colleague Hayes Brown explained, it might not be until the very last minute.","{'uri': 'msnbc.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'MSNBC.com'}",[],"https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_nbcnews-fp-1024-512,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2023-11/231117-donald-trump-cs-a813e9.jpg",eng-9072064,0.06666666666666665,25,25,MSNBC.com,msnbc.com

A federal judge has to decide whether sediment runoff from the controversial ""Cop City"" police and fire department training center near Atlanta violates the Clean Water Act and is cause for stopping the project temporarily, after hearing both sides of the argument this week.

The judge may also dismiss the underlying environmental lawsuit, as defendants have asked the court.

At stake is whether construction can continue on the project's 171-acre footprint in a forest south-east of Atlanta if pre-established state limits on sediment running off the site into Intrenchment Creek were already exceeded before the project started, as plaintiffs allege - and are even higher now.

Opposition to the project is in its third year, and entered global headlines after police shot and killed activist Manuel Paez Terán, or ""Tortuguita"", on 18 January, while camped nearby in a forest public park. The killing of the environmental activist was the first of its kind in American history.

The motion for a preliminary injunction pits Atlanta-based environmental group, the South River Watershed Alliance (SRWA), against the city and the Atlanta Police Foundation (APF), the non-profit organization behind the training center project.

If the suit is successful, it could also lead to courts elsewhere being more likely to enforce the federal law, which would help clean up other rivers, said Jon Schwartz, attorney for SRWA. The creek flows into South River, which American Rivers, a national environmental group, named in 2021 as one of ""America's Most Endangered Rivers"".

The plaintiffs filed the motion and the underlying citizen lawsuit based on Clean Water Act violations in August and this week was the earliest a judge could hear arguments on their bid to pause the project, even as clear-cutting and the pouring of cement have continued apace.

One question district court judge - and Trump appointee - Jean-Paul Boulee asked repeatedly underscored the case's importance, as he asked defendants to name a previous district court opinion that offered guidance in considering such a citizen suit. They proffered a supreme court case that involved one state suing another over development affecting water quality.

A central legal issue in the case are 15 words in the state's general permit for development projects, created by the Environmental Protection Division: ""No discharges authorized by this permit shall cause violations of Georgia's in-stream water quality standards"". Those standards - including sediment levels - are set in accordance with the Clean Water Act, and plaintiffs say the project is causing such violations and will continue to do so.

The issue of sediment is not a trivial one, as ""sediment runoff is the No 1 polluter of rivers and streams in the US, and the reason the [federal] Environmental Protection Agency classifies them as 'too dirty' for fish and other fauna"", said Sarah H Ledford, a geosciences professor at Georgia State University.

This runoff then affects macroinvertebrates - insects in their nymph and larval stages, snails, worms, crayfish and clams, for example - which play important roles in aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems.

The city and APF disagreed about sediment levels entering the creek, and also made sweeping arguments about the public interest they say would be impaired if the project is halted even temporarily.

The two-hour hearing was visually striking in its contrasting display of resources, as Schwartz sat on one side facing the judge, while five attorneys sat on the other. The Atlanta chief of police, Darin Schierbaum, also sat in the audience through the proceeding, as did top fire department staff.

When Judge Boulee asked about balancing public interests, Schwartz asserted ""there will no be irreparable harm"" to Atlanta or APF if the project is paused, and that the police will continue to train in existing facilities. Meanwhile, he said, ""you undermine confidence in the rule of law if the city is violating [federal] law"".

But Simon Bloom, attorney for the APF, claimed that the training center ""is the single most important public safety project in decades in this city - maybe since the conversion of buggies to cars"".

He also accused the plaintiffs of having political motivations, not environmental ones, and that not seeing any ""dead fish"" meant there was no ""evidence of irreparable harm"". He noted that sediment measurements offered by plaintiffs were nine months old - which Ledford, who researches urban water quality, said was because the USGS, a federal agency, stopped measuring turbidity in the creek, a proxy for sediment levels, in February.

The agency said the move was prompted by safety concerns surrounding protesters against the project - but in March, within weeks of USGS removing the gauge, DeKalb county closed the public park portion of nearby South River Forest, removing access by activists to what had been ongoing campsites in protest against ""Cop City"".

Police officers have also monitored the construction site on the ground and by helicopter since then, and there have been no incidents that authorities have described as violent or dangerous. Plaintiffs also submitted photos taken more recently to the court, showing sediment entering the creek from a tributary running off the construction site.

""It's an academic conversation and does not rise to the level of empirical evidence this court needs,"" Bloom said. Plaintiffs also included testimony from a handful of scientific and policing experts; defendants had none.

Bloom also referred to the property destruction some of the activists opposing Cop City have engaged in - including the burning of 12 cement trucks the day before, belonging to a local company that had been photographed working on the site. ""We're ... building in a war zone,"" he said.

Jackie Echols, SRWA board president, said afterward: ""I was really just appalled. Given the serious nature of the Clean Water Act, the issues related to water quality - I was surprised at the theatrics.""

Ledford underscored that the case was ""not just about environmental harm, but environmental justice harm"", as neighborhoods surrounding the Cop City site are mostly Black, and the area has a history of industrial pollution.","{'uri': 'theguardian.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","[{'uri': 'timothy_pratt@theguardian.com', 'name': 'Timothy Pratt', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': False}]",https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/12f0209f4e06602d6cfb220bb8ce616e7516cb33/0_93_4320_2592/master/4320.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&s=b41c392af73e9992a0be484dfd25e567,,-0.1607843137254902,25,25,The Guardian,theguardian.com

Please try again later{{ /verifyErrors }}

Rishi Sunak is considering a plan to defy the UK's Human Rights Act as part of his desperate push to get his Rwanda deportation flights off the ground.

It comes as the PM comes under growing pressure from Suella Braverman and the Tory right to flaunt international law by ""disapplying"" the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR).

Mr Sunak is reportedly weighing up some elements of the hardline plan by Ms Braverman - whom he sacked earlier this week - to thwart fresh legal challenges to Rwanda flights.

The Tory leader is considering an emergency bill that would deem Rwanda a ""safe country"" and make clear this overrides the Human Rights Act, according to The Times.

A less contentious option is to try to designate Rwanda a ""safe"" country without any attempt to override human rights law, with the two possibilities said to be part of ""live"" discussions.

Mr Sunak's two-pronged strategy to dealing with the Supreme Court ruling against the government is to announce an emergency law that he says will enable parliament to ""unequivocally"" declare Rwanda a safe destination for asylum seekers.

The PM will also publish an upgraded agreement with the country which is expected to attempt to address the court's concerns around ""refoulement"" - the potential for refugees rejected by Rwanda to be sent back to the country they are fleeing.

But Ms Braverman has demanded Mr Sunak goes further - saying she ""demands of the government an end to self-deception and spin."" She wrote: ""Tinkering with a failed plan will not stop the boats.""

She said any of the UK's domestic or international obligations - the Human Rights Act and the ECHR - need to be made invalid using ""notwithstanding clauses"".

Senior Tory MP Danny Kruger, co-founder of the increasingly influential New Conservatives group, demanded that Mr Sunak ""change course or we will lose the general election"".

Writing in The Telegraph, the leading right-winger warned No 10 that failure to get the Rwanda flights going could lead to a ""formal split"" in the Conservatives and ""splinter"" the party forever.

""We need the Emergency Rwanda Bill to assert supremacy over all the laws and international treaties invoked by the Supreme Court,"" Mr Kruger wrote.

""This is existential. If we get this wrong, our party won't just face rejection at the ballot box, but we risk splintering our coalition forever.""

He said Mr Sunak's response to the Supreme Court ruling ""makes me worry that they are not prepared to cut through the thicket of international and domestic laws and protocols that undermine parliament's sovereignty"".

But Mr Sunak is facing concerns over the dilemma from both sides of his party, with the leading One Nation Tory moderate Damian Green stressing the importance of observing the rule of law.

""It's not just all our own laws passed by parliament, and all international treaties that we have signed, that Suella wants to sweep away,"" Mr Green told BBC Radio 4's Today programme - before comparing Ms Braverman to dictators.

""Conservatives believe in a democratic country run by the rule of law. And dictators, Xi and Putin, would prefer to have the state completely untrammelled by any law. And so, as a democrat I oppose it.""

Immigration minister Robert Jenrick reportedly backs elements of Ms Braverman's Rwanda plan in a ""belt and braces"" push to get the flights to take off.

The Home Office minister had joined Ms Braverman in previously submitting proposals to No 10 which included four of the five points she outlined this week, according to The Telegraph.

On Friday Mr Sunak denied ""tinkering"" with the Rwanda policy after his sacked former home secretary suggested his plan to save the scheme would fail without more radical measures.

Speaking to broadcasters, Mr Sunak insisted he will ""work night and day"" to ensure domestic courts cannot ""systemically"" block flights to the east African nation.

Mr Sunak declined to say whether he would call a general election if the upper chamber blocked the new law - instead insisting it was up to Labour to help it reach the statute books.

Meanwhile, Lord Sumption, a former Supreme Court judge, told the BBC the plan to use a law to declare Rwanda as safe was ""profoundly discreditable"", ""constitutionally really quite extraordinary"", and would ""effectively overrule"" a decision by the UK's highest court.

A government source said the treaty with Rwanda would be published ""shortly"", but perhaps not as soon as Monday, as reports earlier suggested.

The president's 29-year-old granddaughter, Naomi Biden, lives with her husband in Georgetown, a historic waterfront stretch of D.C. packed with trendy bars and restaurants, scenic sidewalks and a handful of foreign embassies.

The incident comes amid a rash of car break-ins in the upscale community, according to neighbors. Signs posted around the tree-lined streets warn drivers not to leave any valuables in their vehicles.

Just steps away from what neighbors identified as her home and the scene of Sunday's shooting, an off-duty officer two years ago thwarted a robbery in progress and engaging in a shootout with the suspects, according to police.

""The officer intervened in an ongoing armed robbery where two suspects, one armed, approaches a vehicle occupied three times with three victims, demanding either the vehicle or cash or other belongings from these individuals,"" DC Police Executive Assistant Chief Ashan Benedict said at the time. ""The officer engages the armed suspect - shots were fired.""

The Secret Service assisted in arresting one of the suspects in that incident, Benedict said.

It was not immediately clear whether the Secret Service was present on behalf of Biden during that incident - uniformed division officers also patrol near the city's foreign embassies and routinely come to the aid of city police when needed.

""While our primary focus is to ensure the highest levels of safety and security for our protectees and our protected sites, the Secret Service Uniformed Division also has an excellent working relationship with the DC Metropolitan Police Department,"" said Anthony Guglielmi, the Secret Service's chief of communications. ""Our agencies work together every day in various operational capacities and the DC Police Department also supports our protective mission in many ways, and we are grateful for the hand in glove relationship.""

Washington, like many U.S. cities, is struggling to combat rising crime.

Another Georgetown shooting, this one in January 2022, left a 27-year-old man from Alexandria, Virginia, dead in the street, according to FOX 5 DC.

WHITE HOUSE BLOCKS REPORTERS FROM COVERING NAOMI BIDEN WEDDING: 'DEEPLY DISAPPOINTED'

Police statistics show increases in both the thefts of vehicles and of property inside vehicles this year. Even U.S. Rep. Henry Cuellar, D-Texas, fell victim when a group of masked men he described as ""punks with guns"" carjacked him near his Washington apartment building.

In Washington's Second District, which includes Georgetown, more than a thousand additional property crimes have been reported year to date in 2023 compared to 2022. The area has seen 399 stolen vehicles, 1,207 thefts from inside vehicles and nearly 3,000 other types of theft.

""She can choose anywhere she wants to live, and we would just do our best to keep her safe - and our vehicles safe,"" said Thom Bolsch, a former agent who now runs a range in Texas. ""You're running out of good, clean safe areas to live.""

Secret Service agents are bound by the same rules of engagement as other law enforcement officers, Bolsch told Fox News Digital.

""The only reason you're allowed to discharge your weapon is your life, you feel your life is in danger, or someone else is in danger and you want to protect them,"" he told Fox News Digital. ""Maybe they can articulate that. If they just randomly shot at people running away from them, that's not how it's supposed to be done.""

The security team would have had cameras and surveillance in place around the protectee's residents and would be monitoring constantly.

If the agent who opened fire on the would-be thieves feared for his life, or the life of someone else, he would have been justified in the shooting. Authorities have revealed few details, although the Secret Service said in a statement there was no threat to its protectees.

City police said no one was hurt in the incident and three suspects fled in a red car.

Bolsch, who no longer lives in Washington, said Georgetown used to be considered very safe but that crime has been ""creeping"" into nicer neighborhoods in the wake of widespread anti-police protests demanding departments be defended around the country.

""With defund the police, they don't have enough officers,"" Bolsch said. ""Small, petty crimes are what they don't have the ability to enforce, and then when you do arrest somebody they get out by the time you finish the paperwork.""

City police are conducting a routine investigation into law enforcement's use of force in connection with the shooting near Biden's home.","{'uri': 'foxnews.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'Fox News'}","[{'uri': 'michael_ruiz@foxnews.com', 'name': 'Michael Ruiz', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': False}]",https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2023/11/1024/512/2023-10-25T233642Z_689406585_RC2ZZ3AG20MW_RTRMADP_3_USA-AUSTRALIA-e1700248284829.jpg?ve=1&tl=1,,-0.2784313725490196,25,25,Fox News,foxnews.com

The decision came down just before 5 p.m. Friday. At issue was whether he was barred from the ballot by a provision of the U.S. Constitution that forbids those who ""engaged in insurrection"" from holding office.

Colorado Secretary of State Jena Griswold released this statement shortly after the ruling, ""The Court determined that Donald Trump is eligible to be placed on the Colorado ballot in the March Presidential Primary. This decision may be appealed. As Secretary of State, I will always ensure that every voter can make their voice heard in free and fair elections.""

Advocates this year have been trying to remove Trump from the ballot in Colorado and other states under Section Three of the 14th Amendment, which bars from office those who swore an oath to uphold the U.S. Constitution and then ""engaged in insurrection"" against it. The measure has only been used a handful of times since the period after the Civil War.

""At the end of the day Colorado voters are going to be able to choose who they want for President and that's what matters,"" said Trump attorney and former secretary of state Scott Gessler.

In her decision, Wallace said she found that Trump did in fact ""engage in insurrection"" on Jan. 6 and rejected his attorneys' arguments that he was simply engaging in free speech. Normally, that would be enough to disqualify him under Section 3, but she said she couldn't do so for a presidential candidate.

""I'm surprised at the way the order was structured. Usually what will happen is courts will decide first whether or not the law applies even before we go forward to a trial. In this instance we have a trail and then she ruled that the law didn't apply,"" said Gessler.

Section 3 does not specifically refer to the presidency, as it does members of the U.S. Senate or House of Representatives. Instead, the clause refers to ""elector of President and Vice President,"" along with civil and military offices.

""Part of the Court's decision is its reluctance to embrace an interpretation which would disqualify a presidential candidate without a clear, unmistakable indication that such is the intent of Section Three,"" the judge wrote.

""It sets up an interesting situation if you think about it,"" said Norm Provizer a professor emeritus of political science at Metropolitan State University of Denver who has taught Constitutional law for decades. ""Was he involved in the insurrection? Yes. Except the President wasn't meant to be covered,"" he summarized.

Gessler was glad to take the victory in court. ""The judge threw a lot of shade on President Trump and you know, we'd rather not have that. At the end of the day though, we won this."" The Trump campaign released a statement saying in part, ""We applaud today's ruling in Colorado, which is another nail in the coffin of the un-American ballot challenges.""

The lawsuit was filed by six republican and unaffiliated voters backed by the left-leaning group Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington.

""This is the first time a presidential candidate has been found to have engaged in insurrection, and it was found after a thorough evidentiary hearing,"" said the organization in a statement.

Plaintiff attorney Mario Nicolais said, ""we are very pleased with the opinion and look forward to addressing the sole legal issue on appeal, namely whether Section 3 of the Fourteenth Amendment applies to insurrectionist presidents.""

They plan to appeal to the Colorado Supreme Court. The case is all but certain to be appealed all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court.

Closing arguments in the lawsuit, which was filed by the left-leaning group Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, wrapped up on Wednesday. Sean Grimsley, an attorney for the petitioners, argued that Trump engaged in an insurrection by inciting a violent mob to attack the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6 to try to stop the peaceful transfer of power. He says that makes him ineligible to hold office under the 14th Amendment. Trump attorney Scott Gessler says there's no evidence that Trump intended to incite violence and violence, he says, doesn't equal an insurrection.

Gessler said the lawsuit amounts to election interference and is based entirely on the Jan. 6 Committee's report which he says is completely one-sided.

""The petitioners are asking this court to do something that's never been done in the history of the United States,"" Gessler said. ""The evidence doesn't come close to allowing the court to do it.""

The trial, which ended two weeks ago, included testimony from D.C. riot police, rallygoers, constitutional experts, and two members of Congress.

The Colorado plaintiffs' attorney, Sean Grimsley, told the judge during Wednesday's hearing that the evidence was clear.

""We are here because, for the first time in our nation's history, the president of the United States engaged in an insurrection,"" he said, summing up their case. ""Now he wants to be president again. The Constitution does not allow that.""

If they can keep Trump off the primary ballot in enough states, advocates hope to keep him from getting the needed delegates to secure the Republican presidential nomination.

Regardless of the judge's decision, the case is all but certain to be appealed all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court.

Similar lawsuits challenging Trump's ballot eligibility under the 14th Amendment have failed recently in Michigan and Minnesota. The Minnesota Supreme Court dodged the question of whether the provision applies to Trump, who is so far dominating the Republican presidential primary. It dismissed a lawsuit to toss him off that state's primary ballot by saying that political parties can allow whomever they want to qualify for primaries. The court left the door open for a general election challenge if Trump becomes the GOP nominee. A Michigan judge dismissed another lawsuit seeking to bounce Trump from that state's primary ballot with a more sweeping ruling. He said whether the provision applies to the former president is a ""political question"" to be settled by Congress, not judges. The liberal group that filed the Michigan case, Free Speech For People, said it plans to appeal the decision.

The Trump campaign has called the lawsuits ""election interference"" and an ""anti-democratic"" attempt to stop voters from having the choice they want next November.","{'uri': 'cbsnews.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'CBS News'}",[],https://assets1.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2023/11/16/e8fe01fc-c63d-414d-9d9b-fd16f2d84e4a/thumbnail/1200x630/9fc2cd33a98ac9c0fa94927dd69d1513/l-trump-ballot-trial-5vo-frame-874.jpg?v=5659e73acd91751548aa89950cf015b0,eng-9068426,0.1372549019607843,25,25,CBS News,cbsnews.com

City is back at ‘centre of the international stage’ but must enact its own security law to complement the one implemented by Beijing in 2020, he says

Hongkongers must stay vigilant to guard against people with “ulterior motives” and foreign forces trying to “sow discord” or bring back social unrest, the city’s leader has warned, underscoring that stability is needed to attract investment.

Chief Executive John Lee Ka-chiu on Saturday told the 2023 Fight Crime Conference that violence seen during the months-long protests in 2019 could return at any time and the city must enact its own national security law by next year.

“I have a profound feeling, when interacting with guests from all over the world at different events, that Hong Kong must have a stable environment if it is to attract global investors,” Lee said at the first edition of the conference after a five-year hiatus following the protests and Covid-19.

“We should therefore stay vigilant at all times,” he said, warning against the presence of “soft resistance”.

“Everyone who loves Hong Kong should take national security as the starting point in staying alert and guarding against those with ulterior motives or foreign forces who try to sow discord in the city,” he said. “We should object and refute any smear campaigns with ill intention [against Hong Kong].”

Lee said the national security law imposed by Beijing in the wake of the protests had achieved immediate results in ending the chaos, declaring Hong Kong was back to the “centre of the international stage” with its rebound in tourist numbers and return of mega events.Finance chief will tell ‘true stories’ about Hong Kong at Apec summit: John Lee

He also stressed the city needed to complete the legislation of its own national security legislation, as stipulated in Article 23 of the Basic Law, the city’s mini-constitution, by next year to complement the Beijing-decreed law. The goal was spelled out in Lee’s policy address last month.

Speaking at a sharing session with the leaders and members of various district crime-fighting committees, Secretary for Justice Paul Lam Ting-kwok said it was necessary to change the attitude of some residents towards the Beijing-imposed law, which he said was every time it was mentioned.

He likened the security legislation to a vaccine which protected residents against disease.Hong Kong’s John Lee ‘strongly’ condemns US bill to sanction 49 local officials

“Behaviours that endanger national security are like the viruses and bacteria that we see everywhere, [and] the goal of the national security law is like a vaccine injection,” he said. “Our intent is not to hurt you, we just do not want you to fall sick or die.”

Lam emphasised that the national security law was “defensive” and not “offensive”.

“We are not targeting residents, we are targeting the external elements who are hurting the healthy survival of our society,” he said.

The conference on Saturday was organised by the Fight Crime Committee to provide a platform for its members, and those from the 18 district crime-fighting bodies, to exchange views on law and order. The high-level event was also attended by No 2 official Eric Chan Kwok-ki and security minister Chris Tang Ping-keung.","{'uri': 'scmp.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'South China Morning Post'}",[],https://cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/d8/images/canvas/2023/11/18/0588ce1c-a4a3-4cd4-8bb8-f4c9b89ea806_428f0091.jpg?itok=765J2WB8,,-0.0980392156862745,25,25,South China Morning Post,scmp.com

Rep. Elise Stefanik, a member of House GOP leadership, has filed new documents to her judicial ethics complaint from last week against the judge overseeing former President Donald Trump's civil fraud trial in New York.

In a letter Friday, the New York lawmaker added to her complaint by attaching the mistrial motion filed by Trump's attorneys accusing Judge Arthur Engoron of bias. The judge dismissed the mistrial bid on Friday afternoon.

The 30-page motion filed by Trump on Wednesday was ""wrongly denied"" by Engoron, Stefanik said in Friday's letter. Her original complaint accused the judge of exhibiting ""clear judicial bias"" against the former president, and called on him to recuse himself.

The complaint argued that Engoron had illegally infringed on Trump's protected political speech and that he violated political contribution rules by making donations to Democrats as recently as 2018.

In a statement to NBC News, Stefanik said on Friday that the mistrial motion adds ""examples of even more of his egregious misconduct"" by Engoron to the complaint filed with the New York State Commission on Judicial Conduct.

""A week ago, I filed an ethics complaint against Manhattan Judge Arthur Engoron for his partisan antics, bias, and railroading of President Trump,"" Stefanik said. ""After my complaint, a New York appellate court smacked down Judge Engoron for his blatantly unconstitutional gag order. Today, I'm supplementing my ethics complaint against Judge Engoron with examples of even more of his egregious misconduct after he just wrongly dismissed President Trump's motion for a mistrial.""

In shooting down Trump's bid for a mistrial, Engoron called the former president's arguments ""utterly without merit.""

Engoron is presiding over a bench trial in the $250 million lawsuit, meaning he will issue a verdict and determine any resulting penalties. The case stems from a lawsuit filed by New York Attorney General Letitia James last year that accuses Trump of inflating asset values for financial gain. He has denied wrongdoing.","{'uri': 'nbcnews.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'NBC News'}",[],"https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_nbcnews-fp-1024-512,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2023-11/231117-rep-elise-stefanik-wm-457p-edf456.jpg",eng-9072064,-0.3647058823529412,25,25,NBC News,nbcnews.com

An appeal is expected and could ultimately be resolved by the Colorado Supreme Court or the U.S. Supreme Court. Wallace's ruling came a week and a half after the Minnesota Supreme Court ruled Trump could not be removed from the primary ballot in that state and three days after a Michigan judge reached the same conclusion.

Despite the decision's blunt wording and findings, Trump campaign spokesman Steve Cheung championed the ruling, calling it ""another nail in the coffin of the un-American ballot challenges.""

Trump opponents have been bringing their lawsuits state by state in hopes of ultimately securing a U.S. Supreme Court ruling that keeps the leading Republican candidate off the ballot in all states. The cases are moving quickly because caucuses and primaries will be held starting in January.

Adopted in 1868, three years after the end of the Civil War, the 14th Amendment granted citizenship to those born or naturalized in the United States and guaranteed civil rights to all Americans, including those who had been enslaved. The amendment's lesser-known Section 3 was aimed at limiting the power of former Confederates by barring from office those who had sworn an oath to the Constitution and later engaged in insurrection.

Although Wallace found that Trump engaged in insurrection, she determined Section 3 does not apply to him. Section 3 refers to some offices and refers to those who are an ""officer of the United States,"" but does not specifically mention the presidency.

The Allegheny County Health Department ordered the Kuhn's on Banksville Road to close for an imminent hazard after an inspection on Friday. A sign posted on the store Friday night read, ""The store is temporarily closed due to a drain issue and no running water.""

The inspector said there was an active sewage backup in ""critical"" parts of the store like the kitchen and food storage area. The report says the inspector saw employees ""engaging in business as usual during an emergent situation.""

The inspector could tell the sewage was improperly cleaned because there was a lack of residual chlorine in stagnant water around those areas, the report says, and there was evidence of prior backups in customer areas of the deli section.

No one in charge notified the Health Department of an emergency situation, which the inspection report says is a repeat violation.

The grocery store's health permit also expired on Oct. 31.

Before reopening, the health permit needs to be renewed and a plumber needs to diagnose plumbing issues with video evidence.

A Colorado judge has turned away a challenge looking to disqualify former President Donald Trump from running for president under an interpretation of the 14th Amendment that argued he engaged in insurrection against the United States on Jan. 6, 2021.

The ruling came in a case brought by progressive activists who sued the state, arguing that Trump was barred from returning to the office. A handful of courts in other states turned away similar challenges.

The case in Colorado was brought by the liberal government watchdog group Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington.

A Colorado judge on Friday rejected a 14th Amendment challenge to Donald Trump being on the state's presidential ballot next year.

The ruling follows a trial over Trump's eligibility under the Amendment's insurrection clause. The Colorado case is one of several legal challenges pending across the country in which voters have cited the constitutional amendment to try and keep the former president off the presidential ballot in 2024.

Courts in Minnesota and Michigan recently punted on the 14th Amendment question. The Minnesota Supreme Court said it's up to state Republicans to determine whether to put Trump on the primary ballot and that the question of general election eligibility is premature. A Michigan judge issued a similar ruling but went further in deeming the constitutional question a ""political"" one that's for Congress, not courts, to decide. It doesn't appear that the Minnesota ruling is being appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court, but the Michigan challengers have vowed to appeal the lower court ruling at least through the state judicial system.

The U.S. Supreme Court will likely have the final word on the subject, though it's not yet clear in which case -- or cases.

Wallace issued a ruling in the Trump ballot eligibility case, ordering the Colorado secretary of state to place Trump on the state's primary ballot for next year.

The ruling is another victory for Trump after courts in Minnesota and Michigan this month rejected similar legal efforts to disqualify the him from running for president in those states.

A group of Colorado voters filed a legal challenge to Trump's candidacy in September, arguing that his efforts to overturn the 2020 election results and his and conduct surrounding the Jan. 6, 2021, Capitol riot violated Section 3 of the 14th Amendment to the Constitution, making him ineligible for office.

The lawsuit alleged Trump ""engaged in insurrection or rebellion"" after having sworn an oath to support and defend the Constitution and asked the court to declare that Trump is constitutionally ineligible to appear on any Colorado ballot for state or federal office and to prohibit Secretary of State Jena Griswold from allowing his name to appear on any future primary or general election ballots in the state.

Wallace began hearing arguments in the case last month, with closing arguments in the trial taking place Wednesday.

""Through his actions, and his actions alone, Donald Trump has disqualified himself from ever holding office again,"" attorney Sean Grimsley said in a closing argument on behalf of the petitioners.

The former president is facing a string of efforts in other states to keep him off the ballot in 2024 on similar grounds. The Minnesota Supreme Court ruled last week that state law did not bar a major political party from placing a candidate who is ineligible for office on the presidential nomination primary ballot, and a Michigan judge denied a similar effort on Tuesday, finding that the secretary of state lacked the authority to intervene.

In his closing argument, Trump attorney Scott Gessler highlighted those cases, asserting that there is ""an emerging consensus here within the judiciary across the United States.""

Top election officials in Arizona, New Hampshire and elsewhere are also weighing concerns similar to those raised in Colorado as they prepare state ballots for next year's Republican presidential primaries, where Trump is leading in the polls among Republican contenders.","{'uri': 'nbcnews.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'NBC News'}",[],"https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_nbcnews-fp-1024-512,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2023-11/231115-donald-trump-silhouette-2020-ac-1121p-0163d3.jpg",eng-9068426,-0.3176470588235294,25,25,NBC News,nbcnews.com

Former President Donald Trump's name will remain on the Colorado 2024 presidential primary ballot, a judge ruled Friday.

The decision came following a legal challenge seeking to disqualify Trump from appearing on the ballot, citing the 14th Amendment.

The lawsuit sought to use the Disqualifications Clause, or Section 3 of the 14th Amendment, which bars individuals who have ""engaged in insurrection or rebellion"" against America or who have aided those engaged in such activities from holding office, and specifically cited Trump's alleged involvement in the Capitol riot of Jan. 6, 2021.

Watchdog group Citizens for Responsibility and six Colorado voters filed the lawsuit in September, one of multiple legal attempts in a number of states across the country aiming to prevent Trump winning another four years in the White House.

The decision comes after a Michigan judge ruled Wednesday in a similar lawsuit that Trump would also remain on that state's primary ballot, which followed the Minnesota Supreme Court and a federal judge in New Hampshire previously dismissing other challenges.

The New York state judge presiding over Donald Trump's $250 million New York civil fraud case knocked down his bid for a mistrial on Friday, calling the former president's arguments ""utterly without merit.""

In a brief and blunt ruling, Judge Arthur Engoron said he was refusing to even allow arguments on the mistrial motion because the premises of the motion were flawed and it would be ""futile."" The judge described Trump's rationale for halting the trial, now in its second month, as ""disingenuous,"" made in ""bad faith"" and ""nonsensical.""

Trump's attorneys filed the mistrial motion Wednesday, arguing that Engoron and his law clerk had demonstrated bias against the former president. They also accused the clerk, who sits alongside the judge in the courtroom, of improperly acting as a ""co-judge"" in the case.

The clerk's ""position as a de facto co-judge"" violates the judicial code and ""creates the appearance, if not the fact, of a co-judge presiding over the trial,"" they wrote.

Engoron, who last week issued a gag order barring Trump's lawyers from disparaging the clerk after having previously fined Trump for comments about her, denied the allegations from Trump's attorneys, as he'd previously done in court.

He said he has the ""absolute unfettered right"" to consult with his clerk however much he wants, and ""as I have made clear over the course of this trial, my rulings are mine and mine alone. There is no 'co-judging' at play.""

The judge also disputed the allegation from Trump's attorneys that his clerk had made political donations to Democrats that exceeded the legal limits. Engoron said the lawyers had their facts and math wrong, adding that the clerk's financial contributions ""were well below the ethical and legal permissible annual limit"" and that the attorneys had not taken into account that his clerk had been running for a judgeship herself.

He also called the arguments about her being biased ""nonsensical"" and a ""red herring"" since the clerk ""does not make rulings or issue orders -- I do.""

In response to assertions that he was biased when he said during Trump's testimony that he was not there to hear what the former president ""had to say,"" Engoron called those accusations ""disingenuous"" and a ""bad faith"" argument. The judge noted the lawyers ""omitted what I said immediately after that sentence, which is 'I'm here to hear him answer questions.' Indeed, those are precisely the roles of the witness and the finder of fact.""

Trump's lawyers had also charged that the judge has ruled against them much more than he'd ruled against New York Attorney General Letitia James' office, who brought the fraud claims against Trump and his company. Engoron called that argument ""similarly without merit.""

""I stand by each and every ruling, and they speak for themselves,"" he said on Friday.

Trump attorney Alina Habba said she was not surprised by the ruling.

""As expected, today the Court refused to take responsibility for its failure to preside over this case in an impartial and unbiased manner. We, however, remain undeterred and will continue to fight for our clients' right to a fair trial,"" she said in a statement.

On Thursday, Trump's lawyers filed an appeal of Engoron's gag order barring them and their client from complaining about the clerk. The judge had said he was concerned the focus on the clerk could jeopardize her safety and the safety of his staff. A state appeals court judge temporarily lifted Engoron's gag order after Trump's attorneys alleged his First Amendment rights were being violated.

The temporary pause is expected to remain in place until a full panel of state Appellate Division judges considers the appeal later this month.","{'uri': 'nbcnews.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'NBC News'}",[],"https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_nbcnews-fp-1024-512,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2023-11/231115-donald-trump-court-ew-107p-9ca76e.jpg",eng-9072064,-0.3411764705882353,25,25,NBC News,nbcnews.com

The teenager was behind the wheel of a white 2023 Volkswagen Taos that had been reported stolen out of Montgomery County, Maryland, police said.

He and his passenger, 20-year-old Nicholas Battle of Glen Burnie, attracted the attention of detectives assigned to Anne Arundel County's Criminal Investigation Division Auto Theft Task Force as they were traveling through Glen Burnie.

The task force members were patrolling the area near the University of Maryland Baltimore Washington Medical Center as part of an initiative to curtail incidences of motor vehicle theft in Anne Arundel County, according to authorities.

The task force members allegedly tried and failed to conduct a traffic stop on the vehicle when it was near the intersection of Elvaton Road and Tall Pines Court, according to authorities.

The teenage driver ""accelerated quickly in reverse toward the detective's police vehicle,"" ramming it, police said.

The teen drove off and was pursued by other officers until he stopped the vehicle. After that, both he and Battle attempted to run away from the officers, according to authorities.

Task force members were finally able to apprehend them in the 1000 block of Upton Road, police said.

The teen driver was found to be in possession of a key fob for the stolen Volkswagen Taos and Battle was found to be in possession of a key fob for a stolen 2019 Nissan Altima, according to authorities.

But Democrats said the move was made to help out with the governor's political ambitions by shielding his travel from public scrutiny.

The media organization first sued the Florida Department of Law Enforcement, the agency which keeps DeSantis' travel records, over the summer after it rebuffed the Post over four separate public records requests. Florida Circuit Judge Angela Dempsey ordered FDLE to turn over all ""nonexempt public records"" following a September court hearing, but the agency said certain records were exempt due to the new law.

In late October, lawyers for the Post filed a 25-page motion asking that Dempsey order the law-enforcement agency to hand over additional records, asserting that the travel records exemption was overly broad and unconstitutional. Florida voters in 1992 passed a ""Sunshine amendment"" that guarantees the public's access to government records and open meetings.

""The exemption sweeps from public view every record relating in any way to the expenditure of millions of taxpayer dollars each year, including the most basic information needed to inform the public about what those services are for, when they were provide, who received them and why,"" states the motion filed by the Post's lawyers. ""The Florida Constitution prohibits such a gaping disconnect between the narrow justification for an exemption and its sweeping coverage.""

Dempsey, who earlier this year sided with lawyers from the DeSantis administration and ruled that the governor can withhold records under a never-before-applied doctrine of ""executive privilege,"" is scheduled to consider the Post's motion at a January hearing.

A Post spokesperson said the company does not comment on pending litigation. POLITICO is using the same law firm representing The Post -- Ballard Spahr -- to raise questions about FDLE's ongoing delay to comply with public record requests made by POLITICO.

DeSantis' travels, including his use of state jets acquired after he became governor as well his reliance on private planes either chartered or owned by GOP donors, have come under scrutiny, especially after he began his campaign for president.

POLITICO previously raised questions about flights he took during a book promotional tour shortly before he officially began his campaign. The Washington Post reported in September about undisclosed flights DeSantis took between his election in 2018 and his inauguration while POLITICO reported last month that Florida's former economic development agency paid nearly $1.6 million for an international trade mission. The bulk of the money was spent on two chartered jets that took the governor, along with first lady Casey DeSantis and other state officials and business leaders, to stops in Japan, South Korea, Israel and England.

The Post states that in April of this year -- which was before the new law took effect -- the news organization asked FDLE for all records related to DeSantis' plane travel dating back to January 2019. After the initial court order demanding the state turn over some records, the Post's legal filing states FDLE discussed what it would turn over and provided examples of travel records in its possession, including memorandums concerning reimbursements paid to DeSantis' reelection campaign for use of the state plane.

But FDLE did not hand over all those records and instead gave the Post copies of annual FDLE reports that track overall spending by the agency on security and transportation costs. In the court filing, the Post attorneys maintained the agency decided to ""renege on the parties deal.""

The Post's legal challenge also maintains FDLE has not turned over all records related to a request to look at FDLE emails regarding the Tampa Convention Center, which was the site of DeSantis' 2022 election night party. The Post was seeking emails related to efforts to ban concealed weapons from the Convention Center.","{'uri': 'politico.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'POLITICO'}",[],https://static.politico.com/c4/ca/af367e6c46cb92e6b029e08cfffe/https-delivery-gettyimages.com/downloads/1774781457,,0.3333333333333333,25,25,POLITICO,politico.com

Six more law enforcement officers have been charged with failing to intervene during the fatal shooting of Christian Glass, who called 911 while experiencing a mental health crisis in Clear Creek County, Colorado, in 2022, the district attorney's office said Friday.

Randy Williams, a Georgetown marshal; Georgetown police Officer Timothy Collins, who was at the time a deputy in Clear Creek County; Colorado State Patrol trooper Ryan Bennie; Idaho Springs police Officer Brittany Morrow; and two Colorado Gaming Commission officers, Christa Lloyd and Mary Harris, were all criminally charged with misdemeanors.

On Thursday, former Clear Creek County Deputy Kyle Gould pleaded guilty on charges of failing to intervene. Gould, the supervisor of Andrew Buen, the former Clear Creek County deputy who fatally shot Glass, was not on the scene, but provided direction while watching live bodycam recording.

During the encounter, according to body camera footage, Gould called for officers to break into the SUV that Glass was driving. A Clear Creek County District judge sentenced Gould to two years of unsupervised probation and issued him a $1,000 fine; Gould is not allowed to work in law enforcement or security.

Buen pleaded not guilty to charges of second-degree murder, official misconduct and reckless endangerment earlier this month.

Last year, HuffPost found that Buen was being sued for excessive force over a 2019 incident where he allegedly choked a man and kneeled on his back. The Clear Creek County Sheriff's Office settled the case for $15,000 in February.

On June 11, 2022, Glass, who was 22, called 911 and said his vehicle was stuck.

""I'm in a vehicle and my vehicle got stuck, in a really bad way,"" Glass said on the call. ""I have a weapon on me. I will throw them out of the window as soon as an officer gets here.""

The 911 operator who contacted officers described Glass as ""very paranoid."" Seven officers from five departments arrived on the scene, and recordings from the scene indicate that officers talked about a potential ""psych issue.""

Glass told officers he was ""terrified"" when they arrived.

Buen eventually fired at least five shots at Glass, who did not leave his vehicle at any point. Bodycam footage shows that none of the other officers intervened.

The county sheriff's department argued that Buen fired shots at Glass because he would not drop a knife after being told to do so.

Glass' family reached a $19 million settlement, one of the largest payouts related to an individual killed by police in Colorado.

In a statement on Friday, Col. Matthew Packard, chief of the Colorado State Patrol, said he had reviewed the bodycam footage and felt that Bennie, in particular, had not violated policy. He acknowledged that Glass should be alive, and described his death as a tragedy.

""In my review, I found no indication that Trooper Bennie violated any Colorado State Patrol policy or training. I am shocked by the decision of the District Attorney to pursue charges against Trooper Bennie,"" Packard said in the statement. ""While the outcome of this case is pending, Trooper Bennie will be reassigned to an administrative position.""","{'uri': 'huffpost.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'HuffPost'}",[],https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/6557d054230000df71ea602a.jpeg?ops=1200_630,eng-9069006,-0.2627450980392156,25,25,HuffPost,huffpost.com

A unanimous three-judge panel of the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals said that because deportation proceedings are civil and not criminal, non-citizens are not entitled to Miranda warnings typically recited by police during a criminal arrest regardless of whether a warrant is involved.

The court upheld an order to deport Jose Maria Zuniga De La Cruz, a Mexican citizen who had sought to block the fact that he had admitted to immigration officers that he was in the United States illegally from being used as evidence in his case.

The U.S. Department of Justice and a lawyer for Zuniga did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

The 1966 U.S. Supreme Court decision in Miranda v. Arizona says prosecutors cannot use criminal defendants' statements against them unless they were first informed of their constitutional rights to counsel and against self-incrimination.

At least seven appeals courts, including the 9th Circuit, have ruled that Miranda does not apply to civil immigration proceedings.

Zuniga, who had been in the United States since 2004, was arrested outside of his home in 2018 by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officers who had obtained an administrative warrant. The officers said Zuniga admitted that he was in the U.S. illegally.

Unlike criminal arrest warrants, which must be signed by a judge, administrative warrants are approved by an ICE official based on evidence that a person is illegally present in the country.

Zuniga said the statements he made to the officers were coerced and he moved to suppress them, claiming that Miranda applied to his case. He argued that an arrest backed by an administrative warrant is ""closer to a criminal arrest,"" according to Friday's decision.

An immigration judge denied the motion and ordered Zuniga to be deported, and the U.S. Board of Immigration Appeals affirmed. The 9th Circuit on Friday rejected Zuniga's appeal.

""It is the nature of the proceeding in which the inculpatory statements are to be used and not the nature of the arrest that is relevant,"" Circuit Judge Daniel Bress wrote.

Circuit Judge Salvador Mendoza in a concurring opinion agreed that Miranda did not apply to civil proceedings. But non-citizens have constitutional rights, he wrote, and the 9th Circuit should consider adopting a similar requirement for deportation cases.

""Though Mr. Zuniga's Miranda argument fails, it raises important questions: when should immigration officers advise noncitizens of their rights, and what exactly should this prophylactic warning look like?"" wrote Mendoza, an appointee of President Joe Biden.

Bress, who was appointed by Republican former President Donald Trump, in response to Mendoza said there was no legal basis to grant those rights.

""Miranda, which does not apply here, is not authority for creating new versions of itself in the immigration context,"" he wrote.

The panel also included U.S. District Judge Joan Ericksen of the District of Minnesota, who sat by designation.

The case is Zuniga De La Cruz v. Garland, 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, No. 21-352.

Fenton, located in Jefferson Davis Parish, has just one main road, one library, one gas station, one town hall.

In June 2022, a staggering $1.3 million was generated through fines and forfeitures, just as much revenue as Shreveport, which has a population of 187,000.

The teeny village collected its revenue primarily traffic tickets, more than almost any other municipality in Louisiana in a single year, audits revealed, ProPublica reported.

Those who have a gripe with their ticket or fines must appeal to Fenton town's mayor, Mayor Eddie Alfred, Jr., who appears to serve a dual role.

He is responsible for the town's finances and also is the town's judge. As the judge, he appoints the prosecutors, and if drivers request a trial, he decides if they are guilty or innocent.

The fines were collected through the 'mayor's court'. Its purpose is to process the thousands of speeding tickets that were written up yearly by officers from the Fenton police department.

The town of Fenton, located in Jefferson Davis Parish in Louisian, is compromised of approximately twenty blocks. The one-mile stretch of highway is located between central Louisiana and east Texas along U.S. Route 165

The revenue collected reportedly contributes to part of the salaries of the mayor, the clerk, and others, the news outlet revealed.

The village located in Jefferson Davis Parish is compromised of approximately twenty blocks. The tiny town has a city hall, a gas station, a church, a library, a dollar store, and some public housing units.

Those who drive along the one-mile stretch of highway - located between central Louisiana and east Texas along US Route 165 - are either town residents or those heading to east Texas from central Louisiana.

Mike Holmes, Fenton's village attorney told WVUE-TV and ProPublica in an email that the mayor presides over court in a 'neutral, impartial manner' consistent with Louisiana law.

He also claimed that tickets are only dismissed at his discretion.

However, the village's court records show a different story on how some tickets are handled, and revealed the challenges they faced trying to get answers.

The teeny village collected its revenue primarily traffic tickets, more than almost any other municipality in Louisiana in a single year

Journalists from WVUE and ProPublica who were trying to find out exactly how the court in Fenton operates visited the town four different times. During those visits, they reviewed court files, town meeting minutes, municipal ordinances and body camera video.

They also requested electronic case summaries over a three-and-a-half year period. Though they tried to see the court in action, they reported that they were only able to witness court one time. They also noted that they were only got to speak with the mayor for five minutes.

Many officials offered conflicting explanations for the mayor's role, how and why tickets are reduced or dismissed, why the town asks the state to suspend so many drivers' licenses and how often trials are held.

Their description of how the town runs its court didn't align with state Judicial College guidance or that U.S. Supreme Court ruling.

Joel Friedman, an emeritus professor at Tulane University in New Orleans who has taught procedural law for 46 years, told ProPublica: 'There's no accountability. They can do whatever they want.'

'The mayor who's trying to raise money for the city is in charge of prosecuting these minor criminal offenses and getting fines brought back to the city,' he added.

Another attorney, who wrote a book about the matter, agreed with Friedman and told the news outlet that Fenton shouldn't allow the mayor to preside over court.","{'uri': 'dailymail.co.uk', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'Daily Mail Online'}",[],https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2023/11/17/20/77940951-0-The_town_of_Fenton_located_in_Jefferson_Davis_Parish_that_is_com-a-32_1700251575335.jpg,,-0.003921568627450966,25,25,Daily Mail Online,dailymail.co.uk

Zhenyu Wang, 42, and Daniel Ray Lane, 42, were found guilty on Wednesday, and each face a maximum penalty of 45 years in prison. The two men had planned to purchase petroleum from Iran, mask its origins, and then sell it to a refinery in China, the department said in a statement.

Lane was president of privately held Stack Royalties, a Texas-based company that sells oil and gas mineral rights to investment funds and private equity groups.

Lane's attorney, Paul Hetznecker, told Reuters in a statement that the case was based on undercover government agents who offered Lane ""millions of dollars in profits"" if he took part in the scheme, after initially rebuffing their approaches.

""This is an outrageous example of government overreach,"" Hetznecker said in a statement. He vowed to appeal the conviction.

An attorney for Wang did not respond to a request for comment.

The pair were charged, along with three others, in 2020 in U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania. Two co-conspirators have since pleaded guilty, court records showed.

The officers fired three dozen shots, officials said during a press conference Friday afternoon at Baltimore police headquarters where they played the recordings and presented the department´s view of them.

The shooting occurred Nov. 7, when officers on a District Action Team - a squad focused on seizing illegal guns - were proactively patrolling in southwest Baltimore. A man later identified as Hunter Jessup, 27, was killed during a short foot pursuit. The videos show him appear to fire his own weapon before he´s struck by gunfire and falls to the sidewalk.

Officials said they haven´t determined how many times Jessup was shot.

In the aftermath of the shooting, some community members questioned whether his death was necessary. They said officers on the department´s specialized gun squads have a reputation for displaying overly aggressive behavior and escalating otherwise peaceful encounters, especially in that neighborhood.

But Baltimore Police Commissioner Richard Worley has commended the officers´ actions, saying they protected public safety in an area plagued by violence. He also said they yelled at Jessup multiple times to drop his weapon before opening fire.

(Jerry Jackson/The Baltimore Sun via AP)

""While it´s an unfortunate incident, the investigation is still going on,"" he said, adding that officers will continue patrolling the area ""to provide greater visibility and better response times with the goal of deterring and preventing violent crime.""

Worley said police are trained to ""shoot to incapacitate"" whenever they encounter someone they consider ""a threat of deadly violence,"" which often means continuing to shoot until the threat has passed. In this case, the officers fired 36 shots at Jessup, Worley said.

The entire interaction lasted less than a minute.

The videos show police in two vehicles talking with two men standing on a corner. The men lift their shirts in response to a request from the officers, who saw a ""bulge"" in Jessup´s clothing, officials said. Off-camera, he takes off running. Officers pursue him on foot and by car, converging on a sidewalk around the corner.

One officer jumps out of a vehicle and tries to tackle Jessup, despite the gun in his right hand, but he slips away. Others point their weapons at him, repeatedly yelling at him to ""get on the ground"" and ""drop the gun."" Jessup keeps running and turns toward another officer as all four open fire.

During Friday´s news conference, officials pointed to a slowed-down version of the video that appears to show a bullet from Jessup´s gun striking a parked car. Officials said they´re still processing evidence to determine how many shots Jessup fired.

Worley said Jessup´s family members viewed the recordings from the four officers´ body cameras before it was made public.

A woman who answered the phone at a number listed for Jessup´s possible relative said she had no comment before hanging up.

Police said Jessup was under correctional supervision in a case from a different jurisdiction. They didn´t provide additional details about the case.

The Maryland Attorney General´s Office is investigating. Under a state law change that went into effect Oct. 1, the statewide office will decide whether to bring criminal charges against any of the officers involved. Previously, that decision fell to local prosecutors.

Baltimore´s DAT squads have been scrutinized, particularly after another police shooting unfolded under similar circumstances this year, leaving a teen in critical condition less than a mile from where Jessup was shot. Police tried to stop the teenager because they believed he was armed, and an officer shot him from behind as he ran away holding a gun in one hand.

Department leaders created the DAT squads after the Gun Trace Task Force was disbanded amid federal racketeering charges accusing several officers of systematically robbing the city and its residents using illegal searches and planted evidence. The corruption scandal helped prompt widespread reform efforts within the department, which has a long history of problematic interactions with the city´s Black community.

As to his clerk, Allison Greenfield, who has been the target of Trump and his lawyers since the start of the trial, Engoron also dismissed Trump's lawyers' concerns. Citing an article in conservative media, Trump's lawyers alleged that Greenfield had violated a court ethics rule by giving Democratic causes more than $500 in political donations per year.

Engoron acknowledged that clerks are prohibited from exceeding $500 in annual political donations, but he said Greenfield is governed by a different guideline because she is a candidate for a New York judgeship. Engoron cited a guideline that says the $500 limitation doesn't apply to a candidate's contributions to her own campaign and doesn't limit ticket purchases to political functions.

""When deducting the price of tickets to political functions that my Principal Law Clerk attended from all the contributions to which the defendants cite, the remainder is still well below the ethical and legal permissible annual limit,"" Engoron wrote.

Earlier this month, Trump's lawyers' complaints about Greenfield prompted the judge to issue a gag order preventing the lawyers involved in the trial from ""from making any public statements, in or out of court, that refer to any confidential communications, in any form, between my staff and me.""

His lawyers had complained about Greenfield's conduct on the bench -- she sits next to Engoron and often consults with him or passes him notes -- and had raised concerns about bias based on a Breitbart article about her political donations.

That gag order was the second of two the judge has issued. The first was also prompted by comments about Greenfield in the form of a social media post by Trump. Both gag orders were paused Thursday by an appeals court judge.

In his ruling Friday, Engoron also sought again -- as he has repeatedly during the trial -- to emphasize both his right to consult with his clerk and his independence.

""[A]s I have made clear over the course of this trial, my rulings are mine, and mine alone. There is absolutely no 'co-judging' at play,"" he wrote.

The 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals granted FirstEnergy's petition for interlocutory review on Thursday, signaling that the appellate court wants to be sure U.S. District Judge Algenon Marbley of Columbus, Ohio, properly certified a class of FirstEnergy shareholders and noteholders to pursue fraud claims stemming from a years-long political bribery scheme.

FirstEnergy (FE.N)agreed in 2021 to pay $230 million to resolve U.S. government charges that it paid tens of millions of dollars to Ohio state lawmakers in a push for a law to bail out two aging nuclear plants. Investors claim that the company is liable for the losses they allegedly suffered when a leading Ohio politician was arrested, and the bribery scheme came to light.

The appeal of Marbley's class certification decision, as I told you when FirstEnergy's appellate lawyers at Sullivan & Cromwell petitioned for 6th Circuit review last April, will address two hot-button issues in securities class actions.

The first is whether securities class actions alleging both fraudulent omissions and affirmative misrepresentations can be certified under the lenient Affiliate Ute test, which does not require investors to prove that they relied on deceptive omission, or the more stringent Basic test for fraudulent misrepresentations. As you know, U.S. Supreme Court precedent allows securities class action defendants to assert a variety of arguments to rebut the presumption, under the Basic test, that their alleged misstatements impacted the market for their stock and bonds.

Marbley certified the FirstEnergy class under the Affiliated Ute standard, reasoning that investors' claims ""primarily"" stemmed from FirstEnergy's failure to disclose the bribery scheme. The judge also said that he would have certified the class under the Basic standard, as lead shareholder counsel from Robbins Geller Rudman & Dowd pointed out in a brief opposing FirstEnergy's petition for review of the class certification order.

FirstEnergy nevertheless argued that the appeals court should step in to clarify that Affiliated Ute does not apply in cases asserting a mix of omissions and misrepresentations. In a brief responding to shareholders, the company asserted that seven other circuit courts have already rejected shareholder attempts to use the Affiliated Ute test to certify classes alleging ""half-truths.""

FirstEnergy's argument was amplified in friend-of-the-court briefs from several law professors and from two business groups, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association (SIFMA). The company's backers warned the 6th Circuit that Marbley's reliance on the Affiliated Ute test in a case alleging a mix of omissions and misrepresentations was an improper expansion of the more lenient standard.

Unless the appeals court clamps down, argued SIFMA and the Chamber, the 6th Circuit will become an outlier where investors get what amounts to a free pass to class certification.

""Absent the guardrails established by Basic and its progeny, public companies would be exposed to near automatic class certification, as plaintiffs will invoke the less demanding Affiliated Ute presumption in nearly every case,"" the law professors predicted in their brief.

The second issue raised in the interlocutory appeal is a bit more esoteric. The Supreme Court held in 2013's Comcast Corporation v. Behrend that classes cannot be certified unless plaintiffs' lawyers have offered a classwide model for calculating damages. In FirstEnergy, Robbins Geller provided expert witnesses who opined on calculating damages for noteholders asserting claims under the Securities Act and shareholders alleging Exchange Act violations.

But the company argued that Marbley fell short of Comcast's ""rigorous analysis"" requirement when he signed off on the proposed classwide damages model for investors' Exchange Act claims. According to FirstEnergy, the trial judge erroneously referred to the statutory damages model for noteholders' Securities Act claims in endorsing their Exchange Act claims, which are not based on the statute.

Robbins Geller countered that the full record on class certification - including dueling expert witness reports, hundreds of pages of deposition testimony and a lengthy hearing in which Marbley grilled both sides about damages -- shows that the trial judge properly scrutinized the class methodologies. The firm also said its proposed model for calculating shareholders' damages is ""the gold-standard, well-accepted method.""

The 6th Circuit panel that granted FirstEnergy's petition did not say whether the court is more interested in the Affiliated Ute or Comcast issue. Both of the amicus briefs backing the company devoted more space to protesting Marbley's application of the lenient Affiliated Ute standard, though both also faulted the trial court's analysis of shareholders' damages model.

Thursday's order noted that one factor the 6th Circuit considers in weighing a request for interlocutory appeal is the likelihood that the petitioner will prevail. But that's certainly not a guarantee that FirstEnergy will get the class decertified. The company, after all, told the 6th Circuit that shareholders are alleging $8 billion in damages. The appeals court may just want to double-check the trial court in a huge case based on one of the biggest public schemes in recent memory.

FirstEnergy counsel Robert Giuffra of Sullivan & Cromwell said in an email statement that he and his client are ""pleased that the 6th Circuit will review these important questions regarding the certification of securities class actions, including over the scope of the Affiliated Ute presumption and what is needed to satisfy the requirements of Comcast.""

Robbins Geller declined to provide a statement.

Ironically, the 6th Circuit decision to review the FirstEnergy class certification came on the same day that Robbins Geller formally agreed to end a 13-year-old shareholder class action against Goldman Sachs, after its loss last August in one of the hardest-fought class certification battles in the history of securities litigation. (The Manhattan trial judge certified a Goldman shareholder class three times but Goldman ultimately convinced the 2nd Circuit to decertify the class, based on the Supreme Court's 2021 decision in its own case.)

Sullivan & Cromwell was Goldman's counsel throughout the saga, so the FirstEnergy interlocutory appeal renews its class certification rivalry with Robbins Geller.

Cody Barnett of the conservative legal group Alliance Defending Freedom, representing therapist Kaley Chiles, told the three-judge panel of the 10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Denver that the 2019 law was ""blatant viewpoint-based speech suppression,"" and that speech in a therapy session was protected like speech in any other context.

""It doesn't really matter that she's a licensed counselor,"" he said. ""If she is speaking, she is speaking.""

Colorado Deputy Solicitor General Helen Norton, arguing for the state, said that talk therapy was the practice of medicine, and that medical professionals are required to follow the standard of care in their field.

She noted that major organizations like the American Psychological Association have said that efforts to change sexual orientation or gender identity, known as conversion therapy, are ineffective and can harm mental health.

""This is the regulation of professional conduct, which is different"" from simply restricting speech, she said. She noted that states also regulate the practice of law to protect clients, even though it consists almost entirely of speech.

Chiles sued state officials in Denver federal court last year, saying she was unable to counsel patients consistent with her Christian beliefs because of the law.

U.S. District Judge Charlotte Sweeney in December 2022 denied Chiles' motion for a preliminary order blocking enforcement of the law while the case proceeds. Chiles appealed that order.

Circuit Judge Harris Hartz, who was appointed by Republican former president George W. Bush, asked repeated skeptical questions of the state during Friday's argument, pressing Norton to provide evidence that conversion therapy was harmful, rather than simply noting consensus among medical organizations.

Norton pointed to studies supporting the conclusion, though she conceded that they involved so-called ""aversive techniques"" that attempt to make a patient associate unwanted thoughts or behaviors with physical discomfort, like electric shocks. Chiles says she only wants to use talk therapy, not aversive techniques.

Circuit Judges Veronica Rossman and Nancy Moritz, both appointed by Democratic presidents, appeared more skeptical of Chiles' case, questioning Barnett's argument that talk therapy could not be regulated like other healthcare treatments.

Colorado is one of more than 20 Democratic-led states that have passed anti-conversion therapy laws. The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals last year upheld a Washington state ban against a similar challenge, in which the plaintiff was also represented by Alliance Defending Freedom.

The case is Chiles v. Salazar, 10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, No. 22-1445.

For Chiles: Cody Barnett of Alliance Defending Freedom

For the state: Colorado Deputy Solicitor General Helen Norton

Trump´s lawyers had urged Judge Arthur Engoron on Thursday to stop the case immediately, arguing he had irreparably harmed Trump´s right to a fair trial through ""astonishing departures from ordinary standards of impartiality."" They cited his rulings against their client, the prominent role of the judge´s chief law clerk, the clerk's political donations and the judge's sharing of articles about the case with fellow alumni of his high school.

""My principal law clerk does not make rulings or issue orders - I do,"" Engoron wrote, adding that ""my rulings are mine, and mine alone.""

As for publishing a high school newsletter in which he has included links to articles about himself and the case, ""none of this has anything to do with, much less does it interfere with, my presiding fairly, impartially, and professionally over the instant dispute, which I have now been doing for more than three years, and which I intend to do until its conclusion,"" he wrote.

Trump attorney Alina Habba released a statement saying: ""As expected, today the Court refused to take responsibility for its failure to preside over this case in an impartial and unbiased manner. We, however, remain undeterred and will continue to fight for our clients´ right to a fair trial.""

Messages seeking comment were sent to state Attorney General Letitia James' office, which brought the civil case now on trial. The lawsuit alleges that Trump, his company and top executives exaggerated his wealth by billions of dollars on his financial statements, which were given to banks, insurers and others to secure loans and make deals.

Trump and the other defendants deny any wrongdoing.

Last week, Engoron spurned the defense´s request to end the trial through what´s known as a directed verdict.

Downing Street is planning to bring in emergency legislation and a new treaty with Kigali to address issues in the judgment.

The PM -- accused by former Home Secretary Suella Braverman of ""tinkering"" with the original scheme -- said he would work ""night and day"" to ensure domestic courts can't ""systematically"" block deportation flights.

He said: ""We've got to get the Rwanda plan up and running. I will do whatever it takes to make that happen.

""People are sick of this merry-go-round. I want to end it. My patience is wearing thin.""

He threw down the gauntlet to Labour to help pass the legislation, especially in the Lords.

Trump's attorneys made the request on Thursday, claiming Judge Arthur Engoron and his law clerk had displayed bias and that he conferred with her so much it was as if they were ""co-judging"" the case. Engoron explicitly denied that claim on Friday, and called the motion ""without merit.""

""My rulings are mine, and mine alone. There is absolutely no 'co-judging' at play,"" Engoron wrote. The judge and his clerk, Allison Greenfield, have been the subject of fierce criticism by Trump and his lawyers, who claim they have overwhelmingly favored New York Attorney General Letitia James' side in the case.

The trial, which began Oct. 2 and is expected to last into December, stems from a September 2022 lawsuit in which James' office alleges that Trump, two of his sons and their company engaged in a decade of fraud tied to Trump's financial statements. James is seeking $250 million for the state and additional penalties that would restrict the defendants' ability to do business in New York.

Engoron found the defendants liable for fraud in a pretrial ruling. The trial is proceeding on other allegations related to falsification of business records, conspiracy and insurance fraud and the appropriate damages and penalties to be imposed.

Judge Engoron ruled that Trump and his campaign twice violated a limited gag order the judge put in place Oct. 3, after Trump posted a derogatory statement on social media about Greenfield. He's been ordered to pay $15,000 in fines related to the gag order violations.

In the motion for a mistrial, the Trump attorneys complained that Engoron consulted too frequently with Greenfield. Trump's attorneys announced plans to file it the day he testified in the case on Nov. 6, capping off an intense day of examination in which Trump -- who has frequently criticized Judge Engoron and his clerk -- even lashed out at the judge from the witness stand, pointing at him and calling him a ""fraud.""

In the filing, Trump's attorneys claim that ""the Court has abrogated its constitutional responsibility to ensure each Defendant, including President Trump, receives a fair trial free from even the appearance of impropriety and impartiality.""

Engoron wrote that he has an ""absolute unfettered right to consult with my law clerks in any way, shape, or form I choose.""

The attorney general had proposed a briefing schedule to address the mistrial motion, but Engoron ruled that was unnecessary, calling the motion itself ""without merit"" and writing ""subsequent briefing would therefore be futile.""

A total of 356 asylum seekers were intercepted by Border Force officials from seven boats and escorted into Dover, Kent, throughout the day.

Around 50 asylum seekers were picked up from an inflatable dinghy off the coast of Dover and brought to shore on Border Force catamaran Hurricane shortly before 10am.

The mostly male group, who were clad in hooded jackets and hats after battling chilly conditions at sea, could be seen removing their orange lifejackets as they were escorted along the former jetfoil to be taken for processing.

At least 40 more asylum seekers were escorted into the port on a Border Force catamaran shortly after midday, while a similar-sized group were brought in on another of the agency's vessels around an hour later.

They appeared cold, wrapping red blankets around their heads and shoulders as they disembarked the boat.

Four more dinghies carrying migrants were intercepted throughout the day.

This comes as the Supreme Court concluded unanimously that the Rwanda scheme to deport arrivals immediately would break the law.

President of the Supreme Court Lord Reed said there would be a risk of genuine asylum seekers being returned by Rwanda to the home country they fled from.

The decision immediately sparked Tory demands to loosen protections under the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) so the policy can go ahead.

At the time, Tory Party deputy chairman Lee Anderson said the Government should simply 'ignore the laws' and 'just put the planes in the air now and send them to Rwanda'.

Sacked Home Secretary Suella Braverman had accused Prime Minister Rishi Sunak of having 'no Plan B' if the policy was blocked by judges.

The PM responded to the Supreme Court ruling by pledging a new treaty with Rwanda and emergency legislation allowing Parliament to declare the East African country safe for asylum seekers.

And in a nod to the fury of the Tory Right, he insisted if that failed he was ready to ignore the European Convention on Human Rights rather than let 'foreign courts' stand in the way of action.

The PM said that planes should start leaving for Rwanda next Spring - although he would not guarantee the timetable.

'Let me tell everyone now - I will not allow a foreign court to block these flights,' Mr Sunak said.

'If the Strasbourg Court chooses to intervene against the express wishes of Parliament I am prepared to do whatever is necessary to get flights off.

'I will not take the easy way out.'

Just six asylum seekers were rescued from the Channel by French authorities after getting into difficulty while trying to make the crossing on Thursday, according to France's Prefecture Maritime.

A French escort vessel was pictured accompanying one of the migrant boats into English waters yesterday

In the early hours of the morning, the CROSS rescue centre in Cap Gris-Nez, northern France, was informed that a migrant boat was in difficulty off the coast of Equihen beach.

The French Navy boat Rhône picked up six people and dropped them off at the port of Boulogne later on in the morning, where they were taken care of by the departmental fire and rescue service and the border police.

A total of 971 people have crossed the Channel in 19 boats this month - an average of 51 people crammed into each vessel.

This brings the total number of small boat crossings so far this year to 27,670 in 565 inflatable dinghies.

Last year saw a record 45,755 people make the journey across the 21-mile Dover Strait.

This is 60 per cent higher than in 2021, when 28,526 asylum seekers reached the UK.","{'uri': 'dailymail.co.uk', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'Daily Mail Online'}",[],https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2023/11/17/20/77945323-0-image-a-27_1700254699369.jpg,eng-9063836,0.06666666666666665,25,25,Daily Mail Online,dailymail.co.uk

The ABA's Council of the Section of Legal Education and Admissions to the Bar, which oversees law schools, voted unanimously to send the free speech proposal to the ABA's House of Delegates in February for final approval. The ABA's law school accreditation rules have long protected the academic freedom of faculty, but this standard would be the first address free speech for the entire law school community.

The new rule would require all law schools to develop and publish policies that ""encourage and support the free expression of ideas."" Those policies, if the rule is adopted, must protect the rights of faculty and staff and students to communicate controversial or unpopular ideas and safeguard robust debate, demonstrations, or protests. They must also forbid disruptive activities that hinder free expression or substantially interfere with law school functions or activities.

The proposed rule does not include any specific enforcement mechanism, but law schools that do not adhere to the ABA's standards risk losing their accreditation.

Campus free speech debates have intensified since Hamas' Oct. 7 attack on Israel and Israel's responding assault on Gaza, with Israeli and Palestinian supporters clashing. But free speech has been a hot topic in legal education for more than two years following controversies at a several high-profile schools -- which played a role in developing the ABA's new free speech requirement.

Students at Stanford Law School and Yale Law School disrupted controversial speakers, sparking criticism of how the schools handled those situations. Stanford officials apologized to 5th U.S. Circuit Judge Stuart Kyle Duncan after students disrupted his remarks to the campus Federalist Society chapter in March. The law school also mandated free speech training for students.

Yale Law School said it bolstered its commitment to free speech after a group of students disrupted a campus discussion with an invited conservative speaker in March of 2022. That incident prompted two federal judges to later say they would not hire clerks from Yale.

ABA council members also said that efforts by lawmakers to restrict the teaching of subjects such as critical race theory also helped to spur the new free speech requirement. The ABA's House of Delegates will weigh final approval of the proposal when it meets on Feb. 5 in Louisville, Kentucky.

Please try again later{{ /verifyErrors }}

A federal judge heard arguments Friday from lawyers for a group of Indiana residents from Haiti who are suing the state over a law that allows immigrants in the U.S. on humanitarian parole to get driver's licenses, but only if they are from Ukraine.

The five plaintiffs say the law passed this year is discriminatory and unconstitutional, and they asked the court to strike down the law's provision that limits its scope to people from Ukraine.

U.S. District Court Judge Tanya Walton Pratt said she will issue a ruling at an unspecified date.

The lawsuit was filed in August against the Commissioner of the Indiana Bureau of Motor Vehicles. The plaintiffs are represented by attorneys with the American Civil Liberties Union of Indiana and the National Immigration Law Center.

The law provides an avenue for immigrants on humanitarian parole from Ukraine to obtain driver's licenses and identification cards. The class-action lawsuit seeks to force the Bureau of Motor Vehicles to offer the same opportunities to immigrants on humanitarian parole from other countries.

Attorneys argue in court documents that the law violates the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the equal protection clause of the U.S. Constitution. It also creates its own immigration classifications, which is an authority reserved by the federal government, they contend.

ACLU lawyer Gavin Rose described the law in court as ""a textbook example of national origin discrimination.""

Four of the five Haitian immigrants -- who are all on humanitarian parole -- live in rural areas without public transportation, according to court documents. They rely on others for rides to work and other everyday activities such as grocery shopping. The final plaintiff is a minor who wishes to receive an identification card, the documents state.

The lead plaintiff, Jeffson Saint-Hilaire, 25, said he came to the U.S. to provide for his mother and two sisters who live in Haiti.

""I just want to be self-sufficient, self reliable,"" he told reporters. ""But how can I do that without a driver's license?""

According to the complaint, Saint-Hilaire was admitted to the U.S. in March and is employed as an electrician's assistant. He has a second job as an interpreter, but he often has to turn down assignments due to his travel restrictions.

""It's very important for me. And not just me, but all these people here on humanitarian parole to get access to these driver's licenses,"" he said.

The state argues that the law was adopted to mirror provisions in Congress's Additional Ukraine Supplemental Appropriations Act, and therefore does not conflict with federal law or federal immigration classifications.

""Indiana's mode to be welcomed should be approved, not penalized,"" attorney William Bock said on behalf of the state.

Attorneys with the state also argue that restrictions in the law limit its scope to a certain time frame, which means it isn't available to all people from Ukraine.

However, the Haitians' attorneys say the time restrictions were specifically designed to aid people from Ukraine.

According to the state, 136 people whose last residence was Ukraine and who were put on humanitarian parole between February 2022 and this September have received driver's licenses under the new law.","{'uri': 'independent.co.uk', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'The Independent'}",[],https://static.independent.co.uk/2023/11/17/19/Indiana_Driver_Licenses-Discrimination_Lawsuit_71170.jpg?quality=75&width=1200&auto=webp,eng-9071964,-0.06666666666666665,25,25,The Independent,independent.co.uk

(KDKA) -- Two men are facing charges after police said a fight in Turtle Creek ended with shots fired and one of the men hitting the other with a car.

Allegheny County police said surveillance video of a fight outside a business on Penn Avenue in Turtle Creek on Thursday night showed 25-year-old Tyvon Stevenson punching 53-year-old Rattandeep Virk in the face.

The fight continued into the parking lot, where police said Stevenson took out a gun and pointed it at Virk. Investigators said no shots were fired, and surveillance video showed Stevenson leaving the plaza.

Police said Virk then got into his vehicle and drove along Penn Avenue. When he found Stevenson, investigators said Virk hit Stevenson with his vehicle multiple times.

After he was hit, police said Stevenson fired multiple shots toward the vehicle. Again, no one was hit by gunfire.

Police said their investigation began after dispatchers were notified shortly after 8 p.m. of shots fired and a pedestrian hit by a vehicle along Penn Avenue. Detectives from county police's General Investigations Unit were called in to investigate.

Stevenson was taken to a hospital to be treated for a lower leg injury and was last listed in stable condition, police said.

Virk was taken into custody on Friday and is facing multiple charges, including aggravated assault by vehicle, recklessly endangering another person, stalking and harassment. He's currently in the Allegheny County Jail pending his preliminary arraignment.

Stevenson was also charged with simple assault for the alleged fight outside the business.","{'uri': 'cbsnews.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'CBS News'}",[],https://assets3.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2023/10/30/e915d188-29be-43d2-b50e-8c786559d631/thumbnail/1200x630/9c4b1add9035d5876333ad03fb59bc64/gettyimages-1399782864.jpg?v=5659e73acd91751548aa89950cf015b0,,-0.388235294117647,25,25,CBS News,cbsnews.com

Donald Trump's lawyers on Friday argued that a limited gag order barring him from targeting witnesses constitutes judicial overreach and a grievous violation of the First Amendment.

The claim, made in an appeals court filing ahead of a hearing next week, seeks to permanently lift an order imposed by U.S. District Judge Tanya Chutkan last month in the federal case Trump faces for his efforts to remain in office after losing the 2020 presidential election, culminating in the Jan. 6, 2021, Capitol riot.

Chutkan's Oct. 16 order never barred Trump from speaking broadly about the case, in which he has pleaded not guilty. Instead, it narrowly constrained the former president and 2024 hopeful from targeting prosecutors, court staffers and potential witnesses.

Despite that, Trump's lawyers repeatedly described the order Friday as a ban on their client's broader political speech, painting Trump as the victim of ""a single federal judge"" whose court ""had no business inserting itself into the Presidential election, just weeks before the Iowa caucuses.""

""Criminal proceedings do not suspend the First Amendment; if anything, they heighten the need for First Amendment protections,"" they wrote in the brief.

Chutkan had temporarily lifted the order on Oct. 20 -- a reprieve Trump took advantage of to target Mark Meadows, his former chief of staff, amid reports that Meadows had been granted immunity to testify against him.

Soon after Chutkan suspended the order, Trump published a characteristically bizarre outburst on social media, wondering aloud if Meadows was a weakling and coward who would make a deal with prosecutors.

Chutkan reimposed the gag order after that post. A U.S. Court of Appeals decision then temporarily lifted the order, again, earlier this month, noting as it did so that the pause ""should not be construed in any way as a ruling on the merits.""

On Nov. 20, both sides are scheduled to argue before the appeals court as it considers a ruling on the matter.

In a separate civil fraud trial Thursday, a New York appeals court judge also paused a gag order against Trump that limited what he could say about court staffers. Shortly thereafter, Trump, who'd previously violated the order twice, went on an angry tirade focused on the judge and a court clerk.","{'uri': 'huffpost.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'HuffPost'}",[],https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/6557acd1220000b91518e4ec.jpeg?cache=y55yT33Uod&ops=1200_630,eng-9065743,-0.2470588235294118,25,25,HuffPost,huffpost.com

(AP) - Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis´ board appointees are seeking communications between Disney and local media, as well as documents related to the company´s position on Florida´s so-called ""Don´t Say Gay"" law, as part of a state court fight over control of the district that governs Walt Disney World.

The request for documents and communications was made Thursday by the Central Florida Tourism Oversight District, now controlled by DeSantis appointees. It sued Disney this year over control of the private government which regulates design and construction and provides municipal services such as mosquito control and road repairs at the Florida theme park resort.

The district wants all Disney communications about DeSantis, as well as communications dealing with laws passed by the Republican-dominated Florida Legislature that switched control of the district from Disney supporters to the governors´ appointees and nullified deals the company made with the Disney-controlled district before the state takeover.

The Central Florida Tourism Oversight District, formerly called the Reedy Creek Improvement District, was controlled by Disney allies for more than five decades until it was taken over by DeSantis appointees earlier this year. The takeover of the district came after Disney publicly opposed a state law banning classroom lessons on sexual orientation and gender identity in early grades. The law, dubbed by opponents as ""Don't Say Gay,"" was championed by DeSantis, who currently is running for the 2024 GOP presidential nomination.

Before control of the district changed hands from Disney allies to DeSantis appointees, the Disney supporters on its board signed agreements with Disney shifting control over design and construction at Disney World to the company. The new DeSantis appointees claimed the ""eleventh-hour deals"" neutered their powers, and the district sued the company in state court to have the contracts voided.

Disney has filed counterclaims which include asking the state court to declare the agreements valid and enforceable.

Advocates this year have been trying to remove Trump from the ballot in Colorado and other states under Section Three of the 14th Amendment, which bars from office those who swore an oath to uphold the U.S. Constitution and then ""engaged in insurrection"" against it. The measure has only been used a handful of times since the period after the Civil War.

Closing arguments in the lawsuit, which was filed by the left-leaning group Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, wrapped up on Wednesday. Sean Grimsley, an attorney for the petitioners, argued that Trump engaged in an insurrection by inciting a violent mob to attack the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6 to try to stop the peaceful transfer of power. He says that makes him ineligible to hold office under the 14th Amendment. Trump attorney Scott Gessler says there's no evidence that Trump intended to incite violence and violence, he says, doesn't equal an insurrection.

Gessler said the lawsuit amounts to election interference and is based entirely on the Jan. 6 Committee's report which he says is completely one-sided.

""The petitioners are asking this court to do something that's never been done in the history of the United States,"" Gessler said. ""The evidence doesn't come close to allowing the court to do it.""

The trial, which ended two weeks ago, included testimony from D.C. riot police, rally goers, constitutional experts, and two members of Congress.

The Colorado plaintiffs' attorney, Sean Grimsley, told the judge during Wednesday's hearing that the evidence was clear.

""We are here because, for the first time in our nation's history, the president of the United States engaged in an insurrection,"" he said, summing up their case. ""Now he wants to be president again. The Constitution does not allow that.""

If they can keep Trump off the primary ballot in enough states, advocates hope to keep him from getting the needed delegates to secure the Republican presidential nomination.

Regardless of the judge's decision, the case is all but certain to be appealed all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court.

Similar lawsuits challenging Trump's ballot eligibility under the 14th Amendment have failed recently in Michigan and Minnesota. The Minnesota Supreme Court dodged the question of whether the provision applies to Trump, who is so far dominating the Republican presidential primary. It dismissed a lawsuit to toss him off that state's primary ballot by saying that political parties can allow whomever they want to qualify for primaries. The court left the door open for a general election challenge if Trump becomes the GOP nominee. AMichigan judge dismissed another lawsuit seeking to bounce Trump from that state's primary ballot with a more sweeping ruling. He said whether the provision applies to the former president is a ""political question"" to be settled by Congress, not judges. The liberal group that filed the Michigan case, Free Speech For People, said it plans to appeal the decision.

The Trump campaign has called the lawsuits ""election interference"" and an ""anti-democratic"" attempt to stop voters from having the choice they want next November.","{'uri': 'cbsnews.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'CBS News'}",[],https://assets1.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2023/11/16/e8fe01fc-c63d-414d-9d9b-fd16f2d84e4a/thumbnail/1200x630/9fc2cd33a98ac9c0fa94927dd69d1513/l-trump-ballot-trial-5vo-frame-874.jpg?v=5659e73acd91751548aa89950cf015b0,eng-9068426,-0.2235294117647059,25,25,CBS News,cbsnews.com

The legal setback for the embattled politician came the same day that a West African regional court dismissed his case seeking his reinstatement. Sonko was recently returned to a Dakar jail after being hospitalized for several weeks amid a hunger strike.

Senegal's government formally dissolved Sonko's political party earlier this year and canceled his voter registration after he was convicted of corrupting youth. His followers maintain the charge and prosecution were politically motivated and aimed at derailing his candidacy in the February election.

A court in the southern city of Ziguinchor, where Sonko serves as mayor, ruled in favor of restoring him to the voter rolls but the Supreme Court ""quashed and annulled"" that decision, according to Sonko attorney Cire Cledor Ly. The case was remanded to the Dakar high court, he said.

Senegalese authorities have refused to give Sonko the sponsorship papers needed to officially register his candidacy.

Sonko, who finished third in the country's last presidential election, was widely seen as the main challenger to President Macky Sall´s ruling party. Sall ultimately decided not to seek a third term in office after Sonko´s supporters launched months of protests that at times turned deadly.

In June, Sonko was acquitted on charges of raping a woman who worked at a massage parlor and making death threats against her. But he was convicted of corrupting youth and sentenced to two years in prison, which ignited deadly protests across the country.

In late July, Senegalese authorities formally dissolved Sonko´s political party and placed him in detention. He is now facing charges of calling for insurrection, conspiracy against the state and other alleged crimes.

Sonko also had appealed to the Court of Justice of the regional bloc ECOWAS to contest both the dissolution of his party and the striking of his voter registration, but that court ruled Friday ""that none of Mr. Ousmane Sonko´s rights had been violated and dismissed his claims,"" Ly said.

DAKAR, Nov 17 (Reuters) - The presidential ambitions of jailed Senegalese opposition leader Ousmane Sonko suffered two setbacks on Friday after the Supreme Court annulled a lower court's decision ordering his reinstatement in the voter roll.

Separately, a West African regional court backed the government of Senegal in a legal battle with Sonko, who had filed a case claiming the state violated his human rights.

Sonko, 49, has faced a flurry of court cases over the past two years for charges including libel and rape, which he denies.

He was arrested in July for insurrection, the government dissolved his party, and he has been struck off the electoral roll, ruling him out of a presidential election next February.

A court in the southern town of Ziguinchor where his is the mayor, had ruled last month that Sonko should be reinstated in the voter roll and sponsorship sheets for the presidential election be handed to him, enabling him to run in the vote.

Following an appeal by the state, the Supreme Court annulled the Ziguinchor court, asking for the case to be decided afresh by a court of appeal in the capital, Dakar.

""I note that the court has transferred the baby to another jurisdiction, while there is no deadline set,"" Sonko's lawyer Cire Cledor Ly told journalists outside the court.

""We are moving towards a situation where Sonko will be prevented from getting the sponsorship sheet and submitting his candidacy (for the election),"" he said.

Earlier, the Community Court of Justice of the regional ECOWOS bloc rejected Sonko's claim that the state has treated him unfairly.

Sonko's charges and arrests have become a flashpoint in Senegal, triggering rioting this year in which at least 16 people died - the worst unrest in decades in the largely peaceful West African country.

His supporters say the charges are politically motivated and are part of President Macky Sall's serial targeting of political opponents, which Sall denies.

On what planet is our prime minister living (Rishi Sunak to bring in emergency law after supreme court's Rwanda ruling, 15 November)? Having failed miserably to get his odious Rwanda policy through the courts, he now plans to introduce ""emergency legislation"" to declare that Rwanda is a safe country.

Even if this were legally possible, how can the UK possibly monitor this? How could we ensure in practice that Rwanda meets its international obligations towards refugees, so that our own new law actually works in reality, especially as the supreme court makes it clear that Rwanda is currently a long way from being a safe country? It's completely unworkable.

This is fairytale politics. All Rishi Sunak has done with his ill-considered, panic-stricken response to the court ruling is to give us a further demonstration of his absolute desperation and his appalling judgment.

The problem with Rishi Sunak's plan to pass a law declaring Rwanda to be safe is that a law cannot make a fact otherwise. The supreme court gave good reasons why Rwanda was not a safe destination, and this fact will not be changed by any UK law. Nor will it be possible to prevent the European court of human rights from stopping deportation flights, unless the UK withdraws from the treaty that set it up.

Ultimately, the boats cannot be stopped without changes in the countries that asylum seekers come from, except by action that would damage Britain's international standing. That is why I believe it will not happen; nor will refugees be sent to Rwanda before the next election, as the Conservatives promise. A more humane way of treating refugees will have to be found.

It is extraordinary that the UK government should base its policy on the expectation that Rwanda will observe its human rights and international legal obligations when the prime minister and many in his party appear willing to implement that policy in disregard of the UK's similar obligations because they conflict with ""the will of the people"" (in reality, government policy).

As Rishi Sunak has discovered that Rwanda can be made a safe country by an act of parliament, let us hope he will not stop there, and other troubled countries will be similarly pacified. A Nobel peace prize cannot be in doubt when he succeeds.

Suella Braverman wants to act like a dictator with her alternative hardline Rwanda plan, a former Cabinet minister has claimed as he compared her to Vladimir Putin.

Responding to the former home secretary's five-point Rwanda plan set out in The Telegraph, Damian Green, the former deputy prime minister, said her proposal to pass a law that would block Rwanda deportation appeals was ""profoundly unconservative"".

In an interview on BBC Radio 4, Mr Green, chairman of the One Nation Conservative Caucus, said he ""disliked and opposed"" it because it would ""sweep away"" all judicial review protection for asylum seekers. ""It's not just all our own laws passed by Parliament, and all international treaties that we have signed, that Suella wants to sweep away,"" he said.

""She specifically says let's sweep away all judicial review protection and all common law protections, and that's why I said on Twitter that this is the most unconservative proposal I have ever heard.

""Conservatives believe in a democratic country run by the rule of law. And dictators, Xi [Jinping] and Putin would prefer to have the state completely untrammelled by any law. And so, as a democrat, I oppose it.

""But quite specifically as a conservative, because if we conservatives don't believe that the state should be controlled by the law, that the Government has to obey the law as much as you or I have to obey the law, then that seems to me to be very profoundly unconservative.""

'Whatever is required'

In her Telegraph article on Thursday, Mrs Braverman warned that the Prime Minister's new treaty and law declaring Rwanda a safe country would not enable the flights to take off for Rwanda before the general election. She branded it a ""tweaked version"" of the failed original Plan A rather than an effective Plan B.

Instead, she called for the new emergency legislation to block ""all avenues of legal challenge"" against the flights by excluding them from the ""entirety"" of European and human rights laws.

This would be coupled with amendments to the Rwanda agreement to answer the criticisms by the Supreme Court, which ruled the policy unlawful on Wednesday, new rules to deport migrants more quickly, tougher powers to detain illegal migrants and a commitment to deliver the legal changes by the Christmas recess.

""There is no longer any chance of stopping the boats within the current legal framework,"" said Mrs Braverman.

She was backed by Simon Clarke, the former levelling up secretary, who said the Government should be prepared to do ""whatever is required"" including disapplying the European Convention of Human Rights and domestic human rights legislation as well as the Refugee Convention to illegal migrants.

""It cannot be the case that our human rights framework effectively renders it undeliverable and effectively denies a sovereign parliament to do what the people want it to do,"" he said.

""It is an existential challenge to the credibility of our authority to make sure that we can stop what are tens of thousands of illegal entrants to this country.""","{'uri': 'telegraph.co.uk', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'The Telegraph'}","[{'uri': 'charles_hymas@telegraph.co.uk', 'name': 'Charles Hymas', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': False}]",https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/politics/2023/11/17/TELEMMGLPICT000336104062_17002394980650_trans_NvBQzQNjv4Bq04CEn9U-tFj9s1A1iKsTvm2hJm55QDgU5hOv7oY2Buc.jpeg?impolicy=logo-overlay,eng-9063836,-0.05098039215686279,25,25,The Telegraph,telegraph.co.uk

Menendez's Winston lawyers on Thursday asked a U.S. judge in Manhattan to let them withdraw from the criminal case. Paul Hastings said three partners, including veteran trial lawyer Robert Luskin, will represent Menendez.

Menendez, a New Jersey Democrat who was until recently chair of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, and his wife Nadine face a raft of corruption charges. They have pleaded not guilty.

Attorneys for Menendez did not give a reason for the switch. Representatives for Winston did not respond to requests for comment, and neither did a spokesperson for Menendez. Paul Hastings declined to comment other than confirming the defense team for Menendez.

U.S. District Judge Sidney Stein on Friday issued an order allowing Menendez's Winston lawyers to withdraw.

Chicago-founded Winston and Paul Hastings, which has headquarters in Los Angeles, are both large law firms known for their white-collar defense work, corporate litigation and other matters.

Luskin, a prominent Washington, D.C.-based Paul Hastings partner, is separately representing casino magnate Steve Wynn in a Justice Department lawsuit accusing him of failing to register as a foreign agent for China. Wynn defeated the lawsuit in the trial court, and the government has appealed.

In another matter, Luskin represents former Trump-era U.S. ambassador Gordon Sondland in a lawsuit to recoup legal fees related to his testimony at the first impeachment inquiry of then-President Donald Trump.

Luskin is working with Paul Hastings partners Avi Weitzman, co-leader of the complex litigation group at Paul Hastings, and Adam Fee.

Weitzman represents Hanoch ""Nuke"" Goldstein, a co-founder of bankrupt crypto lender Celsius in a lawsuit filed by the Federal Trade Commission.

Winston is home to veteran trial lawyer Abbe Lowell, who represented Menendez in a prior corruption case that ended in a mistrial in 2017.

Several media outlets reported in September that Lowell was representing Menendez in the new indictment. Lowell had not made any appearance in the case. He did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Lowell is defending President Joe Biden's son Hunter Biden on U.S. tax and firearm charges in Delaware federal court.

Nadine Menendez is represented by defense lawyers at the small Washington, D.C. firm Schertler Onorato Mead & Sears. Her defense lawyers declined to comment on Friday on Bob Menendez's move to hire new lawyers.

A trial in the case is set for May 2024 in Manhattan federal district court.

Kayatta, an appointee of Democratic former President Barack Obama, informed the White House in a letter made public on Friday that he plans to assume senior status following the confirmation of a successor.

Senior status is a form of semi-retirement for judges over the age of 65 who have completed at least 15 years on the federal bench. Presidents may name new full-time judges to fill those judges' seats.

""Assuming senior status will allow me to continue my own public service while also allowing a younger generation to have more of a voice in the court's work,"" Kayatta, 70, told Reuters in an email.

The new vacancy will give Biden a chance to name almost all of the judges on the six-member court. He has already appointed three judges--Gustavo Gelpí, Lara Montecalvo and Julie Rikelman--and in October nominated a fourth, Seth Aframe.

The sixth active member is Chief U.S. Circuit Judge David Barron, who like Kayatta is an appointee of Obama.

The 1st Circuit is the only of the 12 federal appeals courts whose active judges were all appointed by Democratic presidents. The lone Republican appointee when Biden took office, Jeffrey Howard, took senior status last year.

The court is the smallest of the circuit courts and hears cases from Maine, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Rhode Island and Puerto Rico.

Kayatta had been a partner at the law firm Pierce Atwood in Portland, Maine for more than 25 years when Obama first nominated to serve on the 1st Circuit in 2012. He won Senate confirmation in 2013.

He was part of the three-judge panel that in 2020 overturned Boston Marathon bomber Dzhokhar Tsarnaev's death sentence for his role in the 2013 attack that killed three people and wounded more than 260 others.

The U.S. Supreme Court in 2022 reversed that decision, but a 1st Circuit panel that Kayatta was also on appeared open during arguments in January to again overturning his death sentence on grounds the high court did not consider.

Last year, Kayatta wrote for a three-judge panel that grand jury records stemming from the investigation of the leak of the Pentagon Papers more than 50 years ago must remain secret despite any historical significance they might have.

He is also on the panel that in July heard Mexico's appeal of the dismissal of its $10 billion lawsuit seeking to hold U.S. gun manufacturers responsible for facilitating the trafficking of weapons to drug cartels across the U.S.-Mexico border.

Greg Abbott, the Texas governor, is expected to sign two right-wing immigration bills, setting off a likely constitutional battle over a new law that allows state and local police to arrest anyone suspected of crossing the Texas-Mexico border without documentation.

SB4, one of the harshest anti-immigration laws in US history, makes it a state crime to cross into Texas from another country without papers.

State judges are now required to order a migrant to return to the country they came from in lieu of prosecution. If the migrant refuses the judge's order, they could face a felony charge and up to 20 years in prison. SB4 also gives Texas officers the ability to arrest anyone who they believe has crossed into the state illegally, a power that immigrant advocates and Democrats have decried as racist.

""This is un-American,"" said Texas state representative Jolanda Jones, a Democrat. ""It will victimize people from the southern border, people of Latino descent.""

Jones told the Guardian that SB4 is ""state sanctioned"" racism against Latinos, noting that the new law does not contain a remedy for Americans who are wrongfully detained, arrested, or deported by sheriffs or state police.

""It will separate children from their parents,"" Jones said.

The controversial state law is the newest anti-immigration brainchild of Texas Republicans. In June,Abbott bussed migrants to Democratic-led cities without proper coordination. That same month, Texas launched Operation Lone Star, a multimillion-dollar initiative that has placed razor wire and thousands of troops at the Texas-Mexico border.

This week, the Republican governor is also slated to sign SB3, which allocates a whopping $1.5bn in tax dollars toward Texas border security measures. The high price tag of the new law ""includes paying for additional overtime expenses and costs"" of state troopers to patrol Colony Ridge, a housing development near Houston.

Colony Ridge became a focus of the Abbott administration after The Daily Wire, a far-right media outlet, called the development a ""magnet for illegal immigrants.""

Jones lambasted the new surge in border spending as fiscally irresponsible.

""This funding could and should be used to increase funding for public schools, public hospitals, neighborhood clinics, affordable housing, mental health facilities just to name a few,"" Jones told the Guardian.

Both anti-immigration laws have been widely criticized by Texas Democrats, but SB4 has also drawn condemnation from bipartisan legal groups and the Mexican government.

A group of more than two dozen former immigration judges signed a statement this week calling SB 4 unconstitutional. The signatories included judges who had been appointed by both Republican and Democratic administrations.

""Our personal politics may vary, but we dedicated our careers to the equal and fair administration of federal immigration law,"" the statement said, adding that SB4 should ""offend those who treasure our constitutional protections"".

Removing noncitizens from the US falls under the jurisdiction of the federal government. Immigration law is strictly the purview of the federal government, not individual states, in part because immigration is a major part of US foreign relations.

""Mexico in particular is a relationship that is important and central to how the federal government controls our border,"" said Emma Winger, deputy legal director of the American Immigration Council. ""What Texas is saying is that they are going to force people, many people who may not be Mexican citizens, to return to Mexico.""

In a statement released on 15 November, Mexico's secretary of foreign relations said the Mexican government ""categorically rejects"" SB4. Abbott's signature sets the stage for a standoff between Texas law enforcement officials and the federal government of Mexico.

Texas Republicans know that SB4 will likely invite legal challenges from either the Biden administration, immigration advocates, or both.

""Part of the reason for passing this law is to send a message to the Biden administration that Texas is going to go as far as it dares, and they don't care whether they lose in court, they're making a political statement,"" said Stephen Yale-Loehr, an immigration law professor at Cornell University.

Yale-Loehr said a legal challenge against SB4 would likely succeed, but court battles can take several years. In the meantime, Texas Republicans hope the threat of deportation will discourage migrants from crossing the southern border.

Immigration advocates like Yale-Loehr and Winger are especially concerned about the new law's interim effect on asylum seekers. Under federal law, all people who enter the United States have one year to apply for asylum, regardless of legal status. The new Texas statute means that undocumented immigrants in the process of applying for asylum could be deported from the United States, even if their case is still pending.

""These are people who have presented themselves to border patrol agents in hopes of getting legal protection here,"" Winger said. ""Texas is now saying that those people can be prosecuted, they can be jailed, and then they can be forcibly removed from the country.""","{'uri': 'theguardian.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","[{'uri': 'ava_sasani@theguardian.com', 'name': 'Ava Sasani', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': False}]",https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1917db324f8936d7cbce9ef21332d69d18beb016/0_0_5727_3436/master/5727.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&s=255017e5faad5297cd1a3468fa6a64d9,eng-9062380,-0.5137254901960784,25,25,The Guardian,theguardian.com

X, formerly Twitter, sued the Center for Countering Digital Hate in July, accusing it of trying to drive advertisers away through a ""scare campaign"" showing hate speech and other harmful content appeared to be overwhelming the platform.

According to the complaint, X lost tens of millions of dollars of ad revenue from ""false and misleading"" research reports that the center issued to create an ""ideological echo chamber"" for its preferred views.

This week, Musk, the world's richest person, sparked an outcry after endorsing as ""the actual truth"" an antisemitic post on X that falsely accused Jews of hating white people.

In a Thursday night filing in San Francisco federal court, the Center for Countering Digital Hate said X made up claims about how it gathered data from the platform, with each theory ""flimsier and more absurd than the last.""

The nonprofit also called the ""ridiculous"" and ""baseless"" lawsuit an attempt to silence others who say things X may not like. It also denied X's claim that commercial rivals and perhaps even foreign governments were funding its activities.

""X Corp's grievance is not that the CCDH defendants gathered public data in violation of obscure (and largely imagined) contract terms, but that they criticized X Corp (forcefully) to the public,"" the nonprofit said. ""Fortunately, state and federal free speech protections cannot be so easily evaded.""

A lawyer for X did not immediately respond on Friday to requests for comment.

Since buying Twitter for $44 billion in October 2022, Musk has faced much criticism for firing too many people who policed misinformation on the platform, and for allowing more harmful and abusive posts.

In September, X sued California to block the state from enforcing a law requiring that social media companies publish policies for policing misinformation, harassment, hate speech and extremism.

X said the law, Assembly Bill 587, violates its free speech rights. A federal judge will begin reviewing whether to enjoin the law in late November.

The case is X Corp v.

On Thursday, former Sgt. Kyle Gould pleaded guilty to charges of duty to report use of force and duty to intervene in his death in Clear Creek County Court.

On Friday, the Fifth Judicial District Attorney announced charges for six additional officers who were present on June 11, 2022 when Glass was shot and killed.

Georgetown Marshal Randy Williams has been charged with duty to intervene and 3rd degree assault; Georgetown Police Officer Timothy Collins, Idaho Springs Police Officer Brittany Morrow, Colorado State Trooper Ryan Bennie, and Division of Gaming Officers Christa Lloyd and Mary J. Harris have all been charged with duty to intervene. All charges are class 1 misdemeanors.

""Law enforcement officers must be held accountable for their actions when performing their trusted public service duties. Yesterday, my office filed additional charges against each of the six other officers who were present June 11, 2022, for failing to intervene in the events and actions of Andrew Buen, which led to Christian Glass' death,"" said Heidi McCollum, 5th Judicial District Attorney in a statement.

Glass, 22, was shot and killed in Colorado's high country in 2022 after he called 911 for help when his car broke down. It happened in Silver Plume and officers from several different law enforcement agencies responded. Glass told an emergency dispatcher he had two knives, a hammer and a rubber mallet. His family's attorney says that is because he was an amateur geologist.

Over the span of an hour, officers told him he needed to get out of his car and dismissed attempts to drop the weapons out of his window. Glass refused to leave the car, saying he was scared. As things escalated, officers broke a window in an attempt to get him out and Glass grabbed one of the knives. Officers then tased him. Body cam video then showed Glass beginning to swing the knife wildly with his arm. That's when an officer or officers shot him.

Gould was fired from the Clear Creek County Sheriff's Office a year ago after being indicted by a grand jury. As part of his plea deal, Gould agreed that he cannot serve as a police officer or security officer ever again in the state of Colorado.

While Gould's case has wrapped up, another former Clear Creek deputy, Andrew Buen, is fighting his charges of second-degree murder, official misconduct and reckless endangerment. He is scheduled to appear in court on Dec. 20 for a motions hearing in the case.","{'uri': 'cbsnews.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'CBS News'}",[],https://assets1.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2022/11/24/8ac413a5-4c35-44fe-a7f0-9a00c78d80ab/thumbnail/1200x630g4/41f84005fdc8ea8a0b6ee6304001d1a5/clear-creek-county-indictment-10-vo-transfer-frame-937.jpg?v=5659e73acd91751548aa89950cf015b0,eng-9069006,-0.4117647058823529,25,25,CBS News,cbsnews.com

Supreme Court judges have determined that financial groups cannot use a limitation defence in cases where they secretly charged a commission on PPI products.

Bank bosses had previously argued in the legal dispute that they should not have to pay back any secret commision money if it was taken more than six years ago. But top judges have ruled the timeframe is irrelevant if they deliberately concealed the commission charge.

The ruling comes after Azerbaijan in September retook the contested region of Nagorno-Karabakh in a lightning offensive, after decades of enmity between Baku and Yerevan. The military action prompted the mass exodus of most of its 120,000 ethnic Armenians to neighbouring Armenia.

Yerevan accused Azerbaijan of ethnic cleansing and asked the International Court of Justice, as the World Court is formally known, to issue emergency measures aimed at protecting the rights of ethnic Armenians from Nagorno-Karabakh.

""Azerbaijan must (...) ensure that persons who have left Nagorno-Karabakh after 19 September, 2023 and who wish to return to Nagorno-Karabakh are able to do so in a safe, unimpeded and expeditious manner"", presiding judge Joan Donoghue said.

The court said Azerbaijan must also make sure any ethnic Armenians still living in the enclave are ""free from the use of force or intimidation that may cause them to flee"" and ordered that Baku report to the court in two months to show what it is doing to comply with the order.

Representatives of Azerbaijan had already told the court in hearings in October that they would allow the return of residents who fled Nagorno-Karabakh and keep all inhabitants of the enclave safe.

The measures are part of two competing legal disputes between Armenia and Azerbaijan before the ICJ. Both states accuse each of violating a U.N. anti-discrimination treaty.

No date has been set for the main case and a final ruling is not expected before well into next year.

A group fighting against former President Donald Trump's legal challenges is pushing back with a digital video accusing those who have brought charges against him of abusing their legal power to obstruct his efforts to retake the White House.

It's the latest entry in a heated area that's only going to get more charged as Trump's criminal trials get started next year. Already, the former president has faced a gag order in his New York civil trial (which was temporarily lifted Thursday) preventing him from attacking court staff.

The 60-second digital spot from the Article III Project accuses ""activist"" judges and prosecutors of weaponizing the legal system for political gain. The video opens with a figure of Lady Justice, followed by a gavel and pair of handcuffs, and narration that says, ""Activist prosecutors and judges have destroyed the rule of law, the scales of justice forever broken and imbalanced. The worst offenders? Those who have weaponized the legal system for political gain against President Trump.""

It ticks through the cases against Trump in Georgia, New York, Washington, and Florida, singling out Fulton County, Georgia, District Attorney Fani Willis for ""using a witch hunt as a guise to arrest a former president and make him take a mugshot,"" and Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg of Manhattan for letting the city ""fall to pieces,"" while Judge Arthur Engoron ""laughed and smirked"" as Trump awaited trial.

""Even now they're resorting to insane legal theories to take him off the ballot,"" the ad continues. ""They've gone after a President of the United States. Do you think they'll stop there?""

It's a message that mirrors Trump's efforts to cast his legal woes as the work of a weaponized justice system that won't hesitate to turn on its political adversaries -- and a preview of what's to come next year.

Led by Mike Davis, Article III Project was founded in an effort to press for conservative judicial and other key nominees but evolved into an attack vector targeting Democratic nominations after Biden took office. It took a bare-knuckle approach to the confirmation of Supreme Court Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson over her sentencing record in child porn cases.

The former chief counsel for nominations to GOP Sen. Chuck Grassley, Davis has worked to confirm Justices Brett Kavanaugh and Neil Gorsuch, for whom he later clerked on the Supreme Court.

Davis has filled a messaging void to defend Trump that establishment Republican fixtures have largely avoided.

In a statement to NBC News, Davis said Trump's political opponents are using their legal powers to thwart the former president's reelection prospects, attacks that could upend our political system.

""These judges and prosecutors are leftwing partisan activists masquerading as public servants,"" Davis said. ""They've weaponized law enforcement and the judiciary to take out the leading candidate for President of the United States. Americans need to know what is happening in their country.""

A combative former Republican White House and Senate aide and cable news fixture, Davis has been at the forefront of the public defense of Trump since the FBI executed a search warrant at the former president's Mar-a-Lago residence in August 2022 to seize more than 100 classified documents he had previously been asked to return.

Davis has since argued against the indictments facing Trump in Georgia, Florida, Manhattan, and Washington, D.C., a New York civil fraud case, and the efforts underway in certain states to bar him from the ballot in 2024 under the 14th Amendment.","{'uri': 'nbcnews.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'NBC News'}",[],"https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_nbcnews-fp-1024-512,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2023-11/231117-donald-trump-mjf-1038-4110c5.jpg",,-0.2313725490196078,25,25,NBC News,nbcnews.com

Barely an hour after a gag order prohibiting Donald Trump from commenting about court staff at his civil fraud trial in New York was temporarily lifted, he was at it again - unleashing a blitzkrieg of social media outrage at a clerk who has become the lightning rod for the former president's rage.

On Thursday afternoon a New York appeals court judge, David Friedman, paused a gag order that had been placed on Trump last month. The move opened a window through which Trump could vent his unrestrained feelings.

The opportunity was seized upon almost immediately. An hour after the lifting of the gag order, one of Trump's inner circle, senior adviser Jason Miller, took to X, the social media site formerly known as Twitter.

""There's no way President Trump can receive a fair trial when Democrats are sending partisan attack dogs to do their dirty work,"" he said. Then he linked to a website devoted to attacking Allison Greenfield, the clerk who has been assisting the judge in the case, Arthur Engoron, at the $250m civil lawsuit trial in which the fate of the former president's New York-based family business, the Trump Organization, hangs.

The site labels Greenfield a ""Democrat operative and hack"" and accuses her of ""unethical partisan Democrat activities"". It also suggests that Engoron should be ""investigated and removed from the bench"".

Not long after that, Trump himself entered the fray. On his own social media platform, Truth Social, he attacked Greenfield as a ""politically biased and out of control, Trump-hating clerk"".

He also accused Engoron of driving businesses and jobs out of New York city, and derided Letitia James, the New York attorney general bringing the suit against him, as a ""worldwide disgrace"".

Trump is at trial in the civil lawsuit in New York over claims that the Trump Organization fraudulently inflated the value of its assets for financial benefit. Trump, his sons Eric and Don Jr, and other Trump Organization executives are all implicated. His daughter Ivanka is not a defendant but was required by the prosecution to give testimony as a witness. Donald Trump also took the stand in a dramatic appearance.

Engoron has already issued a pre-trial summary judgement finding Trump guilty of fraud and revoking his business license. Trump is appealing. The trial in Manhattan is to thrash out the details of the fraud.

Engoron imposed the gag order on Trump on 3 October after the former president posted a picture of Greenfield together with Chuck Schumer, the Democratic majority leader in the US senate, which had been drawn from her Instagram feed. Trump mocked the court clerk as ""Schumer's girlfriend"".

The judge said the gag order was necessary to protect his staff from threats. He said his chambers had receives hundreds of threatening phone calls, letters and packages. He did not impose a gag in relation to himself.

Trump has already been found to be in violation of the gag order, and was fined $15,000.

At an emergency hearing on Thursday, however, Friedman, sitting in New York state's intermediate appeals court, found that Trump's first amendment right to free speech was prime. He stayed the gag order.

Trump has faced similar restrictions on his speech imposed by a federal judge, Tanya Chutkan, in the criminal prosecution over his attempts to overturn the 2020 presidential election. That gag order has also been frozen by a federal appeals court.

On Wednesday, Trump filed a motion for a mistrial in the New York civil case. The motion accuses Engoron of ""bias"" and ""improper co-judging"" on the bench.","{'uri': 'theguardian.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","[{'uri': 'ed_pilkington@theguardian.com', 'name': 'Ed Pilkington', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': False}]",https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/398755f8ef26680f54f15705cb4f31016fc49f85/0_200_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&s=9f1cc4a2d6d81c71c40d9c2da15d3e78,eng-9065743,-0.2862745098039216,25,25,The Guardian,theguardian.com

A West African regional court on Friday dealt a severe blow to detained Senegalese opposition leader Ousmane Sonko's chances at running for president, with his political fate now resting with Senegal's Supreme Court.

In the latest twist of a long-running legal battle, the Economic Community of West African States court in Nigeria's capital Abuja said the ""state of Senegal did not violate any of (Sonko's) rights.""

Lawyers for Sonko -- who came third in the 2019 presidential election -- took his case to the ECOWAS court in order to challenge his removal from the electoral lists following his conviction in June.

The delisting made the 49-year-old firebrand politician ineligible to stand in Senegal's February 2024 presidential election.

The West African court ruling comes on the same day that Senegal's Supreme Court is due to rule on whether to reinstate Sonko on the electoral roll.

It is widely considered to be Sonko's last chance to contest the election.

""The ECOWAS Court of Justice gives (Senegalese President) Macky Sall the go-ahead to destroy his opponent,"" Juan Branco, one of Sonko's lawyers, said on social media.

The hearing in Senegal's capital Dakar opened early Friday under a heavy police presence, an AFP journalist saw.

Lawyers from both camps as well as opposition activists were present in the courtroom as the hearing continued around midday.

- Call to 'resist' -

Sonko, a political thorn in Sall's side, has faced a series of legal woes over the past two and a half years.

His conviction in a moral corruption case in June triggered the deadliest clashes the West African nation had seen in years.

He and his lawyers say the court cases are part of a plot to torpedo his political career.

He is popular among the under-20-year-olds, who make up half the population, for his pan-Africanist rhetoric and tough stance on former colonial power, France.

Late on Thursday, Sonko called on people in the country to ""resist"", claiming the ""nation's destiny"" was at stake.

""We must stand up for fair, free and independent justice, for the right to live in a country without fear of being arrested and imprisoned without justification,"" he declared on social media.

Dakar remained calm on Friday morning.

The interior ministry has refused to issue Sonko the necessary sponsorship forms for his candidacy.

Sonko was on June 1 convicted in absentia of morally corrupting a young person and sentenced to two years in prison.

He was arrested in late July and detained on other charges, including fomenting insurrection, criminally associating with a terrorist body and endangering state security.

He has periodically been on hunger strike since then.","{'uri': 'dailymail.co.uk', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'Daily Mail Online'}",[],https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2023/11/17/14/wire-77932147-1700231037-117_636x382.jpg,eng-9071087,0.1450980392156862,25,25,Daily Mail Online,dailymail.co.uk

Downing Street has ruled out a proposal by rightwing Conservatives to override international law to remove asylum seekers to Rwanda, an idea condemned by a senior centrist Tory as ""dictatorial"".

Rishi Sunak has already pledged to introduce emergency legislation to try to get around Wednesday's supreme court ruling that flights to Rwanda could not take place because of the risk that people could be wrongly returned to their home countries and placed in danger.

With the bill not set to be published until the week after next, Sunak has come under intense pressure to use so-called notwithstanding clauses, a legal mechanism which would state the government could ignore the European convention on human rights (ECHR) and elements of the UN refugee convention placed into UK law.

After Suella Braverman, sacked by Sunak as home secretary on Monday, used a newspaper article to urge the prime minister to take this approach, a former deputy prime minister said this would betray the party's fundamental principles.

""This is the most unconservative proposal I've ever heard,"" Damian Green, who was deputy PM under Theresa May, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. ""You know conservatives believe in a democratic country, run by the rule of law. Dictators like Xi [Jinping] and [Vladimir] Putin would prefer to have the state completely untrammelled by any law.""

Green added: ""Defending the principle that governments have to obey the law is really important for conservatives, perhaps particularly at times of heightened political change.""

Asked if No 10 might consider setting aside the remit of the ECHR and refugee convention, Sunak's spokesperson said this risked seeing the bill mired in delays.

""The right approach is to have a targeted, focused response to the issues that were raised by the supreme court,"" she said. ""Obviously, we have been working and preparing for outcomes for some time, and will now finalise legislation in the light of the specific judgment on Wednesday, but we think that it's right to take this targeted approach, and that is the swiftest way to get flights off the ground.

""We're mindful that a broader, more complex approach does come with the potential for this to take longer. Our priority is stopping the boats and getting the Rwanda partnership up and running and flights off the ground, and we think that our targeted approach, which responds specifically to the issues raised by the supreme court, is the swiftest way to achieve that.""

Braverman's article in the Daily Telegraph set out a five-point plan she argued would make sure flights would leave by spring, Sunak's target, and help reduce the numbers of asylum seekers arriving unofficially in the UK on small boats across the Channel.

As well as using notwithstanding clauses in the law, she said the UK should work more closely with Rwanda to guarantee the treatment of asylum seekers, that those who arrive on boats should be detained and deported within days, and finally that parliament should sit over Christmas to pass the new laws.

Sunak's spokesperson did not rule out MPs sitting over Christmas, while stressing this was a matter for Commons authorities: ""We're prepared to do whatever is necessary to ensure that we can get this in place and get flights off the ground.""

Sir David Normington, a former permanent secretary at the Home Office, said Braverman's latest ideas on how to revive the Rwanda plan were unworkable.

""One of the things we keep hearing, and this is Suella Braverman's latest idea, is that we should remove all appeals, that we should close off all routes,"" he said on Friday. ""I really don't think that that is possible. I think in the end, the supreme court wouldn't allow that.""

Following controversy over a description of sleeping rough as a ""lifestyle choice"", and a public row with the Metropolitan police over pro-Gaza ceasefire protests, Braverman was finally sacked for writing a newspaper article not authorised by No 10.

She has continued to cause problems for Sunak, writing a public letter accusing him of being weak and reneging on promises he made to her during his leadership campaign.","{'uri': 'theguardian.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","[{'uri': 'peter_walker@theguardian.com', 'name': 'Peter Walker', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': False}, {'uri': 'kiran_stacey@theguardian.com', 'name': 'Kiran Stacey', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': False}]",https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/840296c4e22de26778846088d42ee70dcb06fa80/7_58_2513_1508/master/2513.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&s=96641c3808011c23b62e5e6d224cc2b8,eng-9063836,-0.2627450980392156,25,25,The Guardian,theguardian.com

Alison Battisson, the director of Human Rights For All, and David Manne, the executive director of Refugee Legal, have both warned the changes may amount to ""extrajudicial"" punishment.

On Thursday parliament passed a bill imposing conditions, including electronic monitoring and curfews, to bridging visas issued to those who are required to be released due to the high court's ruling on indefinite detention. It creates criminal penalties for their breach, including a mandatory minimum sentence of one year in prison, with each day of breach considered a separate offence.

Battisson, who acts for people in detention and was one of the first to demand her clients be released as a result of the high court decision, said there are ""definite concerns"" with the new regime.

""There would appear prima facie grounds to challenge because the conditions are disproportionate to any risk,"" she told Guardian Australia.

'They are unnecessary because the criminal justice system has all those checks and balances,"" she said, citing risk assessments conducted at sentencing and parole.

""Extrajudicial punishment is likely unconstitutional. I'm very confident someone will bring claim.

""It's so obviously challengeable,"" she said. ""That's why they should've waited for the high court's full reasons - you don't rush through legislation like this.""

Manne said the new laws ""impose such severe restrictions on fundamental rights and liberties that you cannot rule out the possibility of a future legal challenges"". ""There is every chance.""

He said the laws create ""extraordinary extrajudicial powers akin to anti-terrorism control orders to, in effect, further deprive people of their liberty when the high court have just ruled against deprivation of their liberty"".

""What we're seeing here is serious government overreach - [legislating] powers that would ordinarily only be determined by a court.""

The Human Rights Law Centre's acting legal director, Sanmati Verma, suggested while challenges ""are available"" they may be practically difficult for the cohort of 84 people released from detention so far.

""The people who might have been able to bring one are so thoroughly demonised, it is difficult to see how a challenge could be immediately brought,"" she said. ""Nevertheless, there are serious legal problems with the legislation and regulations.""

In Senate debate on Thursday, Labor's Murray Watt rejected the Greens contention that the conditions amounted to imprisonment because the bill states curfews can only be eight hours at a time.

Watt acknowledged Coalition amendments, accepted by the government, ""add constitutional risk"". He said the government believes they are lawful, but there may need to be ""adjustments"" after the high court's reasons.

On Friday the shadow home affairs minister, James Paterson, revealed that despite Labor agreeing in principle to mandatory electronic monitoring and curfews, this had been watered down to a strong presumption for those conditions.

Paterson told Sky News the government had received legal advice if these were ""mandatory, that might fall foul of the high court's decision, it might be akin to punishment"".

The legislation now states those conditions ""must be imposed unless the minister is satisfied that the holder does not pose a risk to the community"".

Paterson said this is a ""high bar"" and the Coalition expects ""all"" or ""almost all"" the cohort would therefore have electronic monitoring.

The top health official in one of Michigan's largest counties is asking a judge to uphold a $4 million settlement in exchange for her resignation, coming after months of conflict with local conservative leaders who were elected in response to COVID-19 restrictions.

Ottawa County leaders had attempted to fire Adeline Hambley in January after they took majority control of the county's board of commissioners. Finding themselves unable to, the board opted to offer her $4 million -- equivalent to a quarter of the health department's 2024 budget -- in return for her resignation. She also would have had to drop her lawsuit against the county.

The board backed off the offer, saying it was only a ""tentative settlement agreement."" David Kallman, the county's legal counsel, told The Associated Press that ""there has never been an agreement by the board to accept the $4 million. There were discussions.""

MICHIGAN PROPERTY OWNERS NOTCH CRUCIAL LEGAL WIN IN DAM COLLAPSE CASE

But Hambley's lawyer filed a motion Thursday to enforce the settlement, and it's scheduled to go in front of a judge on Nov. 27.

""The parties agreed to settle this matter on Nov. 6, 2023. Now, defendants have remorse and want out of the deal,"" Hambley's lawyer, Sarah Riley-Howard, wrote in the filing.

Public health officials and local health departments across the country became political targets during the pandemic due to lockdowns and restrictions.

Ottawa County's health department serves 300,000 residents in the western part of the state. Earlier this year, county commissioners voted to cut the department's upcoming budget by nearly $4 million. The board had threatened deeper cuts, and Hambley took to social media to protest.

The county's 11-member board of commissioners was transformed last year when eight incumbents were defeated by a slate of challengers tied closely to a group known as Ottawa Impact, which was formed in 2021 partly in response to mask mandates in the county.

Kyle Terpstra, a Republican commissioner, resigned from his position on the board Thursday, just hours after the Hambley lawsuit was filed. He said ""significant changes in my personal and professional life"" led to the resignation.

Hambley sued the commissioners earlier this year for ""termination in violation of public policy."" In October, the state's appeals court ruled Hambley could be fired only for ""just cause.""

But following a nearly eight-hour closed session at a Nov. 6 meeting, commissioners voted to ""accept counsel's recommendation regarding litigation and settlement activities"" regarding Hambley. The settlement was later revealed to be $4 million, in return for Hambley's resignation.

Hambley would work until at least Nov. 30 but no later than Dec. 15 under the agreement.

Nathaniel Kelly, a safety manager at an HVAC company and who has no public health experience, is in line to take over the county health department.

The county requested approval from the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services for Kelly to serve as acting health officer, but the state told the county it couldn't appoint a health officer until a vacancy exists, according to a spokesperson with the department.","{'uri': 'foxnews.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'Fox News'}",[],https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2023/11/Adeline-Hambley-Michigan.gif,eng-9069117,-0.04313725490196074,25,25,Fox News,foxnews.com

Please try again later{{ /verifyErrors }}

Rishi Sunak has denied ""tinkering"" with the Rwanda policy after his sacked former home secretary suggested his plan to save the scheme would fail without more radical measures.

The Prime Minister defended his announcement of emergency legislation and a new treaty with Kigali in a bid to address issues that led the UK's highest court to rule the deal was unlawful.

Speaking to broadcasters during a visit to a school in Bolsover, Mr Sunak insisted he will ""work night and day"" to ensure domestic courts cannot ""systemically"" block flights to the east African nation.

It comes after Suella Braverman, who was ousted during a Cabinet reshuffle this week, claimed the Prime Minister's ""Plan B"" is ""simply a tweaked version of the failed Plan A"".

Asked whether his rescue measures amounted to ""tinkering with plan A... (without) a serious alternative"", he said: ""No, as I said, the progress we've made this year on tackling this issue is meaningful.

""The number of crossings are down by a third this year, because we're co-operating with other countries to crack down on the criminal gangs.""

He added: ""We can pass these laws in Parliament that will give us the powers and the tools we need. Then we can get the flights off and whether it's the House of Lords or the Labour Party standing in our way I will take them on because I want to get this thing done and I want to stop the boats.""

Mr Sunak declined to say whether he would call a general election if the upper chamber blocked the new law, instead insisting it was up to Labour to help it reach the statute books quickly.

""The real question is: is the Labour Party going to stand in the way and stop this from happening, or are they going to work with us and support this Bill so we can get it through as quickly as possible?"" he said.

Sir Keir Starmer later accused the Government of opting to ""blame somebody else for their failure"" as he demanded ministers ""stop pursuing the expensive gimmicks that are just wasting time.""

In a scathing article on Friday, Mrs Braverman claimed a solution to the challenge of stopping migrants crossing the English Channel ""demands of the Government an end to self-deception and spin"".

""Tinkering with a failed plan will not stop the boats,"" she wrote in the Daily Telegraph.

Mr Sunak is facing concerns over the dilemma from both sides of his party, with one-nation Tory Damian Green defending the PM against Mrs Braverman's attack but stressing the importance of observing the rule of law.

""It's not just all our own laws passed by Parliament, and all international treaties that we have signed, that Suella wants to sweep away,"" Mr Green told BBC Radio 4's Today programme.

""Conservatives believe in a democratic country run by the rule of law. And dictators, Xi and Putin, would prefer to have the state completely untrammelled by any law. And so, as a democrat I oppose it.

""But quite specifically as a Conservative, because if we Conservatives don't believe that the state should be controlled by the law, that the Government has to obey the law as much as you or I have to obey the law, then that seems to me to be very profoundly unconservative.""

Meanwhile, Lord Sumption, a former Supreme Court judge, told the BBC the plan to use a law to declare Rwanda as safe was ""profoundly discreditable"", ""constitutionally really quite extraordinary"", and would ""effectively overrule"" a decision by the UK's highest court.

Mr Sunak's two-pronged strategy to dealing with the Supreme Court judgment is to announce an emergency law that he says will enable Parliament to ""unequivocally"" declare Rwanda a safe destination for asylum seekers.

He will also publish an upgraded agreement with the country which is expected to attempt to address the court's concerns around refoulement - the potential for refugees whose applications for asylum are rejected by Kigali to be sent back to the country they are fleeing.

Downing Street did not rule out the prospect of MPs debating the legislation over Christmas after Mrs Braverman suggested Parliament should sit through the festive period to push through the laws.

""I think we are prepared to do whatever is necessary to ensure that we can get this in place and get flights off the ground,"" a No 10 spokeswoman said.

Meanwhile, No 10 has promised the treaty will published in ""the coming days"", but said it could not confirm reports that this will be as soon as Monday.","{'uri': 'independent.co.uk', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'The Independent'}",[],https://static.independent.co.uk/2023/11/17/12/6cbd5874f3f2b8dcadd805921642da2bY29udGVudHNlYXJjaGFwaSwxNzAwMzA3MDA4-2.74574836.jpg?quality=75&width=1200&auto=webp,eng-9063836,-0.01960784313725494,25,25,The Independent,independent.co.uk

What international law says,"Israel's attacks on Gaza's al-Shifa hospital have sparked accusations of war crimes. Israel denies this, saying its operation falls within the boundaries of international law

The Geneva conventions, adopted in the aftermath of the second world war, form the core of international humanitarian law and ""are particularly protective of civilian hospitals"", according to Mathilde Philip-Gay, an expert in international humanitarian law at Lyon 3 University in south-east France.

She said: ""It is forbidden to turn recognised civilian hospitals into a conflict zone. It is also forbidden to use civilian populations, the sick or the injured as human shields, it is a war crime, as is fighting from inside a hospital.""

Article 8 of the Rome statute, which established the international criminal court (ICC) in The Hague, defines a long list of war crimes including ""intentionally directing attacks against buildings dedicated to religion, education, art, science or charitable purposes, historic monuments, hospitals and places where the sick and wounded are collected"".

But it makes an exception if the targets are ""military objectives"". Philip-Gay said that ""if a civilian hospital is used for acts harmful to the enemy, that is the legal term used"", the hospital can lose its protected status under international law and be considered a legitimate target. Nevertheless, if there is doubt as to whether a hospital is a military objective or being used for acts harmful to the enemy, the presumption, under international humanitarian law, is that it is not.

It is widely accepted that Hamas has an extensive tunnel network across Gaza.

Israel is not a member of the ICC, but the ICC says it has jurisdiction in Gaza and the West Bank because Palestine is a state party to the court, a claim disputed by Israel.

Karim Khan, the chief prosecutor at the ICC, wrote in the Guardian: ""For those responsible for targeting and firing missiles, I wish to be clear on three points in particular. One: in relation to every dwelling house, in relation to any school, any hospital, any church, any mosque - those places are protected, unless the protective status has been lost because they are being used for military purposes. Two: if there is a doubt that a civilian object has lost its protective status, the attacker must assume that it is protected. Three: the burden of demonstrating that this protective status is lost rests with those who fire the gun, the missile, or the rocket in question.

""In this context, I would also underline that the indiscriminate firing of rockets from Gaza into Israel may represent breaches of international humanitarian law subject to the jurisdiction of the ICC.""

The United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (UNOCHA), says: ""Any military operation around or within hospitals must take steps to spare and protect the patients, medical staff, and other civilians. All feasible precautions must be taken, including effective warnings, which consider the ability of patients, medical staff, and other civilians to evacuate safely.""

Philip-Gay said: ""The other party must take all precautions to avoid intentionally targeting civilians."" Even if the hospital is used for ""acts harmful to the enemy"", Philip-Gay said, the other party ""does not have the right to bombard it for two days and completely destroy it"", citing the need under international law for the response to be ""proportionate"".

She added that the other party must give advance warning of its response and that evacuation procedures must be put in place for patients and health workers.

Alternatively, they can be asked ""to isolate themselves in a part of the hospital"", she said. But during any military operation against the site, ""there have to be doctors to take care of the patients"", she said.","{'uri': 'theguardian.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'The Guardian'}",[],https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c6242615f68b6fdf534205ab06c20bb9a6581a1e/0_194_5808_3485/master/5808.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&s=b0282fa4a8b0ece3b693bb1eb3ea59db,eng-9070708,-0.6470588235294117,25,25,The Guardian,theguardian.com

A little over a year ago, when she was home secretary in Liz Truss' government, she made it perfectly clear that she thought this central aspect of government policy was incompatible with UK membership of the European Convention on Human Rights. Right or wrong, she was correct and logically consistent.

She said then ""My position personally is that ultimately we do need to leave the European Convention on Human Rights...I don't think we need to be subject to an institution born out of the post-war era which is a bit analogue in the way that it operates, which has centralised power, which is distant and which is politicised, which is pursuing an agenda which is at odds with our politics and our values. I don't think that's the direction that the world is going in, that's not the direction that people called for with Brexit.""

She herself admitted that her personal view wasn't government policy, and she was criticised for breaching cabinet collective responsibility.

Now, although freed from cabinet collective responsibility, Braverman hardly mentions the ECHR in her latest contribution to the debate. In fact, and rather bizarrely, out of government she seems to have moved closer to the official government line than where she was when she was still in the cabinet. Even more curious, not to say unfortunate, is that her article acknowledges that the ECHR can still intervene in refugee deportation cases in the UK. Braverman admits that: ""Even if we won in the domestic court, the saga would simply relocate to Strasbourg where the European court would take its time deciding if it liked our laws.""

So her answer to that is to pass emergency legislation that suspends all application of any British or international law and the English common law, including the ancient doctrine of habeas corpus, simply to send a handful of people to Kigali. Yet if you want to evade international law it would be much better and simpler, as she said before, to opt out of the European and United Nations conventions, rather than trying to make being unlawful lawful, suspending our civil rights and placing the British courts under the control of government.

In the latest Braverman plan, virtually any decision by the Home Office - which in effect means by the home secretary and other ministers - could never be challenged by the courts for its legality. Passing such ""emergency legislation"" would set the terrible precedent of placing politicians - albeit elected and democratically accountable - above the law.

MPs could ask questions and pursue constituents' complaints, but if a minister chose to ignore them, then they could. This is supposed to be limited to ""illegal"" refugees, but who is to say who is a legal or illegal refugee? And who is to stop government passing more laws than exempt politicians from the irksome business to obeying the law?

It is a monstrous idea, even by her own authoritarian standards, but it is also unworkable in the sense that the UK would still be a member of the European and UN conventions, and subject to adverse rulings and possible international sanctions as a result of its drift to a form of light dictatorship - an elected dictatorship, but one where arbitrary decisions by bureaucrats and politicians in power cannot be challenged and tested by citizens via independent courts.

The UK has only ever suspended human rights partially and temporarily in times of wars of survival. The small boats crisis is not an invasion, and the Rwanda plan can only cope with a few hundred anyway - which makes the focus on it absurdly disproportionate. Braverman wants to suspend the rule of law during peacetime and on a permanent basis. Unfortunately, Rishi Sunak seems to want to do much the same thing; he differs only on the extent to which he wants to set himself above the law. We should be clear about how close his actual policy is to Braverman's, even though he fired her.

Of course, none of this will happen now because we are far too near to a general election the government is bound to lose, and these unconstitutional ideas - with no manifesto-based electoral mandate - can and will be challenged in the House of Lords and indeed the courts, while they are still capable of doing so. The European Court of Human Rights (which is not ""the European court"" of the EU, as Braverman sneakily implies) would intervene - ironically demonstrating precisely why we need it.

The danger to liberty remains, however. Imagine a world where, in four or five years' time, Braverman is leader of the opposition and slips some slyly worded commitment into a Conservative manifesto about making decisions by ministers unchallengeable in a court of law, here or abroad.

Braverman's ""National Conservatives"", or Nat Cs, under the vagaries of our electoral system, could claim a mandate on 35 per cent of the vote for placing the judiciary (""lefty lawyers"") under the direct ""democratic"" control of ministers. Permanently. No more ""enemies of the people"". No more judicial reviews. That's how dangerous Braverman is, and that's why she, and those like her, must be kept as far away as possible from power: they don't know how to use it.","{'uri': 'independent.co.uk', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'The Independent'}",[],https://static.independent.co.uk/2023/11/14/17/57a1a0876a20e6ea7017ede2a577ec5fY29udGVudHNlYXJjaGFwaSwxNzAwMDY5OTU5-2.74210096.jpg?quality=75&width=1200&auto=webp,,0.05098039215686279,25,25,The Independent,independent.co.uk

Mr Sunak is facing concerns over the dilemma from both sides of his party, with one-nation Tory Damian Green defending the PM against Mrs Braverman's attack but stressing the importance of observing the rule of law.

""It's not just all our own laws passed by Parliament, and all international treaties that we have signed, that Suella wants to sweep away,"" Mr Green told BBC Radio 4's Today programme.

""Conservatives believe in a democratic country run by the rule of law. And dictators, Xi and Putin, would prefer to have the state completely untrammelled by any law. And so, as a democrat I oppose it.

""But quite specifically as a Conservative, because if we Conservatives don't believe that the state should be controlled by the law, that the Government has to obey the law as much as you or I have to obey the law, then that seems to me to be very profoundly unconservative.""

Meanwhile, Lord Sumption, a former Supreme Court judge, told the BBC the plan to use a law to declare Rwanda as safe was ""profoundly discreditable"", ""constitutionally really quite extraordinary"", and would ""effectively overrule"" a decision by the UK's highest court.

Mr Sunak's two-pronged strategy to dealing with the Supreme Court judgment is to announce an emergency law that he says will enable Parliament to ""unequivocally"" declare Rwanda a safe destination for asylum seekers.

He will also publish an upgraded agreement with the country which is expected to attempt to address the court's concerns around refoulement - the potential for refugees whose applications for asylum are rejected by Kigali to be sent back to the country they are fleeing.

A Government source said the treaty with Rwanda would be published ""shortly"" but perhaps not as soon as Monday, as reports earlier suggested.","{'uri': 'independent.co.uk', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'The Independent'}",[],https://static.independent.co.uk/2023/11/17/12/6cbd5874f3f2b8dcadd805921642da2bY29udGVudHNlYXJjaGFwaSwxNzAwMzA3MDA4-2.74574836.jpg?quality=75&width=1200&auto=webp,eng-9063836,0.02745098039215677,25,25,The Independent,independent.co.uk

Republicans are scheming to undo it,"Twenty-seven GOP members emphasized in a letter after the 7 November vote they would work to prevent its implementation

Ohio voters overwhelmingly approved a constitutional amendment on 7 November, guaranteeing its citizens the right to abortion access, but a group of rightwing Republican lawmakers is already trying to reverse that result.

The referendum, which Ohioans passed by 57% of votes, established a constitutional right to an abortion, overriding laws passed by the Republican-dominated legislature to dramatically restrict access. In response, 27 GOP members of the Ohio general assembly signed a statement the next day arguing the abortion rights proposal ""failed to mention a single, specific law"", and vowing to ""do everything in [their] power"" to prevent the restrictive abortion laws on the books in Ohio from being challenged.

Four of them went even further, circulating draft legislation to give the legislature ""exclusive authority over implementing"" the constitutional amendment at the exclusion of the courts - a move legal experts have decried as unconstitutional.

""To prevent mischief by pro-abortion courts,"" wrote the four Republican lawmakers in a statement, ""Ohio legislators will consider removing jurisdiction from the judiciary over this ambiguous ballot initiative.""

The move is the latest attempt by some Republicans in the state to use their iron grip on the state legislature to push anti-democratic efforts. The legislature has for years declined to heed a 2015 ballot measure prohibiting partisan gerrymandering and attempted in August to make it harder for voters to directly affect policy through referendums. The latest move goes much further, essentially challenging the authority of the courts and the constitution.

The draft legislation, however, has been rejected even by high-ranking Republicans: the house speaker, Jason Stephens, called it a non-starter and a clear violation of the basic democratic principle of separation of powers. ""This is Schoolhouse Rock-type stuff. We need to make sure that we have the three branches of the government,"" he told reporters on Tuesday.

Mike DeWine, the Republican Ohio governor, also expressed doubts about the bill's chances. ""I don't think the public should start thinking that it is going to become law,"" DeWine said on Monday.

Matt Huffman, the state senate majority leader, who vocally opposed the abortion rights amendment, has yet to weigh in. But he has already floated another alternative: holding another referendum on abortion access to undo the recent decision. Huffman is term-limited and it's widely expected he will run for a seat in the state house of representatives. There's been buzz locally that if he wins, Huffman could challenge Stephens for the speakership. Huffman did not respond to a request for comment.

But just because the Republican proposal isn't likely to be adopted doesn't make it irrelevant. Voting rights advocates and political observers see it as just the latest effort to undermine democracy and cement rightwing policies, even if they're at odds with the majority of Ohio's voters.

""The threat of election subversion is just as powerful as subversion itself, because it erodes trust and makes people question whether or not they want to participate - whether or not their vote will be counted, [and] whether after it's counted, if it will actually be respected,"" said Kayla Griffin, the Ohio state director of the voting rights group All Voting Is Local.

State Republicans ignored a 2015 referendum prohibiting partisan gerrymandering and drew maps that gave Republicans an advantage in both branches of the legislature - they have a supermajority in each - and a lopsided number of congressional seats.

The conservative-leaning state supreme court ruled seven times that the maps violated the constitution, and after every ruling the legislature returned maps to the court without meaningfully changing them. The swing vote on the court retired at the end of 2022, leaving behind a court that will likely side with the GOP and let them preserve their supermajorities in the legislature.

Those maps have given them immense power to do whatever they want with state laws, even if they're unpopular with majorities of Ohioans.

""There is a disconnect between what voters want and what the legislature wants,"" said Catherine Turcer, executive director of Common Cause Ohio. ""It just highlights how gerrymandered the state legislature is.""

This summer, Republicans also tried to weaken the one check voters have on their power by making it dramatically harder to pass a statewide constitutional amendment - specifically targeting the abortion initiative in November. The proposal would have raised the threshold to pass citizen-led ballot measures from a simple majority to 60%. Voters rejected it by a wide margin in August.

Frank LaRose, the Republican secretary of state, who opposed the abortion amendment, then rewrote the ballot language for the November election to include the term ""unborn child"", rather than ""fetus"", a move that opponents criticized as trying to unduly sway voters.

The latest threats by the right wing of the state GOP to suppress the implementation of the constitutional amendment are a marked escalation in that effort.

If Republicans in the state legislature were to pass their proposed legislation challenging the authority of the courts to interpret the constitution, the issue would almost certainly end up disputed in court.

""It really represents an attempt to interfere with the judicial branch,"" said Steven Steinglass, dean emeritus of the Cleveland State University College of Law and the author of The Ohio State Constitution: A Reference Guide. ""It violates the Ohio principles of separation of powers.""

The latest proposal appears too much even for the state's leading Republicans. But it shows how far some elected officials are willing to go to try to force their views on their state - even when it's clear that large majorities of Ohioans disagree.

""This is certainly coming from a far-right faction of the Republican caucus. That said, this faction has gained more and more power,"" said the Ohio Democratic house minority leader, Allison Russo. ""It just speaks to how this body has become more and more extreme.""","{'uri': 'theguardian.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","[{'uri': 'alice_herman@theguardian.com', 'name': 'Alice Herman', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': False}]",https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/71328833ae81ab9321d44d4b9a47677de3b02568/0_232_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&s=56e04bc230373ea23e3e1c7f067cfedb,eng-9064475,-0.1843137254901961,25,25,The Guardian,theguardian.com

Prosecutors said in a filing they were dropping their case against Ara Aprahamian, who had pleaded not guilty in Philadelphia federal court to charges including price-fixing and bid-rigging.

""Dismissal of this case is not contrary to manifest public interest, and it will allow the conservation of this court's time and resources,"" prosecutors said.

They did not explain why the government was dropping the case, which was still in the evidence collection and sharing stage.

The Justice Department declined to comment. A lawyer for Aprahamian, Bob Gage, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Taro in July 2020 agreed to pay more than $200 million to resolve criminal price-fixing allegations amid a broad crackdown by the Justice Department on alleged pricing abuses in the generic drug market.

Taro is now owned by India's Sun Pharmaceutical Industries. A spokesperson for Sun on Thursday did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

In 2020, a former executive of Novartis unit Sandoz, Hector Armando Kellum, pleaded guilty to participating in a scheme to fix prices for generic medicines.

Prosecutors in that case had alleged Aprahamian was one of Kellum's co-conspirators. Kellum agreed to cooperate, prosecutors said.

Kellum's sentencing is set for April 30, 2024, in U.S. District Judge R. Barclay Surrick's court. Attorneys for Kellum did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Thursday.

The case is United States v. Ara Aprahamian, U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania, 2:20-cr-00064-RBS.

Two years later, the case remains open","When Adrian Abelar was shot in the back while face-down on the pavement at a Rosemead auto body shop in October 2021, the consequences were swift for everyone but the L.A. County sheriff's deputy who pulled the trigger.

Abelar, 27, suffered multiple fractured vertebrae and woke up in a hospital bed, court records show. The bullet narrowly missed his spine, according to his lawyer, who said he could have easily been paralyzed or killed.

The shop owner, Richard Doktor, says his business suffered after the sheriff's department released information that made it clear he was the person who called police. The word ""Rat"" can be seen etched in graffiti on the sidewalk outside his shop. Doktor says he's received so many threatening phone calls that employees have quit.

But more than two years later, the question of what, if anything, will happen to Deputy Yen Liu remains unanswered.

The sheriff's department turned over its investigation to L.A. County prosecutors earlier this month. Two officials inside the district attorney's office, who requested anonymity because the case remains open and they are not authorized to discuss it with the media, described the sheriff's probe as taking an unusually long time.

Some officials, the sources said, became concerned when Abelar's civil attorney, Thomas Beck, alerted them to the facts of the case in mid-October and they learned it had yet to be presented for potential prosecution. The office has increasingly filed charges against police officers accused of using excessive force since Dist. Atty. George Gascón took over in 2020.

Liu's case appears to be one of the lengthiest deputy shooting investigations in recent sheriff's department history, according to county records. Since 2013, there were only four other cases in which more than two years elapsed between the shooting and the district attorney's office determining whether charges were warranted, according to a 2021 report by the L.A. County Office of the Inspector General. Such delays, the report said, reduce the chances of a successful prosecution.

""Memories fade and are influenced by exposure to other information,"" the report said. ""Deputies and witnesses inevitably have discussed the details of an event with their colleagues, friends and family, union representatives, attorneys and counselors which affects their memories and perceptions of the events.""

A spokeswoman for the district attorney's office declined to comment.

Sheriff's Dept. Homicide Lt. Michael Gomez said such incidents take time to investigate. ""We have been in communication with the D.A.'s Office throughout the case,"" he said in an email to The Times. ""Our primary objective is to always conduct a thorough and comprehensive investigation to ensure all facts are presented.""

Calls and emails seeking comment from a civil attorney representing Liu were not returned.

Beyond the slow pace of the investigation, the shooting has drawn concerns from use-of-force experts, who question whether it was justified. While Liu's body-worn camera fell off before the bullet was fired, footage captured by another deputy's device clearly shows Abelar unarmed and lying flat on his stomach when Liu fires a single shot into his back at point-blank range.

""The guy clearly does not have a weapon in his hand and the deputy who is on top of him draws his firearm, jams it in the guy's back and fires it immediately upon contact,"" said Ed Obayashi, a lawyer and former Plumas County sheriff's deputy who advises departments throughout California about use-of-force incidents.

In a recent interview, Abelar said he didn't know why sheriff's deputies were approaching his car at J&R Auto on the day of the shooting in 2021. But he knew he was in trouble as soon as he saw badges. Abelar -- who has multiple prior arrests for domestic violence, making threats and weapons offenses -- had failed to check in with his probation officer, and there was a gun in his waistband.

He said he knew it was wrong to be carrying a gun, but he felt he needed to protect himself and his friends.

""I had a lot of people looking for me,"" Abelar said, declining to offer specifics.

The deputies were responding to a call from Doktor, who had claimed Abelar arrived demanding repairs be done on his car quickly because he had an active murder warrant, according to the sheriff's department. No such warrant existed.

Video of the incident released by the sheriff's department shows Abelar having a calm conversation with the responding deputies, during which he lied about being on probation. After a few minutes, Abelar said, he made the decision to run, fearing if the deputies found him with a gun, he'd either go back to prison or they would shoot him. He says he tossed the weapon as soon as he opened the car door. Deputies can be heard on the video yelling ""Gun!"" as he tried to escape.

The body-cam footage shows Abelar diving to the ground. That video, as well as a slowed down version of the clip provided to The Times by his attorney, does not show a gun in Abelar's hands at the moment Liu shoots him. His right arm can be seen outstretched and empty in the video, though his left arm isn't visible.

Deputies recovered a loaded handgun at the scene ""on the ground north of the vehicle,"" according to the sheriff's department report.

Documents turned over by the sheriff's department to prosecutors -- which Beck obtained in discovery in a civil lawsuit he filed this year on Abelar's behalf -- show one internal incident report describing the encounter as an ""assault with a deadly weapon against a peace officer."" Liu is listed among the victims.

None of the deputies alleged Abelar pointed a gun at them, a necessary element for that crime to be charged, according to Beck and the sheriff's department report. One deputy said he didn't even see the weapon until it was recovered. The video also does not show Abelar point the gun at anyone.

An assault case has not been presented against Abelar, according to the district attorney's office. Nicole Nishida, a sheriff's department spokeswoman, said only that the issue of whether or not Abelar had committed an assault was ""being investigated.""

Beck said he believes the deputies were simply looking for a way to cast blame on his client, who he said is lucky to be alive.

""If this bullet had gone one millimeter to the left or one millimeter to the right, he would have been paralyzed, or he would have been dead,"" the attorney said.

During a recent interview in Gloria Molina Grand Park in downtown L.A., Abelar's leg began to shake as an LAPD cruiser went by. Already unnerved by police, now he says his ""anxiety goes up"" whenever he sees an officer or deputy. He said he hasn't worked since the shooting and his back constantly hurts.

Abelar said he went to J&R Auto that day because he had a problem with his brakes and Doktor -- the shop owner known in the neighborhood by the nickname ""Brooklyn"" -- was a family friend.

But Doktor, a 63-year-old with an unmistakable New York accent, called the sheriff's department's Temple station directly asking deputies to get Abelar ""off his property,"" according to recordings made public by law enforcement. In the call, Doktor described Abelar as ""inked from head to toe"" and demanding car repairs because he was fleeing from the cops due to an active murder warrant.

Doktor told The Times this week that Abelar drove into the auto body shop's parking lot at a high rate of speed, ""waved a gun around"" and pointed it at two of Doktor's mechanics, insisting he had just been involved in a shooting in Alhambra.

Abelar denies all of Doktor's accusations. He was not wanted for murder at the time of the shooting, according to the sheriff's department, though Abelar did have an active warrant for a probation violation. None of Doktor's allegations concerning Abelar threatening people with a gun or claiming to have shot someone are reflected in the sheriff's department's report on the incident.

Doktor said Abelar's actions were captured by surveillance cameras at his auto body shop, but that the sheriff's department took that footage from him the day of the shooting. When they returned the files, Doktor said, the videos were unplayable. Doktor also could not point The Times to any other employees who would corroborate his allegations.

The mechanic stood by his version of events, but also said the deputies were in the wrong for shooting Abelar.

""That kid was no threat,"" he said of the shooting, adding that he screamed at deputies on scene for opening fire and that he saw Abelar throw the gun away.

Doktor says his business has been ""in the toilet"" since the shooting, in part because the sheriff's department described him as an ""informant"" in their videos detailing the incident. While the sheriff's department didn't release his name, his voice is easily recognizable. Doktor said some regular customers moved on out of fear that the violent incident that day would be repeated. Others have fled due to the threats.

In addition to the ""rat"" graffiti outside his shop, Doktor says he's found dead rodents and bullets thrown over the fence. Several mechanics have quit, he said.

Nishida said no such threats have been reported to the sheriff's department's Temple station, which patrols the area where the shop is located, and refuted Doktor's complaints about the video footage.

""No video footage was destroyed or erased,"" she said. ""Homicide investigators only made a digital copy of what was on the surveillance equipment and returned it.""

Beck said he considers Doktor an ""unreliable"" witness and still has no idea why the investigation into the shooting has taken so long. The civil lawsuit against the sheriff's department is pending. The county has denied all wrongdoing in legal filings and a trial date is set for next March.

The sheriff's department's report only lists six witnesses to the incident -- the three responding deputies, Doktor, Abelar and Abelar's ex-girlfriend -- and the confrontation itself was brief and captured on camera, the lawyer said.

""They had to know this was a bad shooting,"" Beck said. ""The best way to deal with it was to suppress it.""","{'uri': 'latimes.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'Los Angeles Times'}",[],https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/6a8f653/2147483647/strip/true/crop/7964x4480+0+416/resize/1200x675!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F3d%2Fb3%2Febd881c04872ab9d3cb2251e9d26%2F1369556-me-adrian-abelar-shooting-147.jpg,,-0.2235294117647059,25,25,Los Angeles Times,latimes.com

SMITH / AFP via Getty Images

The American Civil Liberties Union challenged Florida's ban on pro-Palestinian university groups, arguing in a federal lawsuit on Thursday that the state is violating students' free speech as tensions roil U.S. campuses over Israel's war with Hamas.

Florida's university system, joined by Governor Ron DeSantis, last month ordered colleges to shut down chapters of Students for Justice in Palestine (SJP), a group at the center of U.S. campus activism since Hamas attacked Israel on Oct. 7.

The lawsuit -- against DeSantis, a 2024 Republican presidential hopeful, and several state university system officials -- was filed on behalf of the University of Florida's SJP chapter and seeks a preliminary injunction to a state order blocking SJP from receiving school funds and using campus facilities.

""If Florida officials think silencing pro-Palestinian students protects the Jewish community -- or anyone, they're wrong. This attack on free speech is dangerous,"" Howard Simon, interim executive director of ACLU of Florida, said in a statement.

A spokesperson for DeSantis said the governor was right to disband the groups.

""Groups that claim to be part of a foreign terrorist movement have no place on our university campuses,"" governor spokesperson Jeremy Redfern said.

State University System of Florida Chancellor Ray Rodrigues did not respond to a request for comment.

Students at U.S. universities have clashed over issues emerging on both sides of the nearly six-week-old conflict. Some accuse their schools of not doing enough to denounce antisemitism and others that the schools ignore the plight of Gazans under Israeli fire.

The lawsuit, filed in U.S. District Court in Florida by the ACLU, ACLU of Florida and Palestine Legal, cites a Supreme Court decision affirming students' right to associate and speak out on matters of public concern, and another case establishing that federal law does not criminalize ""independent political advocacy"" as long as it is not done in coordination with, or at the direction of, foreign terrorist groups.

Brandeis University has also banned SJP indefinitely, and Columbia University and George Washington University have suspended the group. The schools have cited the national organization's support for the Hamas attack and said their campus chapters violated school policies.

The student groups call the suspensions and bans unjust. Videos posted to Instagram have shown Palestinian supporters rallying at Columbia and George Washington on Wednesday in protest over the SJP groups' suspensions.

Florida's university system has said it based its ban on a ""toolkit"" issued by the national organization to chapters that referred to Hamas' attack as ""the resistance"" and stated ""Palestinian students in exile are PART of this movement.""

In his Oct. 24 memo ordering the ban, Chancellor Rodrigues said the national SJP identified itself as part of Hamas' attack and that it was a felony under Florida law ""to provide material support... to a designated foreign terrorist organization.""

Brian Hauss, senior staff attorney with the ACLU Speech, Privacy and Technology project and counsel in the case, said the student plaintiffs in the state university system were victims of ""guilt by association"" in this case.

""They are a completely autonomous and independent group that is in no way beholden to the national Students for Justice in Palestine,"" Hauss said in an interview, adding that he did not believe the national organization could be found criminally liable for its statements about Hamas.

Israel says Hamas killed 1,200 people in the Oct. 7 assault and took about 240 hostages to Gaza. Gaza health authorities say more than 11,000 people have been confirmed killed in Israel's counteroffensive in Gaza.","{'uri': 'nbcnews.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'NBC News'}",[],"https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_nbcnews-fp-1024-512,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2023-11/231117-gaza-protest-ny-1052-6f09b0.jpg",eng-9068745,-0.2392156862745098,25,25,NBC News,nbcnews.com

Less than 30 seconds after the agents first spoke to him, Mattia slumped to the ground. A cellphone, not a firearm, lay on the ground.

His sister Annette Mattia, 61, was just yards away in her own house the night of May 18. Five months later, she choked down tears while standing near the spot where he lay.

""This is where he lived, and it just is sadness and anger because it didn't have to happen at all,"" she said. ""If they would have talked to him it would have turned out a lot different because you know he wasn't a threat.""

""He didn't deserve to die like this,"" her daughter Yvonne Nevarez, 43, added.

Now, the family wants justice.

""To me it feels like there are still murderers walking around. Who knows they might be back out here again? Who knows what they might do to anyone else?"" Annette Mattia said in an interview outside her home.

The family, several of whom live on a compound in Menagers Dam Village within the Tohono O'odham Nation, believe that the agents ruthlessly gunned a man down with scant regard for his constitutional rights. But federal prosecutors have already said there will be no criminal charges.

A recent Supreme Court ruling means any effort to sue the agents individually for alleged constitutional violations is doomed to fail. The 2022 ruling is one in a line of cases that has decimated the ability of victims to file lawsuits, known as ""Bivens claims,"" accusing Border Patrol agents of using excessive force or other constitutional violations.

The court's dismantling of Bivens has reverberated throughout the federal government and touched nearly every agency, but Border Patrol represents a large fraction of armed federal law enforcement and the geography of their jurisdiction presents a uniquely thorny set of legal questions.

The court, in a case called Egbert v. Boule that involved a claim against a Border Patrol agent, introduced a new legal test that makes it virtually impossible to bring a wide range of claims against federal officials.

And so the Mattia family is far from alone.

In the aftermath of the ruling, lawsuits alleging a wide range of constitutional violations are now routinely tossed out. People mistreated by federal officials aren't getting their day in court, instead being denied the chance to find out if a jury would agree that their constitutional rights were violated. The court has also made it harder to sue government officials by continually strengthening the legal defense known as qualified immunity -- a point that drew the direct ire of protesters during the rise of the Black Lives Matter movement in 2020 in the wake of the police killing of George Floyd.

In the 12 months after Egbert, lower courts cited it 228 times in a range of cases against all kinds of federal officials, according to an NBC News search using the LexisNexis legal database. In 195 of those cases, constitutional claims were dismissed.

Also in the year after the Egbert ruling, judges tossed more than a dozen lawsuits in which Customs and Border Protection (CBP), which Border Patrol is part of, or Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officers were defendants accused of violating constitutional rights.

Among the 15 out of 16 claims dismissed:

Even when a federal employee at the Department of Homeland Security sued officials in the department for malicious prosecution after being accused of falsifying documents, a judge dismissed the claim partly on the grounds that, in line with Egbert, ""regulating the conduct of immigration agents similarly risks judicial intrusion into national security.""

Some plaintiffs gave up in light of the Egbert decision. Abdulkadir Nur, a Somali American Muslim, who said he was harassed by border protection agents at the airport every time he entered the country, withdrew his Bivens claim after the ruling was issued.

""It's been predictably a nightmare. We have had to voluntarily dismiss Bivens claims in most of our cases,"" said Justin Sadowsky, a lawyer with the legal arm of the Council on American-Islamic Relations, which represents Nur.

The message to federal officers accused of misdeeds is clear: You won't face lawsuits for your actions.

Without individual accountability, wrongdoers are protected and unconstitutional practices can quickly become normalized among sprawling federal agencies like the Border Patrol, civil rights advocates say.

The plight facing Mattia's family puts the spotlight on how the Supreme Court ruling affects the U.S.-Mexico border, an area many already view as a lawless hinterland where constitutional rights are not respected.

""The court's opinion in Egbert is unequivocal that there is no damages action available against any Border Patrol agent for any reason,"" including over what happened to Mattia, said Patrick Jaicomo, a lawyer with the libertarian-leaning Institute for Justice.

Lawyers for the Mattia family plan to pursue a wrongful death claim against the federal government, with an announcement scheduled for Friday, the details of which were exclusively shared with NBC News. And while the lawyers say they are not yet completely ruling out bringing a lawsuit alleging constitutional violations against the officers themselves, they concede that they would be facing extremely long odds.

""It makes it very, very difficult to hold the individual officers accountable in front of a jury,"" lawyer Timothy Scott said of the Egbert ruling.

The agents handcuffed him, blood soaking through his jacket.

""Where's the firearm?"" an agent asked.

Another tended to his wounds: ""Keep breathing, bro,"" he said.

The agents encountered Mattia at 9:39 p.m. He was pronounced dead at 10:06 p.m.

Whether the officers were looking for Mattia that night, or knew him before, remains unclear. His story is complicated. A toxicology report indicated he had alcohol, methamphetamine and oxycodone in his system at the time of death. He had a criminal record that included a conviction for a sex offense decades ago.

For Annette Mattia, learning about the recent Supreme Court ruling feels like insult added to injury after what happened to her brother.

""They know they're going to get away with it,"" she said.

Mark Harper was unable to say whether the UK should be prepared to leave the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) but said ministers would do ""what it takes"" to send asylum seekers to Kigali including through ""change"" to international agreements.

The Prime Minister has announced plans for emergency legislation and a new treaty with the east African nation in a bid to address issues that led the UK's highest court to rule the policy was unlawful.

A Government source said the upgraded deal with Rwanda would be published ""shortly"" but perhaps not as soon as Monday, as reports earlier suggested.

Speaking to Sky News on Friday, Transport Secretary Mr Harper said: ""We're confident (the measures) will enable us to send people to Rwanda.""

The minister was asked about the latest intervention from Suella Braverman, who claimed in an article for The Telegraph that the policy would fail unless the PM is more radical.

""The point is we do need to make changes to the legal position. That is why on Wednesday immediately after the Supreme Court judgment the Prime Minister set out two things,"" he said.

""First of all we are concluding a new treaty with Rwanda. We weren't sitting on our hands when the Supreme Court was considering this case. We were already working on contingencies depending on what they set out.""

He added: ""That will make the position very clear for the courts and we are confident that that will enable us to send people to Rwanda to break the business model of these organised crime groups which is what the British people want us to do.""

Asked on LBC later whether he would be happy for Parliament to sit through Christmas in order to get the emergency legislation on the statute books as soon as possible, he said: ""Well, I'm very happy to do whatever it takes to deliver our commitment, but scheduling parliamentary business is not a matter for me. But I'm prepared to do what it takes to deliver our commitments to the British people.""

Transport Secretary Mark Harper defended the Rwanda plan (Stefan Rousseau/PA)

Mrs Braverman, who was fired in a reshuffle earlier this week, said a solution to the challenge of stopping migrants crossing the English Channel ""demands of the Government an end to self-deception and spin"".

""Tinkering with a failed plan will not stop the boats,"" she wrote in The Telegraph.

Former deputy prime minister Damian Green said that her proposal to pass a law that would block Rwanda deportation appeals is ""profoundly unconservative"".

He said that it would ""sweep away"" all judicial review protection for asylum seekers.

""It's not just all our own laws passed by Parliament, and all international treaties that we have signed, that Suella wants to sweep away,"" he said.

""Conservatives believe in a democratic country run by the rule of law. And dictators, Xi and Putin, would prefer to have the state completely untrammelled by any law. And so, as a democrat I oppose it.

""But quite specifically as a conservative, because if we conservatives don't believe that the state should be controlled by the law, that the Government has to obey the law as much as you or I have to obey the law, then that seems to me to be very profoundly unconservative.""

Meanwhile, Lord Sumption, a former Supreme Court judge, told the BBC the plan to use a law to declare Rwanda as safe was ""profoundly discreditable,"" ""constitutionally really quite extraordinary"" and would ""effectively overrule"" a decision by the UK's highest court.

The yet-to-be-published treaty with Rwanda is expected to attempt to address the Supreme Court's concerns around refoulement - the potential for refugees whose applications for asylum are rejected by Kigali to be sent back to the country they are fleeing from.

The emergency legislation is expected to enable Parliament to deem the east African nation safe.","{'uri': 'dailymail.co.uk', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'Daily Mail Online'}",[],https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2023/11/17/10/wire-77924959-1700217830-509_636x382.jpg,eng-9063836,0.2156862745098038,25,25,Daily Mail Online,dailymail.co.uk

Mrs Braverman, who was sacked in a reshuffle this week, said Mr Sunak's ""tinkering"" of the plans to overcome the Supreme Court's verdict that it was unlawful would ""culminate in yet another defeat"" for the government.

Writing in The Telegraph, she said the prime minister's proposals would likely get bogged down in the domestic and European court system.

She has proposed introducing emergency legislation to amend the Illegal Migration Act that should meet five key tests. We take a look at those points below:

Ms Braverman said the government must tackle the issues raised by the five senior judges about Rwanda's asylum and legal system. It can do this by ""embedding UK observers and independent reviewers of asylum decisions"".

These commitments should then be ""embodied in an amended memorandum or a new treaty"" which would ensure that ""Rwanda's safety could be credibly confirmed"".

The former home secretary said that any amendments must exclude ""all avenues of legal challenge"".

Any of the UK's domestic or international obligations - for example, the European Convention on Human Rights - need to be made invalid using ""notwithstanding clauses"". Common law challenges or Judicial Review must also be ""expressly excluded"".

She added: ""Individuals would, however, be given the chance to demonstrate that they had entered the country legally, were under 18, or were medically unfit to fly - but Home Office decisions on these claims could not be challenged in court.""

Ms Braverman said those who arrive on small boats across the channel should be removed ""in a matter of days rather than months"".

This means that migrants due to be moved to Rwanda are mandated ""under the duty to remove, with strict time limits"" which will have the benefit of streamlining the process for the Home Office.

Ms Braverman said that ""any legal challenges to detention must be excluded to avoid burdening the courts, making it clear that detention is mandated until removal.""

Judge David Friedman of the state's intermediate appeals court issued what's known as a stay -- suspending the gag order and allowing the former president to speak freely about court staff while a longer appeals process plays out.

The trial judge, Arthur Engoron, imposed the gag order Oct. 3 after Trump posted a false comment about the judge's law clerk to social media on the second day of the trial in New York Atty. Gen. Letitia James' lawsuit. James alleges that Trump exaggerated his wealth on financial statements used to secure loans and make deals.

Engoron later fined Trump $15,000 for violating the gag order and expanded it to include his lawyers after they questioned clerk Allison Greenfield's prominent role on the bench, where she sits alongside the judge, exchanging notes and advising him during testimony. Friedman's ruling allows the lawyers to again comment about court staff.

At an emergency hearing Thursday, Friedman questioned Engoron's authority to police what Trump says outside the courtroom. He also disputed the trial judge's contention that restricting the 2024 Republican front-runner's speech was necessary or the right remedy to protect his staff's safety.

""Considering the constitutional and statutory rights at issue, an interim stay is granted,"" Friedman said, announcing his decision as he scribbled it on a court order.

The appellate court intervened after Trump's lawyers filed a lawsuit against Engoron late Wednesday that challenged his gag order as an abuse of power. They sued the judge under a state law known as Article 78, which allows lawsuits over some judicial decisions.

Trump and his lawyers have been increasingly frustrated with Engoron presiding over the non-jury trial in James' lawsuit. Trump, angered by a pretrial fraud ruling imperiling his real estate empire, has called him an ""extremely hostile"" judge. His lawyers Wednesday asked for a mistrial, citing evidence of ""tangible and overwhelming"" bias.

Trump and his lawyers have repeatedly criticized Greenfield, contending that the former judicial candidate is a partisan voice in Engoron's ear. Both Greenfield and Engoron are Democrats.

Engoron did not address the gag order ruling in court Thursday afternoon. Regarding the mistrial motion, he gave James' office until Dec. 8 to respond before he rules.

Several of Trump's lawyers and state lawyers from James' office left the Manhattan trial to attend the emergency hearing at a state appellate courthouse a couple miles away. They sat around a table in a conference room and argued for about 45 minutes before Friedman ruled.

Trump lawyer Christopher Kise lauded the temporary stay as the ""right decision.""

Friedman has ""allowed President Trump to take full advantage of his constitutional 1st Amendment rights to talk about bias in his own trial, what he's seeing and witnessing in his own trial -- which, frankly, everyone needs to see,"" Kise said.

Trump didn't wait long to lash out at Greenfield, calling her a ""politically biased and out of control, Trump Hating Clerk"" in a post to his Truth Social platform Thursday night.

Trump lawyer Alina Habba said she saw no reason to tell Trump to stay quiet about the clerk, telling reporters that James ""is continuing to disparage"" her client and that ""both sides need to be able to speak.""

State lawyers and a court system lawyer representing Engoron urged the appellate judge to keep the gag order in place. They argued that the trial judge had taken a reasonable step to protect his staff amid increased threats to their safety.

Engoron and his staff have received hundreds of threatening and antisemitic phone calls and letters since the trial began Oct. 2, court system lawyer Lisa Evans said. She blamed Trump's comments about Engoron and Greenfield for amplifying his supporters' anger toward them. Greenfield is ""playing Whac-A-Mole now trying to block her number,"" Evans said.

""It's not that Mr. Trump has directly issued threats to the staff and Judge Engoron; it's that what he's said has led his constituents"" to make threats, Evans argued, comparing the potential effect to the Jan. 6 capitol riot and a violent attack on Rep. Nancy Pelosi's husband, Paul.

""That is not political speech. That is threatening behavior and it should be stopped,"" Evans said.

Kise suggested the safety concerns were overblown, arguing that Engoron was using the guise of threats -- and the ""hobgoblins of 'Trump's a bad person and he says bad things'"" -- to keep the former president and his lawyers from questioning Greenfield's influence on the trial.

Trump hasn't threatened Greenfield, nor has he disclosed any personal information such as her home address, Kise said. Meanwhile, he noted, she's routinely photographed sitting next to Engoron by media photographers and videographers covering the trial.

State lawyer Daniel Magy argued that Trump's immense social media audience had made the clerk more of a target for threats. Trump's offending social media post was based on a post by someone else who was followed by just a handful of people.

Both posts included a picture that Greenfield had publicly posted online of her with Senate Majority Leader Charles E. Schumer, but Trump added a falsehood about her personal life before sending it off to his millions of followers.","{'uri': 'latimes.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'Los Angeles Times'}",[],https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/9709efc/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3676x2068+0+192/resize/1200x675!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F1e%2F6b%2F0356fa759b469a7d37cd0bd46a76%2Fe648123a7de74b1eab5ad0454e7406e9,eng-9065743,-0.1215686274509804,25,25,Los Angeles Times,latimes.com

A former deputy prime minister and Conservative MP has attacked Suella Braverman's latest plan to send asylum seekers to Rwanda as ""unconservative"" and ""dictatorial"", as the former home secretary continues to divide her party with her outspoken interventions.

Damian Green, who also served as an immigration minister, said on Friday that Braverman's proposal to pass a law to get around the legal obstacles to the Rwanda plan identified earlier this week by the supreme court would be ""the most unconservative proposal I've ever heard"".

Green was responding to an article by the former home secretary in Friday's Telegraph, in which she suggested parliament should pass a new emergency law to override several pieces of domestic and international legislation. The article is the former home secretary's latest intervention as part of what allies say will be a ""grid of shit"" for the government following her dismissal on Monday.

Green told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""This is the most unconservative proposal I've ever heard. You know conservatives believe in a democratic country, run by the rule of law. Dictators like Xi [Jinping] and [Vladimir] Putin would prefer to have the state completely untrammelled by any law.""

He added: ""Defending the principle that governments have to obey the law is really important for conservatives, perhaps particularly at times of heightened political change.""

Braverman used the Telegraph article on Friday to call for a five-point plan to get the government's long-delayed plan to deport asylum seekers to Rwanda off the ground, following the supreme court ruling on Wednesday that it is unlawful.

She argued firstly that the government should agree measures with Rwanda to ensure that refugees do not get sent back to their countries of origin.

Secondly she said MPs should pass a new law to override the European convention on human rights, the Human Rights Act and any other relevant piece of legislation.

Third, she argued asylum seekers should be deported within days of arrival.

She said new arrivals should be detained until deportation and that parliament should sit over Christmas to pass the new laws.

The article is the latest in a series of public statements from Braverman which have caused a headache for the prime minister, Rishi Sunak.

Two weeks ago she defended a plan to restrict the use of tents by homeless people, saying that sleeping rough was a ""lifestyle choice"". She then engaged in a public row with the head of the Metropolitan police, Sir Mark Rowley, over whether he should ban a pro-Palestine march on Armistice Day. That culminated in a piece for the Times in which she accused the police of being biased in the way they handle public demonstrations.

Sunak finally sacked her as home secretary on Monday but she has continued to cause problems for him, writing a public letter accusing him of being weak and reneging on promises he made to her during his leadership campaign.

Sir David Normington, a former permanent secretary at the Home Office, said Braverman's latest ideas on how to revive the Rwanda plan were unworkable.

""One of the things we keep hearing, and this is Suella Braverman's latest idea, is that we should remove all appeals, that we should close off all routes,"" he said on Friday.

""I really don't think that that is possible. I think in the end the supreme court wouldn't allow that.""

Allies of the former home secretary say she will make more public statements in the coming days, as critics accuse her of preparing the ground for a leadership bid should the Conservatives lose the next election.

They have also defended her latest proposals, saying they constitute the best way to meet the prime minister's pledge to stop small boats crossing the Channel.

Sir Simon Clarke, a former cabinet minister, told the BBC: ""I'm in favour of doing what is required to make this policy deliverable.

The ousted ex-Home Secretary tore apart the PM's plan B for deportation flights.

Writing in The Telegraph she said proposals to strike a new treaty with Rwanda in order to alleviate the concerns of Supreme Court judges won't solve the ""fundamental issues"" with the scheme.

She welcomed Mr Sunak's desire to ""introduce emergency legislation"" but added that for this to happen ""parliament needs to amend the Illegal Migration Act"" .

Ms Braverman announced a five point plan for getting flights off the tarmac.

First, the Bill must address the Supreme Court's concerns about Rwanda being unsafe.

Second, it must contain a clause legislating for flights to take off before the next election.

Third, those arriving illegally must be removed in a matter of days rather than months.

Fourth, legal challenges to detention must be excluded to avoid burdening the courts.

Finally, the Bill should be introduced before Christmas and Parliament should be recalled to debate over the festive season.

Ms Braverman said: ""Now is not the time to waste energy on a post-mortem of how we got here.

""What matters for those of us who believe in effective immigration control is how to move forward.

""This requires honesty.

""There is no longer any chance of stopping the boats within the current legal framework.

""Having committed to emergency legislation, the Prime Minister must now give Parliamentarians a clear choice: to either properly control illegal migration, or explain to the British people why they are powerless under international law and must simply accept ever greater numbers of illegal arrivals on these shores.""

Ms Braverman's intervention comes as her successor James Cleverly yesterday insisted a fresh Rwanda treaty will be done ""in days"".

The new Home Secretary said he was ""absolutely determined"" to get flights off before the next election despite the Supreme Court tearing the plan to shreds.

He also said he did not ""recognise"" claims that he once privately branded the migration policy as ""bats***"".

He said the treaty - which will ensure no asylum seeker can be deported from Rwanda to a potentially unsafe place - within ""matter of days"".

But there are fears even once ratified by MPs it will get bunged up in the Lords and the courts once again - putting paid to the PM's hopes of getting flights by the spring.

Former Supreme Court Justice Lord Sumption criticised the move to have a second crack as ""constitutionally extraordinary"".

Mr Sunak yesterday admitted: ""My patience has run thin as has the country's"" -- after his Rwanda deportation scheme was blown up by the Supreme Court.

But he faced a massive Tory backlash and was warned his leadership is now on the line.","{'uri': 'thesun.co.uk', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'The Sun'}","[{'uri': 'noa_hoffman@thesun.co.uk', 'name': 'Noa Hoffman', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': False}]",https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/former-home-secretary-suella-braverman-859768119.jpg?strip=all&quality=100&w=1920&h=1080&crop=1,eng-9063836,-0.06666666666666665,25,25,The Sun,thesun.co.uk

The European Union has become the first international body to criminalise widescale environmental damage ""comparable to ecocide"".

Late on Thursday, lawmakers agreed an update to the bloc's environmental crime directive punishing the most serious cases of ecosystem destruction, including habitat loss and illegal logging, with tougher penalties.

Marie Toussaint, a French lawyer and MEP spearheading EU efforts to criminalise ecocide, said the move ""marks the end of impunity for environmental criminals"" and could usher in a new age of environmental litigation in Europe.

The environmental crime directive will be formally passed in the spring, and member states will then have two years to put it into national law.

Although the agreed text does not itself include the actual word ""ecocide"", its preamble says it intends to criminalise ""cases comparable to ecocide"". These are actions that cause widespread, substantial and irreversible or long-lasting damage to large or important ecosystems, habitats or the quality of air, soil or water.

This closely follows a definition of ecocide developed by an international panel of legal experts in 2021. The definition was mainly intended to be adopted by the international criminal court through an amendment to the Rome statute - the key goal of the Stop Ecocide Foundation - but is now increasingly being used for national-level legislation. Scotland, for example, recently began consulting on whether to introduce the UK's first ecocide law.

The revised EU law specifies which kinds of environmental activities are covered. These include water abstraction, ship recycling and pollution, the introduction and spread of invasive alien species, and ozone destruction. But it does not say anything about fishing, the export of toxic waste to developing countries or carbon market fraud.

Having a permit to carry out listed activities will not automatically be an excuse. Individuals and companies will have committed a crime if that authorisation was obtained fraudulently or by corruption, extortion or coercion, or if it breaches substantive legal requirements.

Lawmakers did not agree to extend these obligations to offences committed outside EU borders on behalf of EU companies, but individual member states would be able to choose to do this themselves.

The law introduces new penalties, ranging from prison sentences for individuals to exclusion from access to public funds for companies. Member states will also be able to choose whether to introduce fines for companies based on a proportion of their turnover (up to 5% depending on the crime) or fixed amounts of up to €40m (£35m).

Virginijus Sinkevičius, EU commissioner for environment, oceans and fisheries, said environmental crimes are serious, lucrative and on the rise. Annual revenues from the illegal waste market in the EU, for example, range between €4 and €15bn.

""The EU agreed a new law that recognises their gravity, especially when large ecosystems are destroyed,"" said Sinkevičius. ""Our health depends on the state of the environment in which we live, so we must deter criminals willing to destroy ecosystems for profit.""

Toussaint said the EU had now adopted some of the most ambitious legislation in the world. ""In the European political context, this text is a point of support for all those who defend the environment in court and fight the impunity of criminal firms who too often flout the laws and work today to unravelling environmental democracy in Europe.""

The agreement followed months of negotiation between the European Council, commission and parliament, as well as active civil society campaigning.

Jojo Mehta, co-founder and executive director of Stop Ecocide International, said the updated law would genuinely help member states take environmental harms much more seriously. ""This is highly significant and to be wholeheartedly commended, and we can see from the rapidly growing momentum of the ecocide law initiative that European states will not be long in engaging more deeply with it in their own jurisdictions.""

""Indeed, I have no doubt that with this direction of travel being rapidly established, it is only a matter of time before ecocide is recognised in criminal law at every level.""","{'uri': 'theguardian.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'The Guardian'}",[],https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/11294fe9a91fbf7801fa61ca3c0272033715d796/0_1_3168_1901/master/3168.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&s=6ff760284649ee2d68491b2709d5f734,,-0.3803921568627451,25,25,The Guardian,theguardian.com

The extraordinary in-fighting came after the ex-Home Secretary suggested introducing emergency powers to exclude ""all avenues of legal challenge"" in a bid to get flights off the ground.

Hitting out at her comments the Tory MP Damian Green said it was the ""most unconservative statement I have ever heard from a Conservative politician"". He added: ""Giving the state explicit power to override every legal constraint is what [Vladimir] Putin and Xi [Jinping] do. We absolutely cannot go there"".

Speaking on BBC Radio 4's Today programme, he added: ""Conservatives believe in a democratic country run by the rule of law and dictators - Xi and Putin - would prefer to have the state completely untrammelled by any law.""

This week the Supreme Court unanimously torpedoed Rishi Sunak's plans to deport asylum seekers to Rwanda, ruling the project already costing £140million is unlawful. The Tory leader has since pledged to introduce ""emergency legislation"" to resurrect the proposals by having Parliament deem Rwanda a ""safe country"".

But in an article for the Telegraph, Ms Braverman, who was sacked from the Cabinet on Monday, warned flights will not take off before the election under the plan. She said: ""To try and deliver flights to Rwanda under any new treaty would still require going back through the courts, a process that would likely take at least another year.

""Even if we won in the domestic court, the saga would simply relocate to Strasbourg where the European court would take its time deciding if it liked our laws. ""That is why the plan outlined by the PM will not yield flights to Rwanda before an election if Plan B is simply a tweaked version of the failed Plan A.""

The former Cabinet minister proposed ""five tests"" including the incendiary suggestion of excluding the prospect of legal challenges to the Government's plan.

She wrote: ""The Bill must enable flights before the next general election. Legislation must therefore circumvent the lengthy process of further domestic litigation, to ensure that flights can take off as soon as the new Bill becomes law. To do this, the Bill must exclude all avenues of legal challenge. ""

The right-wing Conservative also suggested Parliament sit over Christmas to ensure the new emergency law can be passed before next year.

On Thursday the Tory Chancellor Jeremy Hunt refused to commit to asylum seekers being sent to the east African country in 2024 - or before the next election. He said: ""We are hopeful that because of the solutions that the Prime Minister announced yesterday we will be able to get flights off to Rwanda next year. We can't guarantee that.""

Speaking on BBC Question Time, the Shadow Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson said she hoped Tory ministers ""give up"" on the ""unworkable"" and Rwanda plan. She added: ""I agree with the new Home Secretary who described the policy as being batshit. It's just not going to work, it's not the right approach. It's costing us £140million"".","{'uri': 'mirror.co.uk', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'Mirror'}","[{'uri': 'ashley_cowburn@mirror.co.uk', 'name': 'Ashley Cowburn', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': False}]",https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article31460935.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/3_Suella-Braverman-Bushy-United-Kingdom-16-Nov-2023.jpg,eng-9063836,0.04313725490196085,25,25,Mirror,mirror.co.uk

Whistleblower David McBride has pleaded guilty to three charges after an ACT supreme court upheld a commonwealth intervention to withhold key evidence it deemed as having the potential to jeopardise ""the security and defence of Australia"" if released.

Originally facing five charges, the former military lawyer pleaded guilty in the ACT supreme court on Friday afternoon to three offences, including stealing commonwealth information and passing that on to journalists at the Australian Broadcasting Corporation.

The ABC subsequently used the material as the basis for an investigative series exposing war crimes in Afghanistan, titled The Afghan Files.

On Friday afternoon, Justice David Mossop upheld the commonwealth's claim that certain documents, if released, had the potential to jeopardise ""the security and defence of Australia"" and should not be used by the parties.

Andrew Berger KC, acting for the commonwealth, on Wednesday said some material in the case should be kept entirely secret on national security grounds.

""The public interest at play here is a very important one, the national security and defence of this country,"" he said. ""Indeed, we say it is harder to think of a stronger public interest than the security and defence of Australia.""

Berger presented evidence from intelligence agencies, including the Office of National Intelligence, suggesting that its disclosure could compromise intelligence information provided by Australia's allies.

Releasing those documents, Berger added, would jeopardise Australia's information-sharing agreements with foreign intelligence agencies and damage Australia's reputation more broadly.

McBride's counsel, Stephen Odgers SC, had previously indicated he may apply to have the trial halted if the commonwealth's bid to keep documents secret was accepted.

The former military lawyer's team suffered a blow on Thursday after they lost a legal bid to overturn a ruling by Justice Mossop preventing McBride from arguing he was fulfilling his duty to the public interest in releasing the classified documents.

The trial was scheduled to begin on Monday. A sentencing date is expected to be scheduled in the new year.","{'uri': 'theguardian.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","[{'uri': 'christopher_knaus@theguardian.com', 'name': 'Christopher Knaus', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': False}, {'uri': 'sarah_basford_canales@theguardian.com', 'name': 'Sarah Basford Canales', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': False}]",https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/daba19a8d36f3841d4961e9104d61a15436f00c5/0_50_5472_3283/master/5472.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&s=16d46589fe2fa21814394a4700291747,,0.3725490196078431,25,25,The Guardian,theguardian.com

Here's a look at what it does,"{{ #verifyErrors }}{{ message }}{{ /verifyErrors }}{{ ^verifyErrors }}Something went wrong. Please try again later{{ /verifyErrors }}

A trial for a lawsuit challenging the constitutionality of Missouri's new photo identification requirement for voters is scheduled to begin Friday. Here is a look at the function of the law and why voting rights groups are suing:

WHAT THE LAW DOES

Missouri's GOP-led Legislature last year capped off a nearly two-decade-long push by Republicans and passed a law requiring voters to show photo identification to cast a regular ballot.

People without a government-issued photo ID can cast provisional ballots to be counted if they return later that day with a photo ID or if election officials verify their signatures. The law requires the state to provide a free photo identification card to those lacking one to vote.

LEGAL CHALLENGES

The Missouri League of Women Voters, NAACP and two voters sued to overturn the law last year, arguing the change makes casting ballots unconstitutionally difficult for some voters.

Cole County Presiding Judge Jon Beetem, who also will hear arguments in the trial beginning Friday, dismissed the case in October 2022. He found neither of the two voters ""alleged a specific, concrete, non-speculative injury or legally protectable interest in challenging the photo ID requirement.""

The Missouri ACLU and Missouri Voter Protection Coalition, who sued on behalf of the plaintiffs, have since added another voter to the lawsuit and asked Beetem again to find the voter ID requirement unconstitutional.

ARGUMENTS AGAINST THE LAW

The newest plaintiff is John O'Connor, a 90-year-old Columbia, Missouri, resident with poor vision who needs help walking. When the law took effect last year, O'Connor had an expired passport and driver's license, which are not acceptable forms of identification to vote under state law.

His lawyers argued he eventually obtained a non-driver's license with the help of his wife, but only because officials accepted his expired driver's license despite guidance from the state Revenue Department that long-expired licenses are not acceptable records to use when seeking new IDs.

""Even when a voter obtains the underlying documentation, voters who lack transportation, cannot get to the DMV or other government agencies during their hours of operation, or have a disability or impairment that prevents them from accessing a DMV, the voter is still unable to surmount the burdens to obtaining a photo ID,"" the plaintiffs' lawyers wrote in a pretrial brief.

ARGUMENTS FOR THE LAW

Republican Attorney General Andrew Bailey's office is defending the law in court. The state lawyers argue that, so far, no one has been turned away at the polls because of the law.

Missouri provides free non-driver's licenses for voting to those who do not already have a driver's license or have a current license. The health department's Bureau of Vital Records provides free birth certificates to those seeking their first non-driver's license in order to vote if the applicant does not have a current driver's license.

""There is not a severe burden on the right to vote as the State has gone to great lengths to help voters obtain IDs,"" Bailey wrote in a court brief.

VOTER ID ELSEWHERE

The National Conference of State Legislatures reports 36 states request or require identification to vote, of which at least 20 ask for a photo ID.

Other Republican-led states are moving in the same direction as Missouri as they respond to conservative voters unsettled by unfounded claims of widespread fraud and persistent conspiracy theories over the accuracy of U.S. elections. Critics characterize such requirements as an overreaction that could disenfranchise eligible voters.

For the first time this year, Ohio voters were required show photo identification to cast ballots in person. The new law eliminated previously acceptable non-photo options, such as a utility bill, bank statement, government check or paycheck. State-issued photo IDs are available free of charge

Missouri Republicans are not the only ones who had to fight for years to enact ID requirements.

North Carolina's voter photo identification law, enacted nearly five years ago by the Republican-controlled legislature but blocked by litigation, is just now being implemented. Registered voters there can get free IDs at their county election offices if they provide their name, date of birth and the last four digits of their Social Security number.

Nebraska lawmakers this summer passed a voter ID law allowing a wide array of photo identification that voters can present at the polls. IDs include passports, driver's licenses, military and tribal IDs and Nebraska college IDs. Expired IDs are allowed if they have the voter's name and photo. Residents of hospitals, nursing homes and assisted living centers will be able to use patient documents that include a photo.","{'uri': 'independent.co.uk', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'The Independent'}",[],https://static.independent.co.uk/2023/11/17/05/Voter_ID_Missouri_55700.jpg?quality=75&width=1200&auto=webp,eng-9069794,-0.06666666666666665,25,25,The Independent,independent.co.uk

Network 10 is attempting to shift its legal stoush with Lisa Wilkinson to the Federal Court as the two sides battle over her legal bills in the upcoming Bruce Lehrmann defamation case.

Ms Wilkinson has launched court proceedings against Network 10 to force her employer to immediately stump up for her defence in the suit, where both she and the broadcaster are named as respondents.

The two sides are arguing over whether the $700,000 bill should be settled immediately or at the end of the defamation proceedings.

Mr Lehrmann is suing Ms Wilkinson and Network 10 in the Federal Court over her 2021 interview with Brittany Higgins, which aired on The Project, with the trial due to begin on Wednesday.

Ms Wilkinson is also locked in a separate legal battle with Network 10 in the NSW Supreme Court after she elected to hire her own legal representation.

Ms Wilkinson hired high-profile barrister Sue Chrysanthou SC and Gillis Delaney Lawyers partner Anthony Jefferies earlier this year instead of opting to use Network 10's retained law firm Thomson Geer.

According to documents filed in the NSW Supreme Court, she claims the broadcaster is refusing to pay two invoices totalling $723,000 in legal fees.

Barrister Zoe Graus, acting for Ten, told the court on Friday that the network was moving an application to shift the proceedings to the Federal Court, where the defamation suit is being heard.

Justice Michael Bell told the court that the cross-vesting application - to transfer the matter to the Federal Court - 'turned on' whether there was a possibility of inconsistent findings.

The matter will return to court next Friday.

Ms Wilkinson alleges Network 10 twice accepted it was liable to indemnify the TV star even if she was 'independently represented'.

Bruce Lehrmann is suing Ms Wilkinson and Network 10 in the Federal Court over her 2021 interview with Brittany Higgins, which aired on The Project, with the trial due to begin on Wednesday

In a statement, Network 10 said: 'The lawyers engaged by Lisa Wilkinson have issued invoices for a very substantial amount of money, in excess of $700,000, and in good governance these need to be justified through due process.

'In the meantime, Network 10's focus is on defending the defamation claim brought by Bruce Lehrmann.'

Mr Lehrmann has also launched defamation proceedings against the ABC over the live broadcast of a National Press Club address by Ms Higgins.

While he was not named in the report or Ms Higgins' speech, Mr Lehrmann claims he was still identified by the media companies and has alleged there were four defamatory meanings in their publication implying he raped her at Parliament House in March 2019.

Trump has already been fined $15,000 for violating the gag order imposed during the fraud trial brought by New York Attorney General Letitia James

Trump blasted the 'ridiculous and unconstitutional' gag order as well as Engoron who he accused of not allowing him to 'defend myself against him and his politically biased and out of control, Trump Hating Clerk, who is sinking him and his Court to new levels of low.'

Engoron previously fined the 77-year-old Trump a total of $15,000 for two violations of the restriction during the trial brought by New York Attorney General Letitia James.

James was also targeted by Trump, who called her 'the worst and least respected Attorney General in the United States' and a 'worldwide disgrace.'

He fumed: 'The radical and unprecedented actions of Judge Engoron will keep businesses and jobs forever out of New York State.

'I have done nothing wrong my numbers were low, not high, I have a complete disclaimer clause, their star witness admitted he lied and made up this Fake case against me, and the the Attorney General used a ""Get Trump"" platform in order to run for A.G. & Governor (she failed!). This wicked attack on Democracy must be ended, now!'

Judge David Friedman granted an interim stay on the gag order pending a hearing about whether it infringes on Trump's right to free speech

Trump, the frontrunner for the 2024 Republican presidential nomination, and his two eldest sons are accused of inflating the value of their real estate assets to receive more favorable bank loans and insurance terms.

The federal judge set to preside over Trump's March trial in Washington for conspiring to overturn the 2020 presidential election also imposed a partial gag order on the brash billionaire, but that order has also been frozen pending an appeals court hearing to take place on Monday.

US District Judge Tanya Chutkan ordered Trump last month not to publicly attack prosecutors, court staff or potential witnesses ahead of his trial.

Chutkan's ruling came after special counsel Jack Smith, a frequent target of Trump's vitriol, filed a motion claiming the real estate tycoon's inflammatory rhetoric threatened to undermine his trial for election subversion.

Trump was indicted in Washington for allegedly seeking to upend the results of the 2020 election in a concerted effort that led to the violent January 6 attack on the US Capitol by his supporters.

Trump also faces federal charges for alleged mishandling of top secret documents after he left the White House, and has been indicted for racketeering in Georgia on accusations that he tried to overturn the 2020 election results in the southern state.","{'uri': 'dailymail.co.uk', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'Daily Mail Online'}",[],https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2023/11/17/03/77914567-0-image-m-39_1700193034919.jpg,eng-9065743,-0.4588235294117647,25,25,Daily Mail Online,dailymail.co.uk

Adani faces renewed pressure after Hindenburg report of January

By Arpan Chaturvedi and Aditya Kalra

NEW DELHI, Nov 17 (Reuters) - Indian investigators are seeking to restart a probe into Adani Group for alleged overvaluation of coal imports and have asked the Supreme Court to allow them to collect evidence from Singapore, a step they say the company thwarted for years, legal documents show.

The Directorate of Revenue Intelligence since 2016 has been trying to procure transaction documents related to Adani's dealings from Singapore authorities. The agency suspects many of the group's coal shipments imported from Indonesian suppliers were first billed at higher prices on paper to its Singapore unit, Adani Global Pte, and then to its Indian arms.

Adani Enterprises and its subsidiaries, led by billionaire Gautam Adani, have successfully mounted repeated legal challenges in India and Singapore to block the documents' release, court papers show. Adani has denied wrongdoing, saying that Indian authorities assessed its coal shipments before releasing them from ports.

In an Oct. 9 legal filing, which Reuters is reporting for the first time, the revenue intelligence agency asked India's Supreme Court to quash a previous lower court order that allowed Adani to block authorities from collecting evidence from Singapore.

The Indian officials dispute Adani's arguments that the agency did not follow ""due process"", saying in the filing it had approval to seek information from the Southeast Asian city-state under a mutual legal assistance treaty.

""Permission for following this route was obtained from the Ministry of Finance as well as (the) Ministry of Home Affairs,"" the 25-page filing states, adding that the investigation ""is completely in compliance"".

In a statement to Reuters, Adani Group said it had ""fully co-operated"" with the authorities by providing details and documents sought more than four years ago and that ""no deficiency or objection"" was communicated by investigators thereafter.

The Indian revenue agency did not respond to Reuters' queries.

The effort to revive the coal probe comes amid wider regulatory scrutiny of Adani since Hindenburg Research in January accused the tycoon and his conglomerate of improper use of tax havens and stock manipulation.

Despite Adani's denials, the short seller's report triggered a $150 billion plunge in the group's stocks. India's Supreme Court is also overseeing the market regulator's probe of Hindenburg's allegations.

Amid the fallout and ahead of India's 2024 election, political opponents have increased pressure on Prime Minister Narendra Modi's administration, accusing it of favouritism toward Adani in government decisions.

Modi and Adani, who both hail from Gujarat, have denied impropriety.

The revenue agency began looking into Adani's imports as part of a broader investigation into 40 companies that started in 2014. Investigators alleged the companies importing Indonesian coal were overinvoicing deliveries by showing bills of shipments routed through intermediaries in Singapore and elsewhere.

Indian authorities reviewed 1,300 shipments involving Adani and alleged in court filings that it ""grossly overstated"" or ""artificially inflated the import value of coal"" as compared with the export value from Indonesia, ""with the objective of siphoning off"" funds to tax havens and charging higher power prices in India.

The sums involved may run into billions of rupees, according to the agency, which has not identified any Indonesian supplier.

BATTLE IN SINGAPORE

The evidence India is seeking from Singapore authorities, which includes transaction documents from 20 of Adani's banks there, could help establish a financial trail in the case, a person with direct knowledge of the matter told Reuters.

If India's Supreme Court allows the agency's latest request, it would then need to seek an order from Singapore's Court of Appeal to release the material.

The Singapore court declined requests from Reuters last month to inspect related case documents, saying in written responses that the files were sealed.

But a Reuters review of hundreds of pages of Indian court filings and orders reveal a tussle between India and Adani that stretched from Mumbai to New Delhi to Singapore in recent years.

In 2019, on Adani's challenge, the High Court of Mumbai cited procedural lapses in quashing the request by Indian investigators to collect evidence against Adani.

Days later, the agency appealed to the Supreme Court, which put the Mumbai verdict on hold ""until further orders"", which the agency contended in a subsequent Supreme Court filing meant ""the investigation could be continued"".

But the Singapore court in late 2020, after Adani's request, said the documents should not be released for now because India's top court had not reached a final decision, according to two people with direct knowledge of the matter and a Reuters review of legal orders.

In a statement to Reuters, the office of Singapore Attorney-General Lucien Wong said the Singapore court had not opined on the merits of Adani's appeals and the case was still pending.

The stance adopted by Adani's companies in Singapore ""created impediments"" and the investigation ""remains stalled"", the revenue agency told India's Supreme Court in 2021 filings.

The case was not heard for around two years, until the agency told the Supreme Court in July that it wanted to update judges about certain events in Singapore, without elaborating. It then lodged its October filing in a fresh bid to obtain evidence.

The next hearing is scheduled for Feb. 6.

The Minneapolis Police Department has lost more than 300 officers since 2018.

Last week, Police Chief Brian O'Hara and Frey announced an agreement for $15,000 recruitment bonuses and $18,000 retention bonuses.

The council voted to not even consider their plan and it left the police chief beside himself.

""We are at such a critical point. This is really beyond words,"" O'Hara said.

One reason why it's so difficult to rebuild MPD's ranks: New numbers from a statewide police union shows the city of Blaine is number one in starting pay. Minneapolis is number 18 in starting pay.

New cops in Blaine make about $93,000 a year. In Minneapolis, they make about $71,000 a year.

""You can't play politics with public safety. You have too many people dying,"" O'Hara said.

On top of recruiting cops, keeping them is even harder. Minneapolis ranks 21st for paying veteran officers.

Number one is Inver Grove Heights, which pays its top officers $112,000 a year. Minneapolis pays its top officers $103,000 a year.

It's a lot less pay for working in a much bigger city with a lot more crime -- it's hard for O'Hara to comprehend.

""You have too many victims of violent crime and one of the lowest staffed police department of any city in America,"" O'Hara said.

The Minneapolis pay bonuses would be paid over a three-year period.","{'uri': 'cbsnews.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'CBS News'}",[],https://assets2.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2023/06/17/42b0fb33-abc4-4314-98fe-b10f7da3c024/thumbnail/1200x630/946b5722a070b15cf691707b6efb81db/cbsn-fusion-minneapolis-police-have-history-of-bias-beyond-george-floyd-killing-doj-says-thumbnail-2057801-640x360.jpg?v=0468e1acbdfcea10e0b300333bc497c4,,-0.003921568627450966,25,25,CBS News,cbsnews.com

A Tennessee man was arrested Saturday after allegedly driving a tractor train made to cart children around, while under the influence and in possession of meth, according to reports.

ABC station WATE reported that several people, including officers with the Tazewell Police Department, turned their attention to ""Santa's Train,"" when the conductor, identified as 40-year-old Henry Meade, began acting erratically.

The Tazewell Police Department said Mead was driving a riding lawnmower that was converted into a train made to pull two carts behind it.

The train was intended to give families rides during the Christmas Tractor Parade in Tazewell, which ran down Main Street.

When officers approached Meade, he was reportedly unsteady on his feet.

A further investigation determined Meade was under the influence, police said. He was ultimately taken into custody, and a search discovered he was in possession of a syringe, methamphetamine and other narcotics.

Meade has been charged with DUI, possession of methamphetamine, possession of narcotics, and possession of drug paraphernalia.

He was booked into the Claiborne County Jail, and as of Thursday, was still behind bars.

In a Facebook post, the Tazewell Police Department and the city's mayor, Bill Fannon, addressed Saturday night's incident.

The police department added that there were 14 police officers on foot patrol for several thousands of attendees, and just like any day and any time, public safety was paramount.

The Placer County Sheriff's Office said those suspects are connected to an international theft group.

The call first came in as an attempted burglary on Bella Terra Place in Granite Bay. After a short pursuit by the Placer County sheriff's deputies, the suspects eventually led authorities on a chase that crossed into Sacramento County, where they reportedly topped speeds of 100 miles per hour.

Overhead video from a Sacramento County Sheriff's Office helicopter follows the suspects to the backyard of a home near Gerber Road in south Sacramento. A sheriff's K9 unit was deployed in the backyard of a home, and deputies arrested the suspects.

During the apprehension, both suspects were identified by visas they had in their possession - turned out they were fake identities.

The suspects were identified by their fingerprints as Placido Lopez-Vargas and Angel Emmanuel. Both, according to Placer County Sheriff Wayne Woo, are associated with South American theft groups.

""These organized crime groups from another country are now in our county,"" Sheriff Woo said.

In fact, the sheriff says the Granite Bay community has been plagued with burglaries for the last year.

""In excess of 20 burglaries, we think, were committed by this same group with losses totaling over a million dollars,"" Sheriff Woo said.

In July, CBS13 covered a string of home burglaries that all happened on the same day in upscale neighborhoods in Granite Bay and Sacramento.

""There's a lot of anger. There's a lot of grief,"" one of the homeowners affected by the July burglaries said.

Investigators say these burglaries are targeted.

""We have evidence leading us to believe that these groups traveled specifically from Southern California to the Placer County area,"" Sheriff Woo said.

He is now urging his Placer County residents to stay vigilant as his agency, in coordination with other jurisdictions, works to find whoever is responsible and hold them accountable.

The Contra Costa County District Attorney's Office and the Bay Area Air Quality Management District on Thursday jointly announced a common civil enforcement action that also includes the California Department of Fish and Wildlife and Contra Costa County Health.

All the agencies have notices of violation and enforcement referrals against MRC. They're working with the refinery to reach an acceptable penalty for the Thanksgiving night 2022 release, as well as at least three smaller chemical releases the past year.

""The goal of this joint effort with the air district is to achieve a resolution that ensures environmental compliance, and to rebuild and foster a safer community for the residents of Martinez,"" Contra Costa County District Attorney Diana Becton said.

""We welcome the opportunity to work collaboratively with the Contra Costa County District Attorney's Office as we take a comprehensive approach to ensure MRC's compliance with all air quality regulations,"" said Alexander Crockett, chief counsel of the air district. ""This partnership combines our prosecutorial resources to help ensure we achieve the best possible results for the residents of Martinez.""

About 9:30 p.m. on Nov. 24, 2022, the refinery released an estimated 20 to 24 tons of ""spent catalyst"" into the surrounding community until the following morning, when residents found their yards and vehicles covered in metallic dust.

The refinery failed to alert the county health department and the community warning system, both of which are legally mandated within 15 minutes of a release.

County health officials didn't find out about the release until the following Saturday when alerted to social media posts about the dust.

Initial testing of the Thanksgiving release showed the dust contained elevated levels of aluminum, barium, chromium, nickel, vanadium and zinc, all of which can cause respiratory problems.

The refinery has since apologized and told the City of Martinez it has taken 11 specific corrective actions: two associated with equipment, six associated with refinery procedures, and three associated with better training.

The refinery has also been involved in three smaller releases of ""coke dust"" that occurred since July. Coke dust is a byproduct of oil refining. The first release, on July 11, lasted less than a minute and created steam with coke dust, which was carried into the community by wind.

The second release was on July 22 and was contained on-site. The third release happened Oct. 6 and was termed by refinery officials as ""brief.""

Julian Assange is fighting extradition to the US for violating its 1917 Espionage Act, while in the UK a strict national security regime also prevails

Since the national security law for Hong Kong was enacted in 2020, it has more than proved its worth. It has not only ensured the survival of the “one country, two systems” policy, but also restored the city’s equilibrium.

Its success was such that, in 2022, President Xi Jinping made it clear that one country, two systems, which the Sino-British Joint Declaration of 1984 envisaged lasting for 50 years, “must be adhered to over the long run”.

Although the national security law is heavy on human rights, Western countries often demonise it. Despite having tough national security regimes of their own, they reacted to the enactment of the law for Hong Kong.

The United States, for example, ended the city’s trading preferences and handicapped its exports, banning “Made in Hong Kong” labelling. The United Kingdom urged British judges to resign from Hong Kong’s Court of Final Appeal, pressured a British barrister into withdrawing from a prosecution, and suspended its fugitive surrender agreement with Hong Kong.

Although British Foreign Secretary James Cleverly claimed in September that the national security law “continues to undermine Hong Kong’s legal and judicial systems”, this is not how its operators see things.

Since the enactment of the law, the judiciary has skilfully interpreted its provisions in a way that respects common law traditions. Indeed, in 2021, the Court of Final Appeal noted that “it is evident that the legislative intention is for the [national security law] to operate in tandem with the laws of the [Hong Kong special administrative region], seeking ‘convergence, compatibility and complementarity’ with local laws”.

When the highest court’s latest overseas recruit, Patrick Keane, former chief justice of the Federal Court of Australia, was appointed a non-permanent judge earlier this year, he noted “how successful” the court has been in “upholding the rule of law”. The Court of Final Appeal, he said, had a long history as “a very successful institution that’s made an important contribution to the success of Hong Kong”. It is a pity that the US lawmakers who have sought to sanction some of its judges were not listening.

In 2021, moreover, when British jurists faced pressure to resign as non-permanent Court of Final Appeal judges, one of them, Lord Sumption, rightly explained that the national security law contains “guarantees of human rights”.

The law not only stipulates in Article 4 that “human rights shall be respected and protected in safeguarding national security”, but also that the provisions of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) “shall be protected in accordance with the law”. The covenant is also applicable under Article 39 of the Basic Law.

Among those rights is the right to a fair trial. This includes access to legal counsel, the presumption of innocence, the testing of prosecution witnesses, the giving and calling of evidence, and conviction only when guilt is proved beyond reasonable doubt.A most severe national security law you will have never heard of

Despite this, foreign critics of the national security law have complained about the limitations on jury trials in national security cases (as where jurors face intimidation), restrictions on overseas lawyers taking part in such cases (due to the risk of state secrets being leaked), and the law’s extraterritorial reach (designed to protect Hong Kong from foreign dangers).

Yet the critics have little to say about other national security regimes, however draconian.

In Singapore, for example, the Internal Security Act is far harsher. Not only has trial by jury been abolished altogether, but Singapore has never signed the ICCPR. Unlike Hong Kong, it retains the death penalty, and national security suspects can be detained by executive order without trial for up to two years, which can be extended.

In the US, a battery of laws have dealt with national security, including the Patriot Act (2001). In suspected terrorism cases, the act weakened privacy rights by allowing the government access to people’s telephone records without court authorisation. Although the act was reformed by the Freedom Act (2015), which was supposed to end bulk surveillance, the National Security Agency still collected large amounts of data.

In the UK, WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange, incarcerated since April 2019, is fighting extradition to the US for allegedly, while outside the US, contravening its Espionage Act (1917).

Assange’s WikiLeaks revealed how at Guantanamo Bay, the US military prison in Cuba for terror suspects, new prisoners were held in isolation to soften them up before what was euphemistically called “enhanced interrogation”. The New York Times says that since 2002, about 780 prisoners have been held at Guantanamo Bay, of whom 30 remain. Some have been held for years without due process, with little or no complaint from Britain and its partners.

In the UK, a strict national security regime also prevails, including the National Security Act (2023). Its sweeping provisions create new espionage and sabotage offences, curb the pre-trial rights of suspects, and give the police intrusive search powers. Unlike the national security law for Hong Kong, it does not incorporate the ICCPR. It was denounced in Parliament for its “chilling effect” on investigative journalism, and the Campaign for Freedom of Information called it “oppressive and disproportionate”.

Since 2003, moreover, it has been possible for British judges to dispense with juries if there is a serious risk of jury tampering, yet the critics only complain when this happens in Hong Kong. Even though foreign lawyers are generally barred from British courts, the critics fret over Hong Kong restrictions on overseas lawyers in national security trials.

To be credible, Western powers need to end their double standards. The national security law has been wisely applied by an independent judiciary, and its prioritisation of human rights distinguishes it from less liberal national security regimes elsewhere.

Florida had asked the court to allow its anti-drag show law to be enforced everywhere except at the Hamburger Mary's restaurant in Orlando, which challenged the law's constitutionality

Hamburger Mary's challenge alleged the law 'prohibits protected speech based on the identity of the speaker' and is vague and overbroad.

The district court found that the law likely restricted free speech and couldn't be enforced anywhere in the state.

Hamburger Mary´s regularly hosts drag shows, including family-friendly performances on Sundays that children are invited to attend.

The restaurant´s owner said the law was overly broad, was written vaguely and violated First Amendment rights by chilling speech.

The new law championed by Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis, who is running for the 2024 GOP presidential nomination, punished venues for allowing children into what it called 'adult live performances.'

Though it did not mention drag shows specifically, the sponsor of the legislation said it was aimed at those performances.

Venues that violated the law faced fines and the possibility that their liquor licenses to be suspended or revoked. Individuals could be charged with a misdemeanor crime.

The new law prevents venues from allowing children admission to 'any show, exhibition, or other presentation that is performed in front of a live audience and in whole or in part, depicts or simulates nudity, sexual conduct, sexual excitement, specific sexual activities, ... lewd conduct, or the lewd exposure of prosthetic or imitation genitals or breasts.'

If venues were found to have violated the law regulators would be able to suspend of revoke their licenses.

Presnell, who was appointed to the bench by President Bill Clinton in 2000, said the so-called Protection of Children law, was 'specifically designed to suppress the speech of drag queen performers' and that the state 'already has statutes that provide' protection from obscene behavior.

The judge said the law was ill-defined and 'vulnerable to broad subjectivity.'

'A fully clothed drag queen with cleavage-displaying prosthetic breasts reading an age-appropriate story to children may be adjudged 'wicked' -- and thus 'lewd' -- by some, but such a scenario would not constitute the kind of obscene conduct prohibited by the statutes' in previous case law, Presnell wrote in the 24 page judgement.

Presnell also drew attention to issues raised by the focus on 'prosthetic or imitation genitals or breasts.'

Presnell said the law also clashed with the 'Parents' Bill of Rights' and other laws.'

A New York judge has lifted the gag order imposed on former President Donald Trump in his civil fraud trial stemming from state Attorney General Letitia James' lawsuit against him and the Trump Organization.

Citing concerns over free speech, appeals court Judge David Friedman issued a stay on the order Thursday, which was put in place by Judge Arthur Engoran in October.

Engoron, who is overseeing Trump's trial, imposed the partial gag order to block all parties from making derogatory statements about his court staff. He fined Trump $5,000 for violating the order on social media on Oct. 20, and did so again on Oct. 25 for another $10,000 before threatening imprisonment if further violations were committed.

JUDGE IN TRUMP'S GEORGIA ELECTION INTERFERENCE CASE ORDERS 'SENSITIVE' EVIDENCE WITHHELD FROM PUBLIC

At Thursday's emergency hearing, Friedman questioned Engoron's authority to limit Trump's speech outside the courtroom, and argued gag orders were used more in criminal trials where there is a fear of swaying a jury. The ruling also applies to Trump's lawyers, who say they have no plans to inhibit the former president's First Amendment rights.

Trump celebrated the ruling in a post on Truth Social, in which he railed against Engoran.

""Judge Arthur Engoron has just been overturned (stayed!) by the New York State Appellate Division (Appeals Court), for the 4th TIME (on the same case!). His Ridiculous and Unconstitutional Gag Order, not allowing me to defend myself against him and his politically biased and out of control, Trump Hating Clerk, who is sinking him and his Court to new levels of LOW, is a disgrace,"" he wrote.

Trump reiterated that he did ""nothing wrong,"" and again accused James of having run on a ""Get Trump"" platform during her campaign.

The U.S. Supreme Court denied Florida's request on Thursday to reinstate its anti-drag law, marking a victory for opponents of the legislation.

Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis signed a law in May that punishes venues if they allow people younger than 18 to attend ""adult live performances"" that contain sexually explicit or lewd content, including exposure to ""prosthetic genitals and breasts."" The businesses could face fines of $10,000, the loss of their business and liquor licenses, and criminal penalties for not complying.

Though the legislation doesn't explicitly name drag performances, the sponsor of the bill said that it targeted drag performances.

The law was challenged in May by Hamburger Mary's, a bar and grill in Orlando that frequently hosts family-friendly drag shows.

In a lawsuit against the state and DeSantis, the business argued that the law was a violation of free speech and that its phrasing was ""vague and indistinct.""

In June, a federal judge sided with Hamburger Mary's and issued a preliminary order blocking the law from taking full effect. The state of Florida appealed the court's ruling to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 11th District, which is still pending.

Florida Attorney General Ashley Moody filed a stay motion to the 11th Circuit, asking that it limit the injunction to apply only to Hamburger Mary's rather than to all establishments in the state during the appeal process.

After the motion was denied by a divided 11th Circuit panel, the state turned to the U.S. Supreme Court to request that the law be reinstated. In a motion filed to the higher court, Moody said that ""Florida is now unable to enforce its statute at all, to the detriment of Florida's children and the State's sovereign prerogative to protect them from harm"" as a result of the injunction.

According to The Washington Post, the restaurant's attorney Donald A. Donati urged the Supreme Court not to allow the law to take effect, pointing out that Florida already has laws that prevent children from viewing sexually explicit material.

Donati added that Hamburger Mary's drag shows are ""not harmful to minors"" but that restaurant owners are worried about being prosecuted for violating the law because of its broad and vague language.

On Thursday, the Supreme Court also refused to reinstate the law with a vote of 6-3, NPR reported. In a statement explaining the decision, Justice Brett Kavanaugh and Justice Amy Coney Barrett said that the decision does not reflect their own views on whether the law violates the First Amendment but that the state didn't raise the issue in its filings to the court.

The three dissenting justices, Clarence Thomas, Samuel Alito and Neil Gorsuch, indicated that they would have allowed the law to take effect.

HuffPost reached out to Moody's and DeSantis' offices for comment but did not receive an immediate response.

""Considering the constitutional and statutory rights at issue an interim stay is granted,"" wrote Associate Justice David Friedman, of New York state's intermediate appeals court.

He issued the stay in response to a request filed by Trump's legal team earlier this week that argued the gag order violated his First-Amendment -- as well as the state's -- freedom-of-speech rights.

The gag order on the former president was imposed by Judge Arthur Engoron after a derogatory post appeared on Trump's Truth Social platform. He has fined Trump twice since then for violations, most recently for $10,000 after he made a remark outside the courtroom that Engoron concluded was made in reference to the judge's principal law clerk, Allison Greenfield.

Friedman's order also grants temporary relief to Trump's attorneys, who have also been prohibited by Judge Engoron from discussing his communications with his staff.

Trump posted about the ruling on his social media site Thursday, once again targeting Engoron and Greenfield.

""His Ridiculous and Unconstitutional Gag Order, not allowing me to defend myself against him and his politically biased and out of control, Trump Hating Clerk, who is sinking him and his Court to new levels of LOW, is a disgrace,"" Trump wrote.

In a written order, Engoron wrote that Trump's attorneys have made ""repeated, inappropriate remarks about my Principal Law Clerk, falsely accusing her of bias against them and of improperly influencing"" the trial.

""Defendants' attorneys have made long speeches alleging that it is improper for a judge to consult with a law clerk during ongoing proceedings, and that the passing of notes from a judge to a law clerk, or vice-versa, constitutes an improper 'appearance of impropriety' in this case,"" he wrote. ""These arguments have no basis.""

On Wednesday, attorneys for Trump requested a mistrial be declared in the case, claiming the judge and his clerk have subjected the defendants to ""tangible and overwhelming"" bias and unfair treatment.

The motion for a mistrial makes good on a promise Trump's attorneys made to file it the day he testified in the case on Nov. 6. The announcement capped off an intense day of examination in which Trump -- who has frequently criticized Engoron and Greenfield -- even lashed out at the judge on the witness stand, pointing at him and calling him a ""fraud.""

Engoron is overseeing the case brought by New York Attorney General Letitia James against Trump, his two oldest sons, the Trump Organization and several executives in New York State Supreme Court in Manhattan. James' office alleges the defendants orchestrated a decade-long fraud scheme to inflate the value of the company's properties and Trump's personal wealth. Engoron has already found the Trumps and their company liable for business fraud.

The trial, which is related to other allegations in the suit, is currently in its seventh week.

Gambia argued that it and Burma are both parties to the 1948 convention outlawing genocide and that all signatories have a duty to ensure it is enforced. It asked the court to declare Burma in breach of the convention.

The court has already ruled it has jurisdiction, though hearings in the case have not been scheduled.

Burma tried unsuccessfully to have the case thrown out, arguing the world court can only hear disputes between nations and Gambia was acting on behalf of the Organization of Islamic Cooperation.

The judges also dismissed Burma's claim that Gambia could not file the case as it was not directly linked to the events in Burma and that a legal dispute did not exist between the two countries before the case was filed.

The letter signed by Senators Ted Budd, Mitch McConnell, John Thune and others said they had ""significant concerns about the justifications for and ramifications of this pause"" and said it ""puts at stake U.S. commercial and economic interests"" as well as U.S. national security and foreign policy.

Trump 'made his own bed,' cannot add witness for writer's trial - judge

A federal judge rejected Donald Trump's bid to add a new expert witness just two months before a trial addressing how much the former U.S. president owes for defaming the writer E. Jean Carroll, saying Trump ""made his own bed"" by waiting too long. Trump had claimed he would suffer ""extreme prejudice"" without a new damages expert for the scheduled Jan. 16, 2024, trial.

South Florida storm dumps more than a foot of rain

A fierce storm packing hurricane-force wind gusts dumped more than a foot (30.5 cm) of rain on parts of South Florida on Thursday, flooding homes and streets, downing power lines and trees and leaving tens of thousands of homes and business without power. The storm, which started on Wednesday, dropped almost 14 inches of rain from Key Largo to Fort Lauderdale while wind gusts topped out at 86 mph (136 kph), the U.S. National Service said on Thursday.

Pressure mounts on FDIC chief to resign after sexual misconduct report

A top U.S. banking regulator faced mounting pressure on Thursday over his handling of allegations of sexual misconduct among agency staff and accounts of his own past conduct, with Republican lawmakers calling for his resignation and vowing to conduct a thorough probe. The calls followed a Wall Street Journal report earlier this week that said the U.S. Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation had failed to eradicate widespread harassment in its workforce.

US Supreme Court keeps pause on Florida's ban on drag shows in front of kids

The U.S. Supreme Court on Thursday declined to revive a Florida law signed by Republican Governor Ron DeSantis banning the performance of ""lewd"" drag shows in the presence of children. The justices denied a request by Florida officials to narrow a judge's pause on the law to just a single plaintiff - an Orlando restaurant called Hamburger Mary's - rather than maintain his temporary statewide halt of the measure.

Senior US FDA official Woodcock to retire next year

U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Principal Deputy Commissioner Dr. Janet Woodcock, who led the regulator during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic as acting chief, plans to retire early next year, the agency said on Thursday. Woodcock, 75, is an FDA veteran who twice led its pharmaceutical division for at least a decade in each instance. There she reshaped the drug approval process, relaxing the criteria needed for certain drugs to reach the market.

Florida sued over ban on pro-Palestinian student groups

The American Civil Liberties Union challenged Florida's ban on pro-Palestinian university groups, arguing in a federal lawsuit on Thursday that the state is violating students' free speech as tensions roil U.S. campuses over Israel's war with Hamas. Florida´s university system, joined by Governor Ron DeSantis, last month ordered colleges to shut down chapters of Students for Justice in Palestine (SJP), a group at the center of U.S. campus activism since Hamas attacked Israel on Oct. 7.","{'uri': 'dailymail.co.uk', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'Daily Mail Online'}",[],,,-0.2627450980392156,25,25,Daily Mail Online,dailymail.co.uk

Then new ones formed.,"The suspensions didn't have their intended effect. New organizations quickly formed.

The emergence of new groups to supplant suspended ones is confounding colleges as they try to find a line between allowing protests that support a ceasefire in the Israel-Hamas war with those devolving into hate speech.

At Columbia, ""the suspension of those two groups is nothing more than a suppression of speech,"" said one Palestinian student who is a member of a new coalition, Columbia University Apartheid Divest, and declined to give his full name for fear of retribution.

Schools like Brown University and MIT have also disciplined students for expressing solidarity with Palestinians. The Biden administration, meanwhile, this week unveiled new actions and resources to address the rise in antisemitic and Islamophobic incidents at schools and on college campuses.

""For many years, we saw increasingly toxic environments on campus poisoned by anti-Israel and antisemitic rhetoric,"" said Kenneth Marcus, founder and chair of the Brandeis Center, a nonprofit that advances Jewish civil and human rights. ""But now, over the last month, we have seen student groups who are going so far as to provide support for a designated terrorist organization in the wake of atrocities that they have committed.""

Students, activists and free speech advocates are sounding the alarm on efforts to silence pro-Palestinian groups. And institutions are becoming more cognizant of that: Two of Florida's biggest universities have declined to deactivate Students for Justice in Palestine groups as requested by Gov. Ron DeSantis due to legal concerns.

The Students for Justice in Palestine chapter at one of those schools, the University of Florida, also sued the institution Thursday as well as the state, alleging that its First Amendment rights were being violated. But Republican lawmakers are also looking to take away scholarships and grants from Florida college students who ""promote"" Hamas and other designated terrorist organizations.

The American Civil Liberties Union wrote an open letter to roughly 650 college leaders to reject ""baseless calls to investigate or punish"" pro-Palestinian groups protesting on campuses. That came in response to a letter the American Defamation League and the Brandeis Center sent to nearly 200 college leaders urging them to probe Students for Justice in Palestine chapters.

Afaf Nasher, executive director of the New York chapter of the Council on American-Islamic Relations, the nation's largest Muslim civil rights group, called Columbia's decision ""the suppression and silencing of pro-Palestinian voices on campus.""

There was more pushback this week.

Thirteen bar associations representing more than 1,000 attorneys -- including the American Muslim Bar Association -- on Monday sent a letter to 100 of the country's top law firms urging them to address Islamophobia and hate speech.

The letter was a response to a missive law firms sent to law school deans requesting they address antisemitism.

The pro-Israel law firms' letter ""unfortunately missed the opportunity to equally express concern for members of the Palestinian and Muslim communities who have been experiencing significant discrimination, harassment, silencing, hate, violence, and fear in the current social climate,"" the Muslim groups wrote.

And the protests persist.

Law Students for a Free Palestine -- a coalition of students from over 30 law schools, including Harvard, Columbia, New York University and the City University of New York -- was holding a day of action Thursday to urge law schools to advocate for an end to violence in Gaza and support a ceasefire.

Student organizations at George Washington also established a new group, Student Coalition for Palestine.

Colleges' ability to crack down on protests, however, gets into a gray area of the law.

Lyrissa Lidsky, the chair of the constitutional law program at the University of Florida, said the Supreme Court has held that free speech is protected unless it falls in an unprotected category -- like material support of a foreign terrorist organization or incitement to imminent violent actions.

Some of the suspensions or banning of pro-Palestinian organizations are problematic because they're being prohibited solely for advocacy, she argued. But she cautioned private universities are not required to uphold the First Amendment in the same way as public schools.

""Brandeis can do what it wants, Columbia can do what it wants,"" Lidsky said in an interview. ""They may take a reputational hit from engaging in censorship and they may violate their expressed ideals, but they don't violate the First Amendment. But a state university like mine has to adhere to the First Amendment, and they can't suppress those groups just because they find their speech offensive.""

Institutions have targeted Students for Justice in Palestine long before the current conflict in the Middle East. Earlier this year, Lafayette College in Pennsylvania refused to recognize a local chapter over concerns the group's events could flout college policy by targeting other clubs on campus. Fordham University previously banned the group, too.

Amid an increase in threats, harassment and assaults -- including a 21-year-old Cornell University student arrested for making online threats to Jewish students -- schools have been facing pressure to take action.

Fareed, a student at Columbia's School of International and Public Affairs -- who asked to be identified by his first name for safety reasons -- said the tension in the school community is ""still polarizing,"" but accused outside actors of labeling the internal tension ""as more than what it is.""

""If Students for Justice in Palestine and Jewish Voice for [Peace] are shut down, then whatever perspective that they have -- correct or incorrect, depending on who's listening to it -- you lose that opportunity to have a real conversation,"" he said.

Brandeis' President Ron Liebowitz said last week it is committed to ensuring free speech, but the university ""may restrict expression ... that constitutes a genuine threat or harassment.""

And in a recent Boston Globe op-ed, he contended that student organizations that call for violence against Jews or the annihilation of Israel ""should lose all privileges associated with affiliation at their schools.""

In a statement, George Washington said Students for Justice in Palestine's actions violated university policies, including building use guidelines and non-compliance when it wouldn't stop projecting images on the library building.

In a joint statement last week, the Columbia chapters of Students for Justice in Palestine and Jewish Voice for Peace called the announcement ""an attack on free speech"" to distract from and enable ""Israel's genocidal campaign against the Palestinian people.""

Colleges are also under threat of losing state aid if they don't clamp down on hate speech, like what is being pursued in Florida.

New York state Sen. Bill Weber, a Republican, introduced legislation that would prohibit New York college students who knowingly engage in antisemitic behavior from receiving tuition assistance aid.

""There is no room for hate in New York, and it is our duty to put an end to this divisive behavior,"" he said.","{'uri': 'politico.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'POLITICO'}",[],https://static.politico.com/2c/7c/1bb6cac446f1a3c83bace64bb61e/ap23287817661676-1.jpg,eng-9065381,-0.1529411764705882,25,25,POLITICO,politico.com

Convicted criminals in New York will now have their records sealed after Gov. Kathy Hochul signed into law the ""Clean State Act"" on Thursday.

The controversial proposal would seal old criminal records as long as the perpetrators remain out of trouble for a certain number of years.

Under the new law in New York, a person's felony records would be sealed eight years after conviction or release from prison; three years for a misdemeanor.

Sex crimes and most Class A felonies, such as kidnapping or terrorism, will not be eligible for the program. The bill excludes class A felonies for drug possession.

During the signing of the controversial law, Gov. Hochul hailed the program for its potential to fight rising crime.

""The best crime-fighting tool is a good-paying job,"" Hochul said at the Brooklyn Museum on Thursday morning. ""That's why I support giving New Yorkers a clean slate after they've paid their debt to society and gone years without an additional offense.""

Melinda Agnew with the Center for Community Alternative said that the legislation will change lives.

""Twenty-six years after successfully completing my sentence, despite all that I have accomplished, I continue to have doors closed in my face,"" said Agnew.

The law, which will go into effect in one year, will still allow law enforcement, prosecutors, the Education Department, the courts and others to have access to perpetrators' records.

""I negotiated a compromise that protects public safety and boosts economic opportunity, and the final Clean Slate Law will help New Yorkers access jobs and housing while allowing police, prosecutors and school officials to protect their communities,"" Hochul said.

The governor said that the law hopes to address the worker shortage plaguing New York.

""And as our state faces a worker shortage, with more than 450,000 job openings right now, this new law will help businesses find more workers who will help them grow, expand and thrive,"" Hochul said.

The bill was passed by state lawmakers last June on a party-line vote.

Former New York Democratic Gov. David Paterson has denounced the law, saying that that while he thinks the ""intent"" was positive, he believes the measure is misguided.

""In theory, it works. But one of the problems we have in the state right now is you have people getting arrested 40, 50, 60 times.

Michigan State Police say Warren police officer fired shots. The man was taken to a hospital in serious condition. One officer suffered a non-fatal injury.

(AP) - The top health official in one of Michigan´s largest counties is asking a judge to uphold a $4 million settlement in exchange for her resignation, coming after months of conflict with local conservative leaders who were elected in response to COVID-19 restrictions.

Ottawa County leaders had attempted to fire Adeline Hambley in January after they took majority control of the county´s board of commissioners. Finding themselves unable to, the board opted to offer her $4 million - equivalent to a quarter of the health department´s 2024 budget - in return for her resignation. She also would have had to drop her lawsuit against the county.

The board backed off the offer, saying it was only a ""tentative settlement agreement."" David Kallman, the county's legal counsel, told The Associated Press that ""there has never been an agreement by the board to accept the $4 million. There were discussions.""

But Hambley's lawyer filed a motion Thursday to enforce the settlement, and it's scheduled to go in front of a judge on Nov. 27.

""The parties agreed to settle this matter on Nov. 6, 2023. Now, defendants have remorse and want out of the deal,"" Hambley´s lawyer, Sarah Riley-Howard, wrote in the filing.

Public health officials and local health departments across the country became political targets during the pandemic due to lockdowns and restrictions.

Ottawa County's health department serves 300,000 residents in the western part of the state. Earlier this year, county commissioners voted to cut the department´s upcoming budget by nearly $4 million. The board had threatened deeper cuts, and Hambley took to social media to protest.

The county's 11-member board of commissioners was transformed last year when eight incumbents were defeated by a slate of challengers tied closely to a group known as Ottawa Impact, which was formed in 2021 partly in response to mask mandates in the county.

Hambley sued the commissioners earlier this year for ""termination in violation of public policy."" In October, the state´s appeals court ruled Hambley could be fired only for ""just cause.""

But following a nearly eight-hour closed session at a Nov. 6 meeting, commissioners voted to ""accept counsel´s recommendation regarding litigation and settlement activities"" regarding Hambley. The settlement was later revealed to be $4 million, in return for Hambley´s resignation.

Hambley would work until at least Nov. 30 but no later than Dec. 15 under the agreement.

Nathaniel Kelly, a safety manager at an HVAC company and who has no public health experience, is in line to take over the county health department.

The county requested approval from the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services for Kelly to serve as acting health officer, but the state told the county it couldn´t appoint a health officer until a vacancy exists, according to a spokesperson with the department.

Telesforo Del Valle, 65, pleaded guilty to charges of conspiracy, bribery, paying illegal compensation to a court employee, and making material false statements to law enforcement to conceal his crimes. His trial had been set to begin on Dec. 4.

He potentially faces up to 15 years in prison. His sentencing has been scheduled for March 12, prosecutors said.

Prosecutors said Del Valle gave ""at least tens of thousands of dollars"" in payments to Dionisio Figueroa, who allegedly used his position as a clerk in the Southern District of New York court to encourage criminal defendants to hire Del Valle instead of using free, court-appointed counsel.

""The public relies on attorneys and court employees to maintain and validate its faith in our criminal justice system,"" Manhattan U.S. Attorney Damian Williams said in a statement. Del Valle betrayed that trust, he added.

Del Valle's lawyer did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Figueroa, 66, was also charged and is still scheduled to go to trial on Dec. 4, according to federal court records.

""Mr. Del Valle has great lawyers, and I am sure his own reasons for pleading guilty just as Mr. Figueroa has his reasons for vigorously pursuing his innocence at a trial,"" Paul Evangelista and Jeremy Sporn, federal public defenders representing Figueroa, said in an email.

Figueroa allegedly referred at least 45 criminal defendants to Del Valle as possible clients from 2011 to 2022, and at least 20 ended up retaining him. In return, Del Valle gave Figueroa referral payments in cash, prosecutors said.

Prosecutors alleged Figueroa vouched for Del Valle when talking with defendants or their families as they appeared in court.

Figueroa was charged with conspiracy to bribe a federal employee and pay illegal compensation to a judicial employee, bribery of a federal employee, illegal compensation to a judicial employee, and making false statements to law enforcement.

Donald Trump got his New York gag order lifted while he challenges it on appeal, meaning that, at least for now, he's free from such restraints in both his civil fraud case and the federal election interference case in Washington.

The lifting by a New York state appellate judge on Thursday follows a similar move from the federal appeals court in D.C. that's considering Trump's gag order there. Oral arguments are set for Monday at the Washington appeals court, and the gag orders could wind up reinstated in both cases after more litigation plays out.

It's worth noting that the New York order imposed by Judge Arthur Engoron was more limited than the one in D.C. The New York order applies specifically to comments about court staff, sparked by Trump's social media posting about Engoron's law clerk, whom Trump and his lawyers have contrived as a foil in the $250 million fraud case that threatens his business empire. Engoron has already fined Trump twice for violating the gag order, for a relatively meager $15,000 total, and later extended the order to Trump's lawyers. The pause applies to both Trump and his lawyers.

Again, this is a temporary measure, so we don't know how this will conclude on appeal.

Austin Lee Edwards, 28, died by suicide during a shootout with law enforcement on Nov. 25, hours after the violence in Riverside, a city about 50 miles (80 kilometers) southeast of downtown Los Angeles. The teenager was rescued.

Edwards had been hired as a Washington County sheriff's deputy in Virginia just nine days before the killings, even though a 2016 court order prohibited him from buying, possessing and transporting a firearm. The court order stemmed from a psychiatric detention after Edwards cut himself and threatened to kill his father.

The girl´s aunt, Mychelle Blandin, and her minor sister filed the lawsuit Thursday in federal court in the Central District of California against the Washington County Sheriff´s Office and Edwards´ estate. The lawsuit says the department was negligent in hiring Edwards and seeks damages through a jury trial. The sheriff's office did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Authorities have said Edwards had posed online as a 17-year-old boy while communicating with the teenager, a form of deception known as ""catfishing,"" and asked her to send nude photos of herself.

The girl stopped responding to his messages, prompting Edwards to travel across the country to her home in California. The lawsuit alleges that he showed his law enforcement badge and service weapon to Mark Winek and Sharon Winek, the girl's grandparents, and said he was a detective and needed to question the family.

The suit says Edwards slit the throat of the teen's mother, Brooke Winek, and tried to asphyxiate her grandparents by tying them up with bags over their heads. At least one of them was still moving when he set their home on fire, the lawsuit says.

Blandin said the killings ""destroyed our family.""

""I am bringing this lawsuit because my family wants to know how Edwards was hired as a sheriff´s deputy and given a gun when the courts expressly ordered he could not possess a firearm,"" Blandin said in a statement. ""He used his position as a sheriff to gain access to my parents´ home, where he killed them and my sister. I want the Washington County Sheriff´s Office held accountable for giving a mentally unfit person a badge and a gun.""

Edwards was hired by the Virginia State Police in July 2021 and resigned nine months later. He was then hired as a deputy in Washington County last year.

The slayings - and their connection to Virginia - prompted Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin to ask the state´s inspector general for a ""full investigation,"" which found that a background investigator for the state police failed to check the correct database that would have pulled up the mental health order.

The state police, which is not listed as a defendant in the lawsuit, has since changed its employment processes and background investigation policies and training.

A spokesperson for the state police did not immediately respond to a request for comment Thursday.","{'uri': 'dailymail.co.uk', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'Daily Mail Online'}",[],,eng-9069061,-0.4431372549019608,25,25,Daily Mail Online,dailymail.co.uk

Please try again later{{ /verifyErrors }}

Sacked home secretary Suella Braverman has been accused of wanting to do 'what Putin and Xi do' in her latest bid to ensure deportation flights to Rwanda can take off.

Mrs Braverman, dismissed during a reshuffle this week, has said the prime minister's proposals to overcome the Supreme Court's verdict that the Rwanda policy is unlawful is unlikely to succeed in removing asylum seekers before the next election.

She predicts Mr Sunak's two-part plan would likely get bogged down in both domestic and European courts as she proposed introducing legislation that ""excludes all avenues of legal challenge"".

In an article for The Daily Telegraph, Mrs Braverman said a 'solution' to the challenge of stopping migrants crossing the English Channel ""demands of the Government an end to self-deception and spin"".

""There must be no more magical thinking,"" she writes. ""Tinkering with a failed plan will not stop the boats.""

Mrs Braverman argues that ""amending our agreement with Rwanda and converting it into a treaty, even with explicit obligations on non-refoulement, will not solve the fundamental issue"".

Instead, she proposes that ministers address concerns raised by the five senior judges about Rwanda's asylum and legal system by ""embedding UK observers and independent reviewers of asylum decisions"".

New legislation should be laid in Westminster to ""exclude all avenues of legal challenge"" so that international obligations, such as the Human Rights Act and the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR), are ""disapplied by way of clear 'notwithstanding clauses'"", she said.

The right-wing Conservative also suggested Parliament sit over Christmas to ensure the new emergency law can be passed before next year. The Fareham MP said a new treaty with Rwanda would ""still require going back through the courts"", a process that she predicted could take at least a year.

And even a victory in domestic courts would only mean the ""saga would simply relocate to Strasbourg where the European court would take its time deciding if it liked our laws"", she added.

""That is why the plan outlined by the PM will not yield flights to Rwanda before an election if Plan B is simply a tweaked version of the failed Plan A,"" said the former Home Office chief.

Her proposals were quickly met with criticism, even from her own party, as the Conservatives continue to be divided by her hardline approach.

MP Ashford for Damian Green wrote on X on Thursday evening: ""The second test is the most unconservative statement I have ever heard from a Conservative politician. Giving the state the explicit power to override every legal constraint is what Putin and Xi do. We absolutely cannot go there.""

Mr Sunak's response to the Supreme Court judgment on Wednesday saw him announce that his administration plans to lay down emergency legislation to have Parliament deem Rwanda a ""safe"" country.

He also intends to broker a new legally binding treaty on top of the £140 million deal already struck with Kigali to take migrants arriving in Britain via small boats.

The yet-to-be-published treaty with Rwanda is expected to attempt to address the Supreme Court's concerns around refoulement - the potential for refugees whose applications for asylum are rejected by Kigali to be sent back to the country they are fleeing from.","{'uri': 'independent.co.uk', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'The Independent'}",[],https://static.independent.co.uk/2023/11/16/22/eb0e62080d81a6218a6846677863435dY29udGVudHNlYXJjaGFwaSwxNzAwMjU4NTk4-2.71422272.jpg?quality=75&width=1200&auto=webp,eng-9063836,0.003921568627450966,25,25,The Independent,independent.co.uk

""That is why the plan outlined by the PM will not yield flights to Rwanda before an election if Plan B is simply a tweaked version of the failed Plan A,"" said the former Home Office chief.

The Prime Minister has said he is aiming for the first removal flights to leave in the spring following the delivery of the reforms to his flagship policy.

But Chancellor Jeremy Hunt refused to commit to migrants who arrive via unauthorised means being sent to the east African country in 2024.

Speaking to broadcasters on Thursday, Mr Hunt said: ""We are hopeful that because of the solutions that the Prime Minister announced yesterday we will be able to get flights off to Rwanda next year.

""We can't guarantee that.""

New Home Secretary James Cleverly, during broadcast interviews on Thursday, said he was ""absolutely determined"" to get a removal flight off the runway before the next election.

A general election is expected to be held next year, with Mr Sunak needing to call a vote by January 2025.

The British leader has made ""stopping the boats"" one of his five pledges to the electorate ahead of the next election.

The threat of being deported to Rwanda has been regularly touted by the Conservative Party leader and other senior Government figures as one of the ways that can help deliver the commitment.

The new treaty with Kigali could be published as soon as Monday, with the emergency legislation tabled a week later, according to The Guardian.

The Government's next steps on the Rwanda policy is expected to face opposition to its plans in the House of Lords.

Lord Sumption, a former Supreme Court judge, told the BBC the plan to use a law to declare Rwanda as safe is ""constitutionally really quite extraordinary"" and would ""effectively overrule"" a decision by the UK's highest court.

Under pressure from the right of the party, Mr Sunak has kept the threat of pulling out of the ECHR on the table for the future in his battle to deport migrants.

Mrs Braverman, however, did not call for such action in her five tests.","{'uri': 'dailymail.co.uk', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'Daily Mail Online'}",[],https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2023/11/16/22/wire-77906215-1700175230-621_636x382.jpg,eng-9063836,0.1607843137254903,25,25,Daily Mail Online,dailymail.co.uk

Please try again later{{ /verifyErrors }}

The Republican attorney general in Kansas is appealing a state judge's ruling that has blocked enforcement of multiple abortion restrictions, including a new limit on medication and an older rule forcing patients to wait 24 hours before they can get the procedure.

Attorney General Kris Kobach filed a notice Thursday in Johnson County District Court in the Kansas City area, saying he will ask higher courts to overturn Judge K. Christopher Jayaram's decision last month. The judge concluded that abortion providers were likely to successfully argue in a lawsuit that the restrictions violate the Kansas Constitution.

""The attorney general has a responsibility to protect women against radicals who want to deny them the ability to make informed decisions about their own health and the welfare of their babies,"" Kobach spokesperson Danedri Herbert said in an email.

Jayaram's order is set to remain in effect through a trial of the providers' lawsuit at the end of June 2024. Some of the blocked restrictions have been in place for years. The state imposed its waiting period in 1997.

The newest restriction, in place July 1, required providers to tell patients that a medication abortion can be stopped. But the regimen to do that has been described by major medical groups as inadequately tested, ineffective and potentially unsafe.

The legal battle in Kansas highlights the importance of state courts in attempts to preserve access after the U.S. Supreme Court's decision in Dobbs v. Jackson last year ended protections under the U.S. Constitution and allowed states to ban abortion.

The Kansas Supreme Court ruled in 2019 that the state constitution protects access to abortion as a ""fundamental"" right. In August 2022, voters statewide rejected a proposed constitutional change from Republican lawmakers to nullify that decision and allow greater restrictions or a ban.

Abortion opponents argue that even with last year's vote, the state can impose ""reasonable"" restrictions and ensure that patients are well-informed.

But Jayaram concluded there is ""credible evidence"" that up to 40% of the information that clinics were required to provide before an abortion was medically inaccurate.

""Kansans made it clear they don't want politicians interfering with their health care decisions and the courts reaffirmed that right,"" said Anamarie Rebori-Simmons, spokesperson for Planned Parenthood Great Plains, which operates a Kansas City-area clinic that sued.

The 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals threw out a 3-2 decision issued last year by the National Labor Relations Board, which had said Tesla couldn´t prohibit union attire. The court opinion noted that Tesla allowed workers to affix ""any number or size"" of pro-union stickers to company-issued clothing.

""We may have concluded differently had Tesla prohibited union insignia,"" read the opinion issued Tuesday by a unanimous panel of three 5th Circuit judges.

The Associated Press sent emails requesting comment to Tesla and the UAW.

According to the court record, Tesla issued special black clothing with the company name and logo, dubbed ""Team Wear,"" to employees who worked on autos that had been recently painted. The clothing is issued to help prevent workers from inadvertently causing damage to paint that hasn't completely cured.

Some employees began wearing UAW shirts as an alternative in 2017, a practice the company cracked down on after several months, according to the opinion.

(AP Photo/Paul Sakuma, file)

The NLRB ruled in August 2022 that the practice was an ""overly broad"" uniform policy and ordered it stopped.

But the appeals panel said the company policy didn't keep the union from getting its message across to employees.

""The Team Wear policy - or any hypothetical company´s uniform policy - advances a legitimate interest of the employer and neither discriminates against union communication nor affects nonworking time,"" Judge Jerry Smith wrote for the panel.

The opinion comes as the 5th Circuit prepares for arguments in another union-related matter involving Tesla, NLRB and the assembly plant in Fremont, California.

A 5th Circuit panel ruled in March that Tesla CEO Elon Musk unlawfully threatened to take away employees´ stock options in a 2018 post on what was then Twitter amid an organizing effort by the UAW. The post was made before Musk bought the platform and renamed it X.

The panel upheld an NLRB order to delete the tweet. But that order was vacated after the full 5th Circuit, currently with 16 full-time judges, voted to hear the matter. A hearing in that case is pending.

The panel that issued this week's ruling included Smith, nominated to the appeals court by the late President Ronald Reagan; Leslie Southwick, nominated by former President George W. Bush; and Stephen Higginson, nominated by former President Barack Obama.","{'uri': 'dailymail.co.uk', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'Daily Mail Online'}",[],https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2023/11/16/22/wire-77905023-1700173281-929_636x382.jpg,eng-9064471,0.05098039215686279,25,25,Daily Mail Online,dailymail.co.uk

Law firm revenue grew by 4.6% during the first nine months of 2023, while net income grew by 2.7%, according to data from Wells Fargo's Legal Specialty Group. Its survey of more than 120 firms included 65 of the 100 highest-grossing U.S. firms.

The revenue increases were driven by ""some of the highest growth in billing rates we've seen,"" Wells Fargo said. Rates grew by 7.9% overall for the surveyed firms.

Expenses grew by 5.6% during the first nine months of 2023, Wells Fargo found, compared with 12.8% growth during the first nine months of 2022.

A nine-month survey from Citigroup's Citi Global Wealth at Work Law Firm Group had similar findings. Revenue for the nearly 200 law firms Citi surveyed grew by 4.8%, as did expenses.

The gains were not evenly shared, however. Only the 50 highest-grossing U.S. law firms as ranked by trade publication The American Lawyer saw a growth in net income--a measure of a firm's profitability--Wells Fargo reported.

The data provide a glimpse into the firms' balance sheets as associates wait to learn about year-end bonuses and whether they may receive a salary bump in line with increases announced last week by New York law firm Milbank.

First-year associates at Milbank will see their base pay jump from $215,000 to $225,000 under the firm's new seniority-based salary scale, according to an internal memo viewed by Reuters. The scale for eighth-year associates will top out at $425,000.

So far, no law firm has publicly said they will match or exceed Milbank's associate salary increases or year-end bonus, which ranges from a pro-rated $15,000 to $115,000, based on seniority. The country's biggest law firms typically adjust their salary scales within days or weeks of one another to remain competitive.

The apparent reluctance to raise salaries is not surprising, Wells Fargo consultants said. Along with associates, any increases would extend to counsel and non-equity partners as well, said Owen Burman, a senior consultant at Wells Fargo's Legal Specialty Group.

""It's an unplanned expense they were not expecting,"" Burman said. ""They were raising rates to support all of the other costs that are increasing across the industry.""

Highly profitable law firms will have the capacity to match Milbank's salary increases, but it might be difficult for others, Burman said. Net income rose by 5.2% for the top 50 firms, while shrinking slightly for law firms ranked 51 through 100, Wells Fargo found.

Law firms 101 through 200 in the American Lawyer's revenue rankings saw their net income shrink by 3.7% during the first nine months of 2023, according to Wells Fargo.

""The Second Hundred really does not show any capacity to absorb any kind of additional cost pressure,"" especially until they know they can collect outstanding client invoices, Burman said.

Milbank's 2023 bonuses match what the firm gave last year. While other firms may follow suit, some may attach billable hours requirements, said Stephanie Biderman of legal recruiting firm Major, Lindsey & Africa.

Some firms have always had an hours requirement, but there may be fewer associates who qualify for the bonuses because their billable hours are down, she said.

It also remains to be seen whether other top firms will match Milbank's new salary scale - or possibly exceed it.

""A lot of firms are in a holding pattern to see what peer firms are going to do,"" she said.","{'uri': 'reuters.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'Reuters'}","[{'uri': 'sara_merken@reuters.com', 'name': 'Sara Merken', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': False}, {'uri': 'david_thomas@reuters.com', 'name': 'David Thomas', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': False}]",https://www.reuters.com/resizer/FnONJeYVX43FmAW-ztGSBwuIZOE=/728x381/smart/filters:quality(80)/cloudfront-us-east-2.images.arcpublishing.com/reuters/AG4LBNBJYNPC5FSWLXIG5O2I4Q.jpg,,0.3176470588235294,25,25,Reuters,reuters.com

In a unanimous ruling signed by Justice Karen Valihura, the Delaware Supreme Court said it agreed with a lower court that Bayer was not on the hook for lawsuits over sales of the products before the deal, in which Bayer acquired Merck's consumer care business including Dr. Scholl's foot powder, closed.

The lawsuits claim that asbestos contained in talc-based products such as Dr. Scholl's caused cancer.

Bayer said in a statement that it was pleased with the decision. Merck did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Vice Chancellor Nathan Cook of the Delaware Chancery Court ruled in April that the 2014 purchase agreement ""clearly and unambiguously"" left Merck liable for claims related to products sold before the transaction closed.

New Jersey-based Merck had claimed that its liability ended on Oct. 1, 2021, seven years after the transaction closed, and sued Bayer after the German company refused to assume liability. However, Cook said the 2021 date referred to separate indemnification obligations, and not to the talc lawsuits.

Bayer is separately fighting to fend off lawsuits over the weedkiller Roundup, which it acquired as part of its $63 billion purchase of agrochemical giant Monsanto in 2018. The company has said that decades of studies have shown Roundup and its active ingredient, glyphosate, are safe for human use.

In 2020, it settled most of the then-pending Roundup cases for up to $10.9 billion, but still faces more than 40,000. It recently lost three trials with verdicts totaling more than $500 million, following nine consecutive wins.

The case is Merck & Co Inc v. Bayer AG, Supreme Court of the State of Delware, No. 150, 2023.

(AP) - The Virginia Attorney General has hired a law firm to represent James Madison University regarding the NCAA´s decision Wednesday night not to grant the Dukes a waiver from a rule that prevents the unbeaten No. 18 football team from an automatic bowl berth.

In a three-page letter, the law firm Hunton Andrews Kurth LLC argues for James Madison´s inclusion in bowl consideration based on its 10-0 record, No. 18 national ranking and unprecedented success in its two-year process reclassifying from the Football Championship Subdivision to the Bowl Subdivision, the game´s top tier.

""We fully hope and expect that the various Committees and the NCAA as a whole will do the right thing and allow JMU to compete in whatever bowl game its performance warrants,"" the letter says. Failing that, ""JMU is prepared to promptly file a lawsuit in the Western District of Virginia asserting that the bowl ban violates the antitrust and, potentially, other laws.""

In a statement, Attorney General Jason Miyares said the NCAA's denial of a waiver ""demonstrates yet again abject failures to act in the best interest of the nation's student-athletes. The NCAA has proven it is a broken institution which continues to make arbitrary and capricious decisions that are anti-competitive and have a profoundly negative impact on student-athletes, JMU, the Commonwealth of Virginia, collegiate football and athletes as a whole.""

Without a satisfactory resolution, Miyares said, ""I am prepared to expose the NCAA´s unlawful conduct and seek justice for James Madison University through litigation, provided the University authorize me to do so.""

In a statement Wednesday night from the Division I Board of Directors Administrative Committee, the committee said to two-year requirement is to allow programs moving up to ensure they have a sustainable plan beyond the playing field, such as infrastructure in place, adequate scholarship funding and medical and mental health resources.

""Division I members continually assess transition requirements, and the board continues to believe that if Division I members do not think the requirements are appropriate, those concerns should be addressed through rules changes rather than waiver requests,"" the statement said.

The committee also noted that James Madison and Jacksonville State, whose waiver request was also denied, might still have access to bowl games if there are not enough teams to meet the six-wins requirement to fill all slots.","{'uri': 'dailymail.co.uk', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'Daily Mail Online'}",[],,eng-9067184,-0.01960784313725494,25,25,Daily Mail Online,dailymail.co.uk

Right now, internet businesses that ship products nationwide can be sued on that basis in the 2nd, 7th and 9th Circuits, home to four of the five biggest cities in the U.S. But plaintiffs in the 5th and 8th Circuits, by contrast, can't establish jurisdiction solely by showing that an online retailer delivered a single product within the court's geographical boundaries.

That divide, according to several small companies that operate virtual storefronts on Amazon's website, is untenable in an era of explosive growth in online commerce. The companies' lawyers at Bochner have asked the U.S. Supreme Court to step in to resolve the circuit split and provide clear guidance on where internet retailers can be sued.

Specifically, Bochner's clients are seeking Supreme Court review of a ruling last summer by the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, which held that Arizona had jurisdiction over trademark infringement claims against the Amazon (AMZN.O) storefronts because the online retailers sold and delivered products to purchasers in Arizona.

Bochner's clients, led by a company called Photoplaza, framed the question presented in their petition as whether a seller whose products ship across the country ""is subject to personal jurisdiction in every forum into which even one of its products is shipped."" But to be fair, the 9th Circuit, as I told you when the ruling came down, did not specifically say that the delivery of a single product is sufficient to establish jurisdiction.

The appeals court instead instructed trial judges to focus on whether the sale and delivery of physical products within the plaintiff's chosen jurisdiction are a routine part of the online retailer's business. In the trademark case against the Amazon resellers, the appeals court said, the plaintiff -- health and wellness company Herbal Brands -- adequately alleged that the Amazon storefronts routinely shipped allegedly infringing products to Arizona customers.

It's even easier for plaintiffs in the 2nd and 7th Circuits to establish jurisdiction for lawsuits against internet retailers. The 2nd Circuit explicitly held in 2010's Chloe v. Queen Bee of Beverly Hills LLC that the single act of shipping an allegedly counterfeit handbag to New York was sufficient to give New York courts jurisdiction. The 7th Circuit's 2022 ruling on the jurisdictional issue, in NBA Properties, Incorporated v. HANWJH, also centered on the delivery of a single product, a pair of allegedly counterfeit NBA shorts.

Neither the 2nd Circuit nor the 7th Circuit was swayed by defense arguments that the plaintiffs themselves had manufactured jurisdiction by ordering the allegedly infringing products whose delivery established their right to sue.

On the other side of the circuit divide, the 8th Circuit held in 2022 that the delivery of a single T-shirt with an allegedly infringing logo was not enough to give Missouri courts jurisdiction over a trademark case. The 5th Circuit expressed the same view, albeit in dicta, in a 2021 decision describing the shipment of a lone product as ""the type of isolated act that does not create minimum contact.""

The Amazon resellers' certiorari petition argued that the 5th and 8th Circuits' analysis is faithful to Supreme Court precedent -- and that the reasoning of the 2nd, 7th and 9th Circuits is not.

The petition homed in on a pair of Supreme Court cases decided on the same day in 1984: Keeton v. Hustler Magazine, Inc., and Calder v. Jones.

Both cases involved jurisdictional challenges in libel suits against publications with nationwide circulations. In Keeton, the Supreme Court allowed a New York resident to sue Hustler magazine in New Hampshire (which has an unusually long statute of limitations for libel claims) because Hustler ""continuously and deliberately exploited the New Hampshire market"" by circulating the magazine in the state. In Calder, the justices ruled that actress Shirley Jones could sue the Florida-based National Enquirer in California because California, where Jones lived and worked, was the ""focal point"" of the alleged libel.

The two decisions, in tandem, offer ""clear rules"" on personal jurisdiction against non-resident defendants, the Amazon resellers said in their Supreme Court petition. When a defendant routinely ships thousands of products into a particular forum, that forum's courts have jurisdiction under Keeton. Otherwise, the petition said, courts must apply the Calder ""effects test"" to determine if the defendant's conduct was specifically aimed at the jurisdiction in which it has been sued.

The Amazon storefronts' petition asserted that isolated sales and deliveries are insufficient to establish jurisdiction under either Keeton or Calder precedent.

Herbal Brands counsel Daniel Wucherer of Vorys Sater, who argued for the company at the 9th Circuit, did not respond to my email query on the Supreme Court petition. But the 9th Circuit, in applying the Calder test, said Herbal Brands demonstrated that the Amazon storefronts had ""expressly aimed"" conduct at Arizona by routinely selling and delivering products in the state.

The Amazon resellers' petition is not the first to ask the Supreme Court to resolve the circuit split on where online retailers can be sued. The China-based online retailer in the 7th Circuit's NBA case filed a petition for certiorari last November. NBA Properties did not file a response. The Supreme Court declined to hear the case in January.

The Amazon storefronts argued in the new petition that the 9th Circuit's ruling widened and deepened the divide among the circuits on the issue of jurisdiction for claims against online retailers. They also emphasized the urgency of the issue as e-commerce becomes increasingly popular.

""Considering that Amazon and other e-commerce websites offer nationwide shipping, the 9th Circuit's rule extinguishes e-commerce sellers' due process rights and subjects them to jurisdiction in every state in the Union,"" said Serge Krimnus of Bochner, counsel of record for the storefronts, in an email statement. ""We hope the Supreme Court grants certiorari; applies the rule of the 5th and 8th Circuits; and reaffirms its decision in Calder v. Jones.""

Sunrise host Nat Barr has grilled a Labor politician over the government's rushed introduction of laws overnight to monitor 84 hardened criminals released into the community after a High Court ruling.

The nation's highest court ruled indefinite immigration detention is unlawful and detainees must be released, prompting Labor's emergency laws this week which include mandatory ankle bracelets and curfews.

Three of those released are murderers, one of whom killed a pregnant woman in Malaysia, and another was previously jailed for raping a 10-year-old boy in Sydney.

Education Minister Jason said on the program on Friday he had never seen laws passed so quickly in his 16 years in Parliament, but Barr told him hardworking Aussies were not impressed with the cost of monitoring these offenders.

'Jason $180,000 every month. That's the estimate on top of the welfare payments, the housing. Can you understand why taxpayers are not happy,' Barr asked the minister.

'Yeah, I get it. But this is not about money. This is about safety.

'If we had our way, these people would still be looked up. But that's not an option. The High Court has ordered that these people be released. We had to do that.

'And that's why we had to pass these laws to make sure that we keep Australians safe.'

This prompted Barr to question why the government did not have a 'contingency plan' in place beforehand.

'Jason why did you just pass them yesterday? You, by your own admission argued very strongly against them being released but then these laws were rushed through yesterday. Why not before?' Barr said.

'You are putting a positive spin on this. This made your government look bad, didn't it, because it made you guys look flat-footed because you didn't pass these laws before it happened.

'You must have known it was a possibility. These murders and rapists could have got out.

Sunrise host Nat Barr labelled the government 'flat-footed' after rushing through laws following the High Court's ruling on indefinite detention

Minister for Education Jason Clare (centre) said he had never seen laws passed so quickly in his 16 years in Parliament

Mr Clare fired back arguing the process of legislation had to happen after the High Court's ruling.

'You have to make sure the laws are written to respond to the laws are written to respond to the decision of the High Court,' he said.

'Otherwise they don't work.

'The Australian people are dirty with this decision. If we had our way, these people would still be locked up.

The legislation passed in a late-night sitting of parliament on Thursday with amendments agreed to by the government and the coalition.

The bill, which has been fast-tracked through parliament, will impose conditions on former detainees such as ankle-tracking devices and curfews.

Under the amendments, electronic monitoring and curfews would be made mandatory, rather than being at the discretion of the immigration minister, while those affected would be banned from taking part in organised activity that involves children.

Former detainees would also be barred from being within 150 metres of a school or daycare centre, while those who have been convicted of sexual assault or violence offences would be able to have a no-contact condition placed on their visa.

Each visa breach would be considered a separate offence, with mandatory minimum sentences imposed.

'The good news is when the cameras have been turned off the two major parties Labor and Liberal have worked well behind- the-scenes over the course of this week to get this legislation in place,' Mr Clare explained.

'What it shows is when the Parliament wants to work it can work. It's done that over the last 24-hours.'

Immigration Minister Andrew Giles introduced the changes following the High Court decision last week that found indefinite detention was unlawful.

The laws will apply to the more than 80 detainees released since the High Court decision.

The opposition had been pushing the government on the potential threat posed by criminals, including three murderers and a number of sex offenders, who were released into the community.

Mr Giles said the safety of the community remained the highest priority.

'From the moment the High Court handed down its decision we have been implementing measures to keep the community safe,' he told parliament.

Opposition immigration spokesman Dan Tehan said the laws were a good first step following the High Court decision.

'We've taken significant some significant steps to keep the community safe. We still think there is further steps that need to be taken, but that's a debate now for another day,' he said.

Acting Prime Minister Richard Marles said the government agreed with the amendments in principle.

'The basis on which we are doing this is because we are in a position where this must be resolved immediately,' he told parliament.

Greens senator Sarah Hanson-Young criticised the amendments as an 'absolute disgrace', in addition to being an attack on democracy and the rule of law.

'I know there are members of the Labor Party who are hanging their heads in shame,' she said.

'They know that ramming this piece of legislation through is wrong, is immoral.'

Liberal senator James Paterson criticised Mr Albanese for dodging responsibility by jetting off overseas 'while criminals remain free to roam the streets'.

Prime Minister Anthony Albanese in currently in the USA for the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) Summit

Government Senate leader Penny Wong urged the opposition to stop 'playing politics' and pass the legislation as soon as possible to keep Australians safe.

Greens immigration spokesman Nick McKim said the 'draconian laws' would provide the minister with powers never before seen in Australia, and the passing of the legislation was a 'dark day'.

'It is an utter disgrace, an abject craven capitulation by a party (Labor) that has forgotten where it has come from, and forgotten what it used to stand for,' he said.

The laws would create a two-tiered justice system for some migrants and refugees in comparison with Australians, he said.

New visa requirements for the released detainees will force them to notify the government on a change of address, or any association with clubs or organisations or individuals involved in illegal activity.","{'uri': 'dailymail.co.uk', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'Daily Mail Online'}",[],https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2023/11/16/21/77900819-0-image-m-15_1700169031105.jpg,eng-9062211,-0.2235294117647059,25,25,Daily Mail Online,dailymail.co.uk

Suella Braverman has demanded Rishi Sunak cuts the spin and gets real about Rwanda, or risk another year of delay and defeats.

She says MPs' Christmas holiday must also be cancelled so they can sit and debate the new emergency legislation before the end of the year.

The demand is part of her new five-point plan to get the Rwanda deal sorted once and for all.

In an op-ed this evening, the former Home Secretary set out five key tests Mr Sunak's new emergency legislation must achieve in order for Rwanda to succeed.

After writing an incendiary letter to Rishi Sunak following her sacking, the former Home Secretary said she welcomed the Prime Minister's decision to push through emergency legislation to send those who come to Britain illegally to Rwanda.

However, she warns the Government must finally end the ""self-deception and spin"" in order to achieve its aims.

""There must be no more magical thinking. Tinkering with a failed plan will not stop the boats"".

Ms Braverman writes in the Telegraph that the fundamental question at stake is ""where does ultimate authority in the United Kingdom sit?""

""Is it with the British people and their elected representatives in Parliament?

""Or is it with the vague, shifting, and unaccountable concept of 'international law'?""

While Ms Braverman says there is no point in wasting energy ""on a post-mortem of how we got here"", she warns that the Government lost in the Supreme Court because judges determined Rwanda cannot be trusted to not send asylum seekers back to their home country.

She argues that Mr Sunak's primary plan of signing a new treaty with Rwanda will therefore make little difference.

In addition, she argues the Government cannot waste another year trying to push the policy through the courts.

""Considering the constitutional and statutory rights at issue an interim stay is granted,"" wrote Associate Justice David Friedman, of New York state's intermediate appeals court.

He issued the stay in response to a request filed by Trump's legal team earlier this week that argued the gag order violated his First-Amendment -- as well as the state's -- freedom-of-speech rights.

The gag order on the former president was imposed by Judge Arthur Engoron after a derogatory post appeared on Trump's Truth Social platform. He has fined Trump twice since then for violations, most recently for $10,000 after he made a remark outside the courtroom that Engoron concluded was made in reference to the judge's principal law clerk, Allison Greenfield.

Friedman's order also grants temporary relief to Trump's attorneys, who have also been prohibited by Judge Engoron from discussing his communications with his staff.

In a written order, Engoron wrote that Trump's attorneys have made ""repeated, inappropriate remarks about my Principal Law Clerk, falsely accusing her of bias against them and of improperly influencing"" the trial.

""Defendants' attorneys have made long speeches alleging that it is improper for a judge to consult with a law clerk during ongoing proceedings, and that the passing of notes from a judge to a law clerk, or vice-versa, constitutes an improper 'appearance of impropriety' in this case,"" he wrote. ""These arguments have no basis.""

On Wednesday, attorneys for Trump requested a mistrial be declared in the case, claiming the judge and his clerk have subjected the defendants to ""tangible and overwhelming"" bias and unfair treatment.

The motion for a mistrial makes good on a promise Trump's attorneys made to file it the day he testified in the case on Nov. 6. The announcement capped off an intense day of examination in which Trump -- who has frequently criticized Engoron and Greenfield -- even lashed out at the judge on the witness stand, pointing at him and calling him a ""fraud.""

Engoron is overseeing the case brought by New York Attorney General Letitia James against Trump, his two oldest sons, the Trump Organization and several executives in New York State Supreme Court in Manhattan. James' office alleges the defendants orchestrated a decade-long fraud scheme to inflate the value of the company's properties and Trump's personal wealth. Engoron has already found the Trumps and their company liable for business fraud.

The trial, which is related to other allegations in the suit, is currently in its seventh week. All defendants have denied wrongdoing.","{'uri': 'cbsnews.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'CBS News'}",[],https://assets1.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2023/11/09/510b25f2-3506-4196-9f56-a7f3ffad7168/thumbnail/1200x630/7da5f2cd84468f3a8272b87b2d6f1454/ap23312650378080.jpg?v=31b2603d647356ee899167281d5e1b87,eng-9065743,-0.1450980392156863,25,25,CBS News,cbsnews.com

A New York appeals court judge on Thursday paused a gag order that barred Donald Trump from commenting on court staffers in his civil fraud trial. The trial judge had imposed the gag order last month and later fined Trump $15,000 for violations after the former president made a disparaging social media post about a court clerk.

In his decision, Judge David Friedman of the state's intermediate appeals court cited constitutional concerns about restricting Trump's free speech. He issued a stay of the gag order, allowing Trump to comment freely about court staff while a longer appeals process plays out.

Trump's lawyers filed a lawsuit against the trial judge, Arthur Engoron, late Wednesday challenging the gag order as an abuse of power. Friedman scheduled an emergency hearing Thursday afternoon around a conference table in a state appellate courthouse a couple of miles from where the trial is unfolding.

Trump's lawyers had asked the appeals judge to scrap the gag order and fines imposed by the trial judge, after the former president and his attorneys claimed that a law clerk was wielding improper influence.

Trump and his lawyers have repeatedly put the law clerk, Allison Greenfield, under a microscope during the trial. They contend that the former Democratic judicial candidate is a partisan voice in Judge Engoron's ear - though he also is a Democrat - and that she is playing too big a role in the case involving the former Republican president.

Engoron has responded by defending Greenfield's role in the courtroom, ordering participants in the trial not to comment on court staffers and fining Trump a total of $15,000 for what the judge deemed violations. Engoron went on last week to prohibit attorneys in the case from commenting on ""confidential communications"" between him and his staff.

Trump's lawyers - who, separately, sought a mistrial Wednesday - contend that Engoron's orders are unconstitutionally suppressing free speech, and not just any free speech.

""This constitutional protection is at its apogee where the speech in question is core political speech, made by the frontrunner for the 2024 Republican presidential nomination, regarding perceived partisanship and bias at a trial where he is subject to hundreds of millions of dollars in penalties and the threatened prohibition of his lawful business activities in the state,"" they wrote in a legal filing.","{'uri': 'theguardian.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'The Guardian'}",[],https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f4ce09d4cf13d515e27a89e88a46bc747fd0527d/0_356_7485_4493/master/7485.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&s=bbf841f82b9426c1fbcf2b435bdceffc,eng-9065743,-0.2627450980392156,25,25,The Guardian,theguardian.com

The United Nations' top court on Thursday ordered the Syrian government to ""take all measures within its powers"" to prevent torture, in a case in which the Netherlands and Canada accuse Damascus of a years-long campaign of torturing its citizens.

The interim order is intended to protect potential victims while the case accusing Syria of breaching the torture convention proceeds through the International Court of Justice, a process likely to take years.

The court's President Joan E. Donoghue said the panel was ordering Damascus to ""take all measures within its power to prevent acts of torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment.""

The court also called on Syria to ""ensure that its officials, as well as any organizations or persons, may be subject to its control, direction or influence do not commit any acts of torture or other acts of cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment.""

The court further ordered Damascus to ""take effective measures to prevent the destruction and ensure the preservation of any evidence related to the allegations of acts within the scope"" of the convention against torture, O'Donoghue said.

Canada and the Netherlands last month called on the court to order the torture ban. Syria boycotted the hearing in October and it remains unclear how it will respond to the world court's orders.

Syria's conflict started with peaceful protests against Assad's government in March 2011 but quickly morphed into a full-blown civil war after the government's brutal crackdown on protesters. The tide turned in Assad's favour against rebel groups in 2015, when Russia provided key military backing to Syria, as well as Iran and the Lebanese militant group Hezbollah.

At the hearings last month, Canadian government lawyer Teresa Crockett urged the court to impose a binding order on Syria, warning that: ""If left unchecked, Syria will continue its violations"" of an international convention banning torture.

Human Rights Watch welcomed the ruling.

""With systematic and widespread torture still a reality in Syria, the implementation of this ruling will be a matter of life or death for many Syrians in detention centres across Syria,"" Balkees Jarrah, the rights group's associate international justice director, said in a statement.

""After over a decade of torture by the Syrian authorities, the World Court's order could be key to breaking the cycle of abuse and impunity that the world has watched in horror as it unfolded,"" Jarrah added, calling on other governments around the world to ""ensure that the court's order is enforced to stop future abuses and bring accountability.""

Orders by the court are legally binding but are not always adhered to by countries involved in proceedings. Last year, the judges issued such an order in another case calling on Moscow to cease hostilities in Ukraine.

The orders by the UN court Thursday came a day after French judicial authorities issued international arrest warrants for Syrian President Bashar Assad, his brother and two army generals for alleged complicity in war crimes and crimes against humanity related to the use of chemical weapons in Syria in 2013.","{'uri': 'euronews.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'Euronews English'}",[],https://static.euronews.com/articles/stories/08/04/60/48/1000x563_cmsv2_d65a77ca-865e-5d5c-b5ca-ddcf7be6044f-8046048.jpg,eng-9067706,-0.5764705882352941,25,25,Euronews English,euronews.com

The court's order rejects a request from Florida officials to narrow the scope of an injunction issued by a federal district judge in June to apply only to a restaurant in Orlando known as Hamburger Mary's, which challenged the constitutionality of the new law. Justices Clarence Thomas, Samuel Alito and Neil Gorsuch said they would have granted Florida's bid to allow the law to take effect against other establishments in the state.

At issue in the case is the Protection of Children Act, which Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis signed into law in May. DeSantis is seeking the 2024 Republican presidential nomination and has billed himself as a champion of ""parental rights,"" an issue that has grown in prominence among the GOP presidential field.

The law prohibits any person from knowingly admitting a child to an ""adult live performance,"" which is defined as a show that ""depicts or simulates nudity, sexual conduct, sexual excitement or specific sexual activities"" and is ""patently offensive to prevailing standards in the adult community"" regarding what is suitable for age of the child in attendance.

Establishments that don't comply with the law are subject to fines and can lose their liquor licenses. Violators can also be charged with a misdemeanor.

Hamburger Mary's, which hosted ""family friendly"" drag show performances, sued the state over the law, arguing it violates the First Amendment. The restaurant asked a federal district court to block enforcement of the measure while it considers its constitutionality.

A trial court agreed to stop the state from enforcing the law, finding Hamburger Mary's is likely to succeed on its claims that the measure does not comport with the First Amendment.

U.S. District Judge Gregory Presnell, who is overseeing the case, said in a June order that the law's language is likely overbroad and risks sweeping up protected speech through its enforcement. He also found that the prohibition on drag shows clashes with another law, Florida's ""Parents' Bill of Rights,"" which states that parents have the right to ""direct the upbringing and the moral or religious training"" of their child.

""Existing obscenity laws provide [the state] with the necessary authority to protect children from any constitutionally unprotected obscene exhibitions or shows,"" Presnell wrote. ""The harm to [Hamburger Mary's] clearly outweighs any purported evils not covered by Florida law and a preliminary injunction would not be adverse to the public interest.""

Florida officials asked a federal appeals court to partially pause the lower court's order to allow enforcement against all entities but Hamburger Mary's. But a divided three-judge panel on the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals denied the request.

The state then turned to the Supreme Court for emergency relief, arguing in a filing that the district court's decision ""inflicts irreparable harm on Florida and its children by purporting to erase from Florida's statute books a law designed to prevent the exposure of children to sexually explicit live performances.""

""As long as the district court's preliminary injunction remains in place, Florida is powerless to enforce a law its elected representatives have enacted for the protection of its children,"" Attorney General Ashley Moody told the court in her request.

In its own filing with the Supreme Court, Hamburger Mary's said that after Florida's restriction took effect, it had to place age restrictions on its drag show performances, leading to cancellations of its bookings.

The restaurant warned that many of the artists who perform at the establishment work in other venues across the state and would be forced to censor their performances to avoid violating Florida's law when appearing elsewhere if the injunction applied only to Hamburger Mary's.

""HM's establishment would become the only business in the State of Florida where performers have the freedom of speech and expression guaranteed by the First Amendment,"" lawyers for Hamburger Mary's wrote.

The Supreme Court on Thursday rejected Florida's bid to enforce statewide a contentious law that targets drag show performances that, challengers say, imposes unlawful restrictions on free speech.

The court, divided 6-3 with three conservatives dissenting, turned away an emergency request from Florida officials after lower courts blocked the law statewide. The majority did not explain its reasoning.

The measure, widely seen as part of a conservative campaign against LGBTQ rights, was passed this year by the Florida legislature. Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, who is seeking the Republican presidential nomination and has frequently leaned into to culture war issues, signed the bill into law. DeSantis this year also signed into law a bill that restricts transgender health care.

Officially dubbed the Protection of Children Act, the law makes it a crime to admit a child to an ""adult live performance"" that the state deems sexually explicit.

The three justices who would have granted the state's request were Justice Clarence Thomas, Justice Samuel Alito and Justice Neil Gorsuch.

A district court judge blocked the law under the Constitution's First Amendment in part because it was too vaguely written, with key terms such as ""lewd conduct"" not defined. The Atlanta-based 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals left that ruling in place.

The legal challenge was brought by an Orlando bar and restaurant called Hamburger Mary's, which hosts what it calls family friendly drag shows.

The restaurant's lawyers say in court papers that the shows ""are not harmful to minors but likely still run afoul of the act due to its overbreadth and vagueness.""

The district court prevented the state from enforcing the law not just against Hamburger Mary's but also statewide. The state argued that the judge did not have authority to do so.

In its application to the Supreme Court, the state asked the justices to narrow the injunction so it only applied to the restaurant.

Justice Brett Kavanaugh, another conservative, wrote a brief opinion explaining why he voted against the state, saying the narrow issue the state was raising was not one the court would normally hear. Fellow conservative Justice Amy Coney Barrett joined most of Kavanaugh's opinion.

""This case is therefore an imperfect vehicle for considering the general question of whether a district court may enjoin a government from enforcing a law against non-parties to the litigation,"" he wrote.","{'uri': 'nbcnews.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'NBC News'}",[],"https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_nbcnews-fp-1024-512,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2023-11/231102-drag-queens-florida-sj-241p-838bdc.jpg",eng-9068811,-0.03529411764705881,25,25,NBC News,nbcnews.com

The suspect then struck the center median and intentionally hit the vehicles of people who were not involved in the incident.

An officer shot the suspect one time in the arm as they were trying to take the suspect into custody, according to Dwyer.

The suspect was taken to a local hospital with non-life-threatening injuries.

No one was injured, and there is no threat to the public.

The Prime Minister has announced that he will introduce emergency legislation to send those who come to our country illegally to Rwanda. I welcome his decision, as do I'm sure, the clear majority of the British public.

The immediate issue before us is whether the Government can send illegal migrants to a particular country in Africa.

The more fundamental question is where does ultimate authority in the United Kingdom sit? Is it with the British people and their elected representatives in Parliament? Or is it with the vague, shifting, and unaccountable concept of ""international law""?

There is no reason to criticise the judges. They have merely interpreted the law of the land. The fault lies with the politicians who have failed to introduce legislation that would guarantee delivery of our Rwanda partnership.

Now is not the time to waste energy on a post-mortem of how we got here. What matters for those of us who believe in effective immigration control is how to move forward. This requires honesty.

There must be an end to spin

Above all, it demands of the Government an end to self-deception and spin. There must be no more magical thinking. Tinkering with a failed plan will not stop the boats.

Amending our agreement with Rwanda and converting it into a treaty, even with explicit obligations on non-refoulement, will not solve the fundamental issue.

We lost in the Supreme Court because the judges determined that Rwanda cannot be trusted to fulfil the commitments we asked of them on non-refoulement, not because those promises were embodied in one type of legal instrument, a memorandum, rather than another, a treaty.

To try and deliver flights to Rwanda under any new treaty would still require going back through the courts, a process that would likely take at least another year.

That process could culminate in yet another defeat, on new grounds, or on similar grounds to Wednesday: principally, that judges can't be certain Rwanda will abide by the terms of any new treaty.

Even if we won in the domestic court, the saga would simply relocate to Strasbourg where the European court would take its time deciding if it liked our laws.

That is why the plan outlined by the PM will not yield flights to Rwanda before an election if Plan B is simply a tweaked version of the failed Plan A.

For emergency legislation to achieve what the PM says he wants, Parliament needs to amend the Illegal Migration Act so that it meets these five tests:

The Bill must address the Supreme Court's concerns regarding Rwanda

Parliament is entitled to assert that Rwanda is safe without making any changes to our Rwanda partnership.

However, for substantive and presentational reasons, it would be preferable to amend that agreement to address issues identified by the judges. This could include embedding UK observers and independent reviewers of asylum decisions.

It is less important whether these commitments are embodied in an amended memorandum or a new treaty.

What is crucial is that they are practical steps to improve Rwanda's asylum system. On the basis of these new commitments, Rwanda's safety could be credibly confirmed on the face of the Bill.The Bill must enable flights before the next general election

Legislation must therefore circumvent the lengthy process of further domestic litigation, to ensure that flights can take off as soon as the new Bill becomes law. To do this, the Bill must exclude all avenues of legal challenge. The entirety of the Human Rights Act and European Convention on Human Rights, and other relevant international obligations, or legislation, including the Refugee Convention, must be disapplied by way of clear ""notwithstanding"" clauses.

Judicial Review, all common law challenges, and all injunctive relief, including the suspensive challenges available under the Illegal Migration Act must be expressly excluded. Individuals would, however, be given the chance to demonstrate that they had entered the country legally, were under 18, or were medically unfit to fly - but Home Office decisions on these claims could not be challenged in court.Swift removal must mean swift removal

Those arriving illegally must be removed in a matter of days rather than months as under the Illegal Migration Act. This means amending the Act to ensure that removals to Rwanda are mandated under the duty to remove, with strict time limits. This will streamline the Home Office process as much as possible, so that the only Home Office decision is to determine whether an individual falls within the scheme or not.Those arriving here illegally must be detained

Legal challenges to detention must be excluded to avoid burdening the courts, making it clear that detention is mandated until removal.This must be treated as an emergency

Kyle Gould pleaded guilty to charges of criminally negligent homicide and reckless endangerment in the killing of Christian Glass in Clear Creek County Court on Thursday afternoon. The plea was expected and a sentencing hearing began immediately following it in which Gould was given a $100,000 fine and two years of probation.

Glass, 22, was shot and killed in Colorado's high country after he called 911 for help when his car broke down. It happened on June 10 in Silver Plume and officers from several different law enforcement agencies responded. Glass told the emergency dispatcher he had two knives, a hammer and a rubber mallot. His family's attorney say that is because he was an amateur geologist. Over the span of an hour, officers told him he needed to get out of his car and dismissed attempts to drop the weapons out of his window. Glass refused to leave the car, saying he was scared. As things escalated, officers broke a window in an attempt to get him out and Glass grabbed one of the knives. Officers then tased him. Body cam video then showed Glass beginning to swing the knife wildly with his arm. That's when an officer or officers shot him.

As part of Gould's plea deal, he also agrees that he can't serve as a police officer or security officer ever again in the state of Colorado.

While Gould's case has wrapped up, another employee of the Clear Creek County Sheriff's Office, former deputy Andrew Buen, is fighting his charges of second-degree murder, official misconduct and reckless endangerment.

Glass's parents, Simon and Sally Glass, were present at the courthouse and were set to speak at the sentencing hearing for Gould.","{'uri': 'cbsnews.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'CBS News'}",[],https://assets2.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2022/11/28/9aa8dad7-e8b7-4c14-b0b9-777847f6de8a/thumbnail/1200x630/543b44f65461689fe4d5e209eed891e2/img-1250-scaled-1024x1024-jpg-frame-409.jpg?v=31b2603d647356ee899167281d5e1b87,eng-9069006,-0.3568627450980392,25,25,CBS News,cbsnews.com

The trial judge had imposed the gag order last month and later fined Trump 15,000 dollars (£12,000) for violations after the former president made a disparaging social media post about a court clerk.

Judge David Friedman, of the state's intermediate appeals court, cited constitutional concerns about restricting Trump's free speech.

He issued a stay of the gag order, allowing Trump to comment freely about court staff while a longer appeals process plays out.

Trump's lawyers filed a lawsuit against the trial judge, Arthur Engoron, late on Wednesday, challenging the gag order as an abuse of power.

Judge Friedman scheduled an emergency hearing on Thursday around a conference table in a state appellate court a couple of miles from where the trial is unfolding.

Trump's lawyers had asked the appeals judge to scrap the gag order and fines imposed by the trial judge, Arthur Engoron, after the former president and his attorneys claimed that a law clerk was wielding improper influence.

Trump and his lawyers have repeatedly put the law clerk, Allison Greenfield, under a microscope during the trial.

They contend that the former Democratic judicial candidate is a partisan voice in Judge Arthur Engoron's ear - though he also is a Democrat - and that she is playing too big a role in the case involving the former Republican president.

Judge Engoron has defended her role in the courtroom, ordering participants in the trial not to comment on court staff and fining Trump for what the judge deemed violations.

Judge Engoron went on last week to prohibit lawyers in the case from commenting on ""confidential communications"" between him and his staff.

Trump's lawyers who, separately, sought a mistrial on Wednesday, say Judge Engoron's orders are unconstitutionally suppressing free speech, and not just any free speech.

""This constitutional protection is at its apogee where the speech in question is core political speech, made by the frontrunner for the 2024 Republican presidential nomination, regarding perceived partisanship and bias at a trial where he is subject to hundreds of millions of dollars in penalties and the threatened prohibition of his lawful business activities in the state,"" they wrote in a legal filing.","{'uri': 'dailymail.co.uk', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'Daily Mail Online'}",[],https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2023/11/16/20/wire-77899619-1700167151-530_636x382.jpg,eng-9065743,-0.2705882352941177,25,25,Daily Mail Online,dailymail.co.uk

Sky News understands the New Conservatives group - a cohort of predominantly red wall MPs on the right of the party - will demand the legislation be ""over-engineered"" so it can see off potential further legal challenges.

The Supreme Court ruled on Wednesday that the flagship immigration policy to deport refugees to Rwanda was unlawful.

Politics live: James Cleverly briefly forgets where he works and makes sly digs

The prime minister has rejected calls to scrap the plan, saying a new treaty with Rwanda would be signed and ""emergency legislation"" would be passed in order to declare the east African country safe and address the judges' concerns.

However, some Tory MPs are sceptical about the timings and fear the new bill could still be challenged.

The New Conservative group will make three requests to stop this from happening, including that the new legislation disapplies the UK Human Rights Act.

They will say it should also include ""notwithstanding"" clauses in order to override any international treaties or laws that could block the plan.

And they also want to give ministers powers to disregard so-called ""pyjama injunctions"" - which are last-minute orders from judges that could stop planes from taking off.

The group of MPs wants the legislation to be drawn up immediately, so it can be in place before the next general election.

The letter piles fresh pressure on Mr Sunak, who has staked his premiership on a promise to ""stop the boats"".

But with an election due by the end of next year, time is running out to pass new legislation, which can take months.

Earlier, Chancellor Jeremy Hunt said he could not guarantee flights will go to Rwanda next year - apparently contradicting Mr Sunak's position on Wednesday that the scheme will be up and running by spring, despite the Supreme Court ruling.

The UK's highest court said the scheme was not lawful because there was a risk that people sent to Rwanda could be deported to the countries they are fleeing from (a term known as refoulement).

The judges said this fell foul not only of the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR), which many Tory MPs want to leave, but also other international treaties and the UK's own domestic legislation.

Explainer - how did the government policy end up in the courts?

The yet-to-be-published treaty with Rwanda is expected to attempt to address the Supreme Court's concerns around refoulement.

However, it is not clear how the government thinks it can bypass human rights laws and international conventions, or when the new legislation will be brought before parliament.

Members of the House of Lords have warned the proposed emergency legislation bill is likely to face opposition and could very well be blocked by the upper chamber.

It was then reported earlier today that a shooting took place outside of the El Paso Courthouse.

Someone was found dead on the floor with an apparent gunshot wound following the shooting, Colorado Springs Police spokesperson Ira Cronin confirmed. There are also unconfirmed reports of injuries at the scene. One suspect is currently in custody in relation to the shooting, CSPD said.

Colorado Springs Police Department announced on X saying: 'CSPD is responding to a shooting at the El Paso County Courthouse. PIO en route. Media staging will be at the corner of Tejon and Vermijo. Media should approach from the south' at 12:24 pm. They then posted an update at 12:36 pm saying: 'This is not an active shooter situation. There is no threat to the community. The courthouse will be closed for the remainder of the day. CSPD will provide more updates as appropriate.' In an update - CSPD posted: 'Once on scene, officers located one deceased individual with apparent gunshot wounds.

'This is being investigated as a homicide, however, the El Paso County Coroner's Office will determine the official cause and manner of death. 'At this time, this appears to be an isolated incident and not an active shooter incident. There is no threat to the community. There is one suspect currently in custody.' Many police and first responder vehicles were at the scene in Colorado after the shooting was reported earlier today. CSPD put up caution tape as well as screens to block the public's view.

Tejon Street between Colorado and Vermijo remains closed for police investigation. Video from outside the courthouse shows police officers as they escort an unidentified woman - who appeared to be distraught away from the scene as she sobbed in distress. Witnesses say the shooting was a domestic violence incident and confirmed that at least one person was shot. They say the courthouse was evacuated and a crime scene was set up. A female witness said she heard the shooting was a domestic disturbance between a husband and wife, according to CBS.

The Colorado Springs Fire Department said two people were treated on the scene for minor injuries. Whether those injuries came from gunshots or not is unclear at this time. A gentleman in court at the time of the alleged shooting said they were all sent to the third floor where they waited for 15 minutes, he told KOAA News 5. The man said it was scary - but he's glad his family is safe. This story is still developing as investigations continue.

A three-judge panel of the New York-based 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals heard arguments in Amazon's bid to toss out the ruling won last year by the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB), which stemmed from a union campaign at a Staten Island warehouse.

The NLRB had accused Amazon of firing a leading union organizer, Gerald Bryson, after a 2020 protest over an alleged lack of safety measures at the warehouse during the COVID-19 pandemic. The warehouse last year became the first in Amazon's history to unionize.

Amazon workers at two other New York warehouses and one in Alabama have since voted against unionizing. A union is currently seeking an election at a warehouse in California.

In Bryson's case, the NLRB had sought an injunction in court against Amazon pending the outcome of a related case playing out at the board.

U.S. District Judge Diane Gujarati in Brooklyn ordered Amazon to cease and desist from firing workers for engaging in union activity, while declining to require the company to reinstate Bryson.

On Thursday, 2nd Circuit Judges Richard Wesley and Denny Chin both expressed concerns that the order was not specific enough and merely required Amazon to comply with its existing obligations under federal labor law.

Wesley told NLRB lawyer Chad Wallace that the injunction seemed too sweeping given that Bryson was the only worker who was allegedly fired unlawfully.

""The problem I have is when you repeat this kind of generalized warning but it's in the context of a single incident,"" Wesley said.

Wallace said the order was sufficiently tailored because it dealt with a specific provision of the law - the ban on retaliating against workers for engaging in union activity.

""Terminating employees who actively and openly advocate for themselves is a hallmark violation"" of the National Labor Relations Act, Wallace said.

Circuit Judge Debra Ann Livingston seemed less sympathetic to Amazon, noting that Gujarati in a brief portion of her ruling stated that she had considered the ""equitable principles"" involved in issuing an injunction.

Amazon's lawyer, Stephanie Schuster, said the judge's order was not only overly broad, but was so vague that Amazon could not meaningfully comply with it and was at risk of being held in contempt of court.

""Amazon cannot tell from the four corners of the injunction precisely what conduct is prohibited,"" she said.

Amazon claims that it fired Bryson for making vulgar comments to a female employee during the April 2020 protest. A video of the protest showed Bryson calling the woman a ""crackhead"" and ""stupid,"" among other comments.

Some Republican lawmakers criticized the NLRB for pursuing the case, citing Bryson's conduct at the protest.

An NLRB administrative judge last year ordered Amazon to reinstate Bryson and the company appealed.

The five-member board in August remanded the case to the judge to apply a new legal standard the board had adopted for cases where employees engage in misconduct while exercising their rights to organize. The case is pending.

The case is Poor v. Amazon.com Services LLC, 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, No. 22-3182.

George Osborne has said that leaving the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) is ""off the table"" while Lord Cameron is Foreign Secretary.

Mr Osborne, who served as the former prime minister's chancellor, suggested that withdrawing from the international treaty would be too ""extreme"" for Lord Cameron, despite frustrations in Government after the Supreme Court ruled its Rwanda scheme unlawful.

It comes as Rishi Sunak was warned that his proposed new law to overcome the ruling would be blocked by the Lords, with a former Supreme Court judge describing it as ""constitutionally extraordinary"" and ""profoundly discreditable"".

Lord Cameron was brought back into Government by the Prime Minister earlier this week and made a life peer, following a seven-year break from front-line politics.

While prime minister, Lord Cameron appeared open to leaving the ECHR amid a row over whether a blanket ban on prisoners taking part in elections was in breach of their human rights.

However, Mr Osborne told his Political Currency podcast with Ed Balls: ""The interesting thing about David Cameron's appointment... I don't think necessarily he will go along with something as extreme as that. He's actually more Right-wing than I am on this. He was a Home Office special adviser for Michael Howard.

""He's always railed against elements of ECHR judgments. But I think the option of going into the general election saying we're going to pull out of the ECHR and throw the challenge to Labour, see whether they agree or not, I think that's basically now off the table because David Cameron is Foreign Secretary.""

When Lord Cameron was asked in 2015 whether the UK might pull out of the ECHR should it face obstacles in its attempt to change Labour-era human rights laws, he said he would ""rule out absolutely nothing in getting that done"".

""We are very clear about what we want, which is British judges making decisions in British courts,"" he added.

Following the Supreme Court's ruling on Wednesday, Mr Sunak insisted he would ""not allow a foreign court to block these flights"", but was not specific about what measures he would be willing to take.

Suella Braverman, the former home secretary, is among those on the Right wing of the Tory Party demanding that Mr Sunak introduces laws to specifically block off the ECHR, Human Rights Act and other routes of legal challenge to the Government's plan to deport asylum seekers to Rwanda.

The Government is expected to publish a new treaty with Rwanda next week, followed by emergency legislation a week later, to block legal challenges to the policy by declaring the country safe.

Ministers hope to fast-track the legislation and treaty through Parliament so that the first Rwanda flights can take off in spring.

However, James Cleverly, the Home Secretary, only committed on Thursday to saying he was ""absolutely determined"" to get them off by the next election.

The timetable will depend on securing Parliamentary approval for the emergency law underpinning the treaty, in which Rwanda has made legally binding commitments not to remove anyone deported from the UK.

This is designed to prevent any deported migrants from being sent to their home country where they could face persecution. This is the central reason why the Supreme Court ruled that the policy was unlawful and why it was judged unsafe as a destination for asylum seekers.

'Profoundly discreditable'

However, Lord Sumption, a Supreme Court judge from 2012 to 2018, said it was ""profoundly discreditable"" and ""constitutionally extraordinary"" for the Government to ""change the facts by law"" by proposing legislation that would declare Rwanda safe. He warned it would be unlikely to pass the House of Lords.

""It is not unusual for governments to promote legislation to change the law after an unfavourable judgment in the courts, but I have never heard of them trying to change the facts by law. For as long as black isn't white, the business of passing Acts of Parliament to say it is, is profoundly discreditable,"" he said.

""I would have thought there would be an enormous brouhaha. The Government has the advantage of quite a lot of public opinion supporting it, but that only carries you so far.

""It would be constitutionally a completely extraordinary thing to do, to effectively overrule a decision on the facts, on the evidence, by the highest court in the land.""

'Constitutional outrage'

Lord Carlile, a former independent reviewer of terrorism legislation for the Government, said legislating to declare Rwanda safe when the courts had found it not to be was a ""constitutional outrage"" and would face ""constructive obstruction"" in the Lords.

""It will get completely bogged down. It will go into eternal ping-pong. It is a no-hoper in the House of Lords, and deliberately sets up conflict between the two Houses,"" he said.

The Government would not be able to use the Parliament Act - a law that allows the Commons to overrule the Lords if a piece of legislation is voted down by peers - because it is the last Parliamentary session before the next election.

Lord Paddick, a former deputy assistant commissioner at the Metropolitan Police, said: ""Given the authority that retired judges have over the whole house, it would be unlikely for the House of Lords to effectively overrule the findings of fact of the Supreme Court.""

Sir Robert Buckland, a former Justice Secretary, said the Bill would ""struggle"" in the Lords because of the perception by peers that the legislation is ""inappropriate"" and even ""dangerous"".

'Absolutely priority'

Asked about the prospect of opposition in the Lords, Mr Cleverly said that peers should recognise that the Rwanda flights are ""an absolute priority"" of the British people.

""Their lordships are thoughtful people. I am sure they recognise that the British people particularly from poorer communities are the ones under most pressure from illegal migration,"" he said.

He noted that the courts had accepted that using a third country to handle asylum decisions was legal, and even the Supreme Court acknowledged that ""changes and capacity-building needed to eliminate that risk [of refoulement] may be delivered in the future"".

""We listened very carefully to the Appeal Court judgment and we've been working with the Rwandans since then,"" he told Times Radio.

""We've got a memorandum of understanding which we're going to upgrade to a treaty that can be done very, very quickly because we have been working on it for some time and the Prime Minister has committed to making sure that we get this emergency legislation into the House quickly.""","{'uri': 'telegraph.co.uk', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'The Telegraph'}","[{'uri': 'charles_hymas@telegraph.co.uk', 'name': 'Charles Hymas', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': False}]",https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/politics/2023/11/16/TELEMMGLPICT000346855032_17001629413090_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqgsaO8O78rhmZrDxTlQBjdLdu0TL-Cg_AMOUqySXmFgU.jpeg?impolicy=logo-overlay,eng-9063836,0.08235294117647052,25,25,The Telegraph,telegraph.co.uk

The judge in the Georgia election interference case has granted a request from Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis' office for an emergency protective order after parts of videos from key witnesses against former President Donald Trump and his allies were leaked to news outlets.Judge Scott McAfee on Thursday issued a protective order that prohibits attorneys in the case from sharing sensitive materials with the public. The order requires prosecutors to physically label evidence it seeks to protect as ""sensitive material"" and gives defense attorneys 14 days to contest any designations they disagree with. Willis' team now has 30 days to review all discovery they've already provided and label as sensitive.

McAfee said that the order would promote the flow of pre-trial discovery and, more importantly, protect the jury pool from evidence that may be deemed inadmissible at trial.

""The Court has an interest in ensuring that all parties retain their right to a fair trial before an unbiased jury, a process that could become unattainable should the public be allowed to vet every piece of unfiltered evidence months before trial,"" McAfee wrote in the filing.

Willis' office asked for the protective order in a court filing Tuesday after parts of the videotaped statements of Jenna Ellis, Sidney Powell and Kenneth Chesebro and bail bondsman Scott Hall were made public. In its filing, Willis' office argued that an order was necessary ""to protect witnesses and to safeguard sensitive and confidential information"" during the discovery process. It said the leaks were ""clearly intended to intimidate witnesses in this case, subjecting them to harassment and threats prior to trial.""

The DA in August charged 19 defendants with violating Georgia's Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organization act in connection with efforts to overturn the 2020 election results in the battleground state. Chesebro, Ellis, Hall and Powell have pleaded guilty. The videotaped statements, known as proffer videos, were made pursuant to the four defendants' plea agreements, which required them to give true and accurate information to prosecutors.

The Ellis and Powell statements were first reported by ABC News, while the Chesebro and Hall statements were first reported by The Washington Post. The recordings, which have not been independently obtained by NBC News, revealed new details of the defendants' testimony to prosecutors.

The videos showed Ellis recalling a conversation with Trump adviser Dan Scavino, who told her that Trump would not depart the White House regardless of the election results, she said. Powell had testified that Trump was repeatedly told by others that he'd lost the election to President Joe Biden.

A lawyer for Trump co-defendant Misty Hampton admitted at a hearing Wednesday that he had shared witness proffer videos of key figures in the case with a media outlet, saying he thought it was in his client's best interest.

Jonathan Miller, an attorney for Hampton, made the admission during an emergency hearing Wednesday for the protective order. Hampton is charged with a scheme to access voting machines in Coffee County, which Powell and Hall were also charged with.

""In being transparent with the court and to make sure that nobody else gets blamed for what happened and so that I can go to sleep well tonight, judge, I did release those videos to one outlet,"" Miller told McAfee during the hearing. ""In all candor to the court, I need the court to know that.""

McAfee had signaled Wednesday that he would issue a protective order barring the disclosure of certain discovery information by Thursday morning. He said the order would institute a process by which parties can label certain evidence as sensitive.

""Until we decide what's going to be relevant and admissible, this case should be tried and not in the court of public opinion,"" McAfee said during Wednesday's hearing.

Tom Clyde, an attorney for a coalition of media organizations that did not include NBC News, objected to the protective order, citing First Amendment interests, during the hearing Wednesday.

""Essentially what the state and the defendants are trying to do is get the authority of the court behind an order that will impose secrecy on information that is exchanged during the discovery process. Notwithstanding how newsworthy that information is, notwithstanding how much it might inform the public about the circumstances of this case, but particularly in this case, the circumstances of an election that took place, that's extremely significant in public importance,"" Clyde said.

McAfee said he disagreed with Clyde's arguments, but acknowledged the First Amendment concerns. The judge said a protective order was needed to protect the jury pool and to keep the flow of discovery going.

""Until we decide what's going to be relevant and admissible, this case should be tried and not in the court of public opinion,"" he said during the hearing Wednesday. ""We've already seen what may happen when a protective order is not in place.""

The next hearing in this case is scheduled for Dec. 1, when several motions from defendants will be argued.","{'uri': 'nbcnews.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'NBC News'}",[],"https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_nbcnews-fp-1024-512,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2023-11/231116-kenneth-chesebro-mn-1245-45a08e.jpg",eng-9061266,0.2862745098039217,25,25,NBC News,nbcnews.com

The trial judge had imposed the gag order last month and later fined Trump $15,000 for violations after the former president made a disparaging social media post about a court clerk.

In his decision, Judge David Friedman of the state´s intermediate appeals court cited constitutional concerns about restricting Trump´s free speech. He issued a stay of the gag order, allowing Trump to comment freely about court staff while a longer appeals process plays out.

Trump´s lawyers filed a lawsuit against the trial judge, Arthur Engoron, late Wednesday challenging the gag order as an abuse of power. Friedman scheduled an emergency hearing Thursday afternoon around a conference table in a state appellate courthouse a couple of miles from where the trial is unfolding.

Trump's lawyers had asked the appeals judge to scrap the gag order and fines imposed by the trial judge, Arthur Engoron, after the former president and his attorneys claimed that a law clerk was wielding improper influence.

Trump and his lawyers have repeatedly put the law clerk, Allison Greenfield, under a microscope during the trial. They contend that the former Democratic judicial candidate is a partisan voice in Judge Arthur Engoron's ear - though he also is a Democrat - and that she is playing too big a role in the case involving the former Republican president.

Engoron has responded by defending her role in the courtroom, ordering participants in the trial not to comment on court staffers and fining Trump a total of $15,000 for what the judge deemed violations. Engoron went on last week to prohibit attorneys in the case from commenting on ""confidential communications"" between him and his staff.

Trump's lawyers - who, separately, sought a mistrial Wednesday - contend that Engoron's orders are unconstitutionally suppressing free speech, and not just any free speech.

""This constitutional protection is at its apogee where the speech in question is core political speech, made by the frontrunner for the 2024 Republican presidential nomination, regarding perceived partisanship and bias at a trial where he is subject to hundreds of millions of dollars in penalties and the threatened prohibition of his lawful business activities in the state,"" they wrote in a legal filing.","{'uri': 'dailymail.co.uk', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'Daily Mail Online'}",[],https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2023/11/16/20/wire-77898885-1700165871-933_636x382.jpg,eng-9065743,-0.2627450980392156,25,25,Daily Mail Online,dailymail.co.uk

An initial complaint from the Louisiana State Police, dated Oct. 17 and obtained through a public records request this week, said the department's insurance fraud/auto theft unit in New Orleans is investigating McClenny Moseley & Associates, now known as MMA, for fraud, forgery, improper solicitation of clients and other potential charges. A Louisiana State Police spokesperson did not respond to questions about the investigation.

The investigation, which was first reported by local Louisiana media, originated with the Louisiana Department of Insurance, which found more than 20 insurance claim lawsuits were filed on behalf of people who said they had never hired MMA to represent them. Many of those people had never received the settlement funds from their cases, according to the complaint.

Representatives for MMA and the attorneys involved in the Louisiana cases, John Zachary Moseley and William Huye, did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Former name partner James McClenny directed questions to his attorney, who did not respond.

McClenny Moseley, which is based in Houston, filed hundreds of lawsuits in Louisiana state and federal courts last year against insurers on behalf of homeowners who suffered property damage from hurricanes Laura, Delta and Ida. In January, the firm attracted the scrutiny of judges over allegations that the attorneys improperly solicited or paid for clients through a marketing company and a roofer, brought claims against the wrong insurers, filed duplicate lawsuits or sued insurers that had already settled with their clients.

Attorneys from the firm have faced disciplinary proceedings in both state and federal court, court records show. A Louisiana federal judge has blocked the firm and its attorneys from collecting any fees in about 200 cases.

The law firm and its attorneys are also facing multiple malpractice lawsuits in state and federal court from former clients who say they lost out on their chance to pursue their insurer for compensation due to McClenny Moseley's mishandling of their case.

In May, the Louisiana Department of Insurance hit the firm with $2 million in fines, accusing the lawyers of engaging in fraud and unfair trade practices with about 850 homeowners.

The department, which was originally tipped off by insurance defense attorney Matthew Monson, took its findings to the Louisiana State Police in October, according to the complaint. A department representative did not respond to a request for comment about the investigation.

Monson told Reuters that ""there is a healthy basis"" for the investigation.","{'uri': 'reuters.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'Reuters'}","[{'uri': 'diana_novak_jones@reuters.com', 'name': 'Diana Novak Jones', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': False}]",https://www.reuters.com/resizer/j7lxWgrAPPiTQDFlQriQYxswjDc=/728x381/smart/filters:quality(80)/cloudfront-us-east-2.images.arcpublishing.com/reuters/UKAJJ6R7BFOIBJAC3MUHLGZILI.jpg,,-0.3254901960784313,25,25,Reuters,reuters.com

The judge overseeing former President Donald Trump's election interference case in Georgia has issued a protective order that certain ""sensitive"" evidence in the case be withheld from the public.

The order, issued Wednesday by Superior Court Judge Scott McAfee, came after the video recordings of interviews with some of Trump's co-defendants were leaked to the media earlier this week.

It specifies that prosecutors can deem certain evidence turned over to the defense as ""sensitive material"" unfit for public release, and provides that the defense can challenge such a designation within 14 days.

District Attorney Fani Willis had requested a broader version of the order following the leaking of the video interviews, citing potential harassment, witness intimidation, or jury pool tainting.

Defense attorney Jonathan Miller, who represents former Coffee County election supervisor Misty Hampton, admitted to leaking the video evidence, which included excerpts from prosecutor interviews with former Trump attorneys Jenna Ellis and Sidney Powell, as well as pro-Trump lawyer Kenneth Chesebro and Atlanta bail bondsman Scott Hall.

All four have pleaded guilty to charges in the case and agreed to cooperate with prosecutors as they pursue charges against the remaining 15 defendants.

The Maldives filed a separate declaration.

Under the court's rules, the declarations mean those countries will be able to make legal arguments in the case brought in 2019 following international outrage at the treatment of the Rohingya, a Muslim minority. Hundreds of thousands fled to neighboring Bangladesh amid a brutal crackdown by Myanmar forces.

Gambia argued that it and Myanmar are both parties to the 1948 convention outlawing genocide and that all signatories have a duty to ensure it is enforced. It asked the court to declare Myanmar in breach of the convention.

The court has already ruled it has jurisdiction, though hearings in the case have not been scheduled.

Myanmar's military launched what it called a clearance campaign in Rakhine state in 2017 in the aftermath of an attack by a Rohingya insurgent group. More than 700,000 Rohingya fled into neighboring Bangladesh. Myanmar security forces have been accused of mass rapes, killings and torching thousands of Rohingya homes.

Myanmar tried unsuccessfully to have the case thrown out, arguing the world court can only hear disputes between nations and Gambia was acting on behalf of the Organization of Islamic Cooperation.

The judges also dismissed Myanmar's claim that Gambia could not file the case as it was not directly linked to the events in Myanmar and that a legal dispute did not exist between the two countries before the case was filed.

The International Court of Justice rules on disputes between states. It is not linked to the International Criminal Court, also based in The Hague, which holds individuals accountable for atrocities.

An attorney for Phhhoto told the New York-based 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals that a lower trial court judge wrongly found the app's competition lawsuit against Meta was not filed in time.

Phhhoto accused Meta of manipulating an algorithm to suppress the app's animated photographs on the social media company's Instagram platform. U.S. District Judge Kiyo Matsumoto in Brooklyn dismissed the 2021 lawsuit in March because the allegations stemmed from 2016, outside the four-year window for antitrust plaintiffs to sue.

The case, which is one of several private and government lawsuits accusing Meta of anticompetitive practices, tests the legal principle of whether and when the statute of limitations can be extended.

Phhhoto launched in 2014 and said it had reached 10 million registered users two years later. It shut down in 2017.

Thursday's appeals court panel -- Chief Circuit Judge Debra Ann Livingston, sitting with Circuit Judges Denny Chin and Richard Wesley -- at points sounded skeptical of Phhhoto's contention that it could not have sued sooner.

""Don't you need to find something that occurred within the four years prior to the suit?"" Chin said at the hearing. Livingston pressed Phhhoto on ""warnings"" that might have given it ""some reason to worry that Meta was suppressing its content.""

Phhhoto's attorney, Scott Martin of the plaintiffs' firm Hausfeld, argued that Meta fraudulently ""concealed"" the change to its algorithm, making Phhhoto unable to immediately discern what was happening to the app and why.

""There was no evidence at all to lead them to believe that the algorithm was suppressing photo related content,"" Martin told the panel.

An attorney for Meta, Aaron Panner of Kellogg, Hansen, Todd, Figel & Frederick, countered that Phhhoto was ""on notice"" in 2016 about the impact of the algorithm change on the app's content.

""They can't explain why they waited five years to sue,"" Panner said.

Panner and Martin did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Meta has denied that it concealed anything from Phhhoto and urged the appeals court to uphold the dismissal of the lawsuit.

The case is Phhhoto Inc v. Meta Platforms Inc, 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, No. 23-0763.

For Phhhoto: Scott Martin of Hausfeld

For Meta: Aaron Panner of Kellogg, Hansen, Todd, Figel & Frederick

Kenya's high court on Thursday extended orders blocking the deployment of police officers to Haiti, even as parliament approved a government request to send 1,000 officers to the Caribbean nation to help deal with gang violence.

High Court Judge Chacha Mwita said he would issue a ruling on Jan. 26, effectively delaying the sending of security officers to Haiti, where they are slated to lead a multinational force backed by the U.N Security Council.

The planned deployment was first blocked by the High Court in Nairobi in October.

HAITIAN HOSPITAL SURROUNDED BY GANG MEMBERS; WOMEN, CHILDREN HELD HOSTAGE

Whatever decision is reached by the High Court in January may be appealed, meaning there could be a protracted battle over sending the troops to Haiti.

The court decision came hours after Kenya's parliament passed a motion allowing the deployment of the security officers.

But the government was immediately criticized for disobeying the court orders first issued in October that barred the deployment.

""The tabling of the motion in parliament today was belligerent. A disregard to the rule of law that clearly states that one arm of government cannot discuss a matter already seized by another arm,"" said former presidential candidate Ekuru Aukot, who filed the court case.

Herman Manyora, a professor of journalism at the University of Nairobi, said the government had no choice but to respect the court's decision on the delay.

""President William Ruto's government has a history of ignoring court decisions, but if it's a law-abiding government, it will wait until the court makes the final decision. Even the debate in parliament is a brazen defiance of the laws of the country.""

Earlier, the Kenyan parliament approved a government motion from the Committee on Administration and Internal Security approving the government's request to send the security officers as violence escalates in Haiti.

The heated debate saw opposition legislators reject government plans for Kenya to lead the multinational policing team in Haiti, saying it violated the country's constitution. Supporters of the motion said Kenya had a moral obligation and duty to aid Haiti.

The key issues in the debate were who would fund the deployment and what justifications there are for sending security forces to Haiti, thousands of miles from Kenya.

""Where is the sense in taking 1,000 police officers to Haiti when Kenyans are dying, in need of protection, in need of service from their police officers,"" argued opposition lawmaker Rozzah Buya.

Gabriel Tongoya, who chairs parliament's committee on administration and internal security, said all costs of the deployment would be funded by the United Nations.

Interior Minister Kithure Kindiki last week told parliament that Kenya will only deploy the officers to Haiti if funding and equipment was paid for by U.N. member states.

Violence has escalated in Haiti as a heavily armed gang surrounded a hospital in the capital of Port-au-Prince on Wednesday, trapping patients who included 40 children and newborns. Police later rescued the patients.

Prime Minister Rishi Sunak has said he is aiming for the first removal flights to leave in the spring, after delivering reforms to the flagship policy, which has been ruled unlawful by the Supreme Court.

But Jeremy Hunt refused to commit to migrants who arrive via unauthorised means being sent to the east African country in 2024.

Speaking to broadcasters on Thursday, the Chancellor said: ""We are hopeful that because of the solutions that the Prime Minister announced yesterday we will be able to get flights off to Rwanda next year.

""We can't guarantee that.

""We have to pass legislation, emergency legislation, in the House of Commons (and) we have to sign a new international treaty with Rwanda.""

The Government is working to broker a new legally binding treaty on top of the £140 million deal already struck with Kigali after five top justices ruled against the policy on Wednesday.

Emergency legislation aimed at ensuring the Rwanda scheme can go ahead by deeming it a ""safe country"", despite the Supreme Court's concerns over risks to asylum seekers who are sent there, will be produced ""in the coming weeks"", Downing Street has said.

Mr Hunt said that, while the Supreme Court ruling was a ""setback"", ministers ""would not allow anything to get in the way of delivering the Prime Minister's pledge"" to put a stop to small boats of migrants crossing the Channel to Britain.

Mr Sunak has made ""stopping the boats"" one of his five pledges to the electorate ahead of the next election.

The threat of being deported to Rwanda has been regularly touted by the Conservative Party leader and other senior Government figures as one of the ways that can help deliver the commitment.

Pressed on whether deportation flights could take off before voters next go to the polls to elect a Westminster government, Mr Hunt said: ""We can't give a precise date as to when those flights will happen.

""But no-one should be in any doubt that we will do what it takes to secure our borders and stop the vile people-smuggling business and stop the small boats.""

The next election is expected to be held next year, with Mr Sunak needing to call a vote by January 2025.

Home Secretary James Cleverly, during broadcast interviews on Thursday, said he was ""absolutely determined"" to get a removal flight off the runway before the next election.

Mr Cleverly said MPs could ratify the new Rwanda treaty once it is agreed and pass new laws within days.

The yet-to-be-published treaty with Rwanda is expected to attempt to address the Supreme Court's concerns around refoulement - the potential for refugees whose applications for asylum are rejected by Kigali to be sent back to the country they are fleeing from.

Under pressure from sacked home secretary Suella Braverman and the right of the Conservative Party, Mr Sunak has kept the threat of pulling out of the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) on the table for the future in his battle to deport migrants.

But Mr Cleverly said he did not think withdrawing from the convention would be needed, saying instead that the focus should be on reform.

The Government is expected to face opposition to its plans in the House of Lords, where former Supreme Court judge Jonathan Sumption sits.

Lord Sumption told the BBC the plan to use a law to declare Rwanda as safe is ""constitutionally really quite extraordinary"" and would ""effectively overrule"" a decision by the UK's highest court.","{'uri': 'independent.co.uk', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'The Independent'}",[],https://static.independent.co.uk/2023/11/16/18/6125255e55f50816baabc01cc5d00609Y29udGVudHNlYXJjaGFwaSwxNzAwMjQ1NTQ3-2.74149104.jpg?quality=75&width=1200&auto=webp,eng-9063836,0.05098039215686279,25,25,The Independent,independent.co.uk

(AP) - Lawyers for Memphis Grizzlies guard Ja Morant are allowed to argue that he was acting in self-defense as part of a lawsuit accusing him of assaulting a teenager during a pickup basketball game at the NBA star's house, a judge ruled Thursday.

Circuit Court Judge Carol Chumney set a Dec. 11 hearing where lawyers for Morant and 18-year-old Joshua Holloway will discuss whether Morant is immune from liability under Tennessee law for hitting Holloway during a game at the All-Star player´s Memphis-area home in July 2022.

Morant´s lawyers have acknowledged he punched Holloway one time after Holloway threw a basketball at Morant and the ball hit Morant in the chin. In a July 26 motion, the player´s lawyers said he should be immune from liability under the state´s ""stand your ground"" law, which allows people who feel threatened at their homes to act with force in certain situations.

The law is used in criminal cases, but Chumney's ruling clears the way for Morant's lawyers to apply it in the civil case and attempt to have the lawsuit dismissed.

Morant´s accuser was 17 when the lawsuit was filed. It accuses Morant and friend Davonte Pack of assault, reckless endangerment, abuse or neglect, and infliction of emotional distress. An amended complaint identified the plaintiff as Holloway.

Morant filed a countersuit accusing Holloway of slander, battery and assault. No criminal charges have been filed against Morant. Pack has been charged with misdemeanor assault, and a hearing is set for Nov. 21 in state criminal court.

The lawsuit has led to complicated legal arguments, including disagreement about whether the state´s ""stand your ground"" law can be used to support Morant.

Holloway´s lawyer, Rebecca Adelman, has argued that the self-defense claim under the state law can´t be a reason to dismiss the civil case, partly because there is no ongoing criminal investigation against Morant. She has argued that Holloway has a right to a jury trial, which would not take place if the judge finds that Morant is immune.

Adelman has said the self-defense and immunity arguments came too late in the process. At a July hearing, she called it a ""Hail Mary of Hail Marys.""

Will Perry, Morant´s lawyer, has argued there are ways for the ""stand your ground"" law to apply in civil cases and that Morant is entitled to immunity. He has said the motion was timely because the trial is not scheduled until April 2024.

Lawyers for Morant and Holloway did not provide comment to reporters after the court hearing Thursday.

The NBA suspended Morant for the first 25 games this season after a video of him flashing a handgun was posted online. The video of Morant showing a gun while sitting in the passenger seat of a car was posted after he finished serving an eight-game suspension in March for a video in which he displayed a handgun in a Denver-area strip club.

Morant apologized for both videos.","{'uri': 'dailymail.co.uk', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'Daily Mail Online'}",[],https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2023/11/16/19/wire-77896031-1700161253-481_636x382.jpg,eng-9068550,-0.4196078431372549,25,25,Daily Mail Online,dailymail.co.uk

The Jails and Justice Support Center (JJSC) has a mission of assisting jails ""in creating and sustaining safe, humane, and effective environments"" by working directly with jails to provide training and technical assistance, as well as providing referrals to other federal programs.

Associate Attorney General Vanita Gupta, the No. 3 official at the Justice Department, told NBC News in an interview that the department felt it was important to partner with law enforcement figures in the field and that the initiative is a reflection of what sheriffs and jail administrators said they need. Jails are ""at the frontlines"" of some of society's most difficult issues, Gupta said, adding that the smallest jails are often those in need of the most assistance.

The Justice Department has the ability to investigate individual jails when they find patterns and practices that violate constitutional rights. But the Jails and Justice Support Center is akin to preventative medicine, aimed at trying to proactively help jail administrators deal with issues on the front end, rather than investigating them on the back end.

The project is modeled after the Collaborative Reform Initiative -- a DOJ effort launched during the Obama administration in the wake of the unrest in cities like Ferguson, Missouri, after the 2014 death of Michael Brown and in Baltimore after the 2015 killing of Freddie Gray -- as well as the Law Enforcement Knowledge Lab, which DOJ launched last year.

Gupta, a progressive civil rights attorney who received support from major law enforcement organizations during her 2021 nomination, announced the launch of the hub at an event at the Arlington County Sheriff's Office in Virginia on Wednesday. Ahead of the launch, Gupta told NBC News that a comprehensive approach in collaboration with jail administrators would be the most effective and help deal with a variety of issues faced by law enforcement, including the recruitment and retention crisis that particularly impacts some of the lower-paying law enforcement jobs at jails.

Gupta said what they heard from the field was that jails needed ""real-time best practices and technical assistance."" Jail leaders and DOJ have the same goal, she said, ""which is safe facilities where the dignity, humanity, constitutional rights of everyone -- and that covers people who are incarcerated, the staff, people who are visiting jails -- are upheld and honored.""

It's similar to the work DOJ has done on policing, Gupta said.

""There will be a lot of learning from consent decrees, but also from sheriffs that are doing very innovative work around substance use disorders, use of Medicaid dollars to better help transition people who are leaving their facilities into community-based treatment, addressing the needs of people with behavioral and mental health disorders and practices that keep staff and incarcerated people safe,"" she said. ""Sheriffs are the first to tell you that they have been saddled with some of these really difficult social problems and that jails are at the frontlines of some of these difficult issues.""","{'uri': 'nbcnews.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'NBC News'}",[],"https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_nbcnews-fp-1024-512,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2023-11/231115-prison-cell-mjf-1751-257d19.jpg",,0.3333333333333333,25,25,NBC News,nbcnews.com

Italy's plan to send tens of thousands of migrants and refugees to Albania does not breach European Union law, officials in Brussels have ruled.

Albania is not an EU state and so its rules on asylum seekers do not apply to the Balkan nation, said the bloc's most senior official on migration.

Ylva Johansson, EU migration commissioner, said: ""The preliminary assessment by our legal service is that this is not violating EU law, it's outside EU law. EU law is not applicable outside EU territory.""

Ms Johansson's remarks imply that the scheme announced last week by Giorgia Meloni, the Italian prime minister, and Edi Rama, her Albanian counterpart, could not be challenged before the EU Court of Justice.

Under the accord, the Italians have been given permission to build two migrant centres in northern Albania.

Migrants transferred to holding facility

Migrants trying to cross the Mediterranean in boats from North Africa will be intercepted by the Italian navy or coastguard and brought to the port of Shengjin, a holiday resort where the Italians will build a reception centre.

They will then be transferred inland to a large holding facility built on an old Albanian air force base next to the village of Gjader.

About 3,000 a month will be processed. If their asylum applications are rejected, they will be repatriated to their home countries.

The Meloni government hopes the system will be able to handle about 36,000 migrants a year.

The bilateral accord has drawn comparisons with the British Government's plan to send asylum seekers to Rwanda, which was ruled to be unlawful by the Supreme Court on Wednesday.

The Italy-Albania plan has been criticised by human rights groups as well as opposition parties in both countries.

The two migrant facilities, which are due to open in the spring, will operate under Italian jurisdiction with Italian personnel.

So far this year, more than 147,000 migrants have arrived in Italy and the Meloni government is desperate to make good on electoral promises to stop the boats and get on top of the situation.

The Albania plan could act as a deterrent to prospective migrants, foiling their hopes of reaching the EU.

On Wednesday, Albania's government put forth a draft law on the five-year deal with Italy.

It will be debated and voted on in the 140-seat parliament, where Mr Rama's governing Socialists have 74 seats. It is not clear when the vote will be held.

As Italy struggles to handle the huge number of migrant arrivals, another 1,400 reached the tiny southern island of Lampedusa in 24 hours between Tuesday and Wednesday.

The migrant reception centre on the island is frequently overcrowded, with migrants sleeping on the ground and in scrubland outside its perimeter fence.","{'uri': 'telegraph.co.uk', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'The Telegraph'}","[{'uri': 'nick_squires@telegraph.co.uk', 'name': 'Nick Squires', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': False}]",https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/world-news/2023/11/16/TELEMMGLPICT000355759258_17001549738150_trans_NvBQzQNjv4Bq6BstALpMiKOXM0sIUAWNCNf11FLKtqwYaxK652uKeQE.jpeg?impolicy=logo-overlay,eng-9064144,0.0980392156862746,25,25,The Telegraph,telegraph.co.uk

But this isn't the end of the story - a version of the plan is likely to resurface in some form.

The initial reactions from the Prime Minister, Rishi Sunak, and his new Home Secretary, James Cleverly, shed light on where the Government plans to take this next.

After months of legal challenges, the UK Supreme Court ruled that the Rwanda plan was unlawful. The ruling was not about the concept of off-shoring the asylum process to another country. Rather, it found that Rwanda in particular is not currently a ""safe country"" in which to do this.

The court found that people sent to Rwanda would be at risk of ill-treatment and forcible return to the countries they had fled in search of protection.

In a statement in the Commons, Sunak made it clear that his Government was intent on ploughing on, and that his commitment to stopping small boat crossings was ""unwavering"". He also stressed that Rwanda was only part of the overall strategy on ""illegal migration"" that he intends to see implemented, and that the strategy is already working with irregular crossings declining.

Most telling is the emphasis Sunak placed on the court's ruling indicating that the principle of sending people to a safe third country is lawful. ""This confirms the Government's clear view from the outset,"" he said.

In other words: our thinking is right, all we need to do is either find another country that the courts will deem ""safe"", or make Rwanda ""safe"" by law to implement the plan. Both routes are already being pursued.

The search for alternative safe countries has been ongoing for months. This has involved official visits by ministers including Suella Braverman, and memorandums of understanding with countries like Turkey and Albania.

Sunak has also announced a new treaty with Rwanda as part of the plan, and emergency legislation to declare it a ""safe third country"" in law.

But this would still likely face legal challenges going up to the European Court of Human Rights, which interprets and upholds the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR).

In announcing the emergency legislation, Sunak said that he would ""not allow a foreign court to block these flights"" to Rwanda.

The political battle over the European court is an arguably fundamental part of this story. Since conception, the Rwanda plan was, for some, there to test the boundaries of the law and act as a Trojan horse for the Conservative right to push the UK outside the ECHR.

However, a key point from the supreme court ruling is worth emphasising here. While reading his summary of the judgment, Lord Reed noted that the ECHR is only one part of the relevant legal framework. So, even if the UK did leave, there are several UK and international laws that would still get in the way of removing people to Rwanda.

Another approach: exporting immigration detention

Up to now, the Government has framed the Rwanda plan as fulfilling a dual purpose: a deterrent - if people know they risk forced removal to Rwanda by crossing the Channel, they would not make the journey - and as a tool to manage the spiralling backlog of asylum claims.

But the response to the Supreme Court ruling may lead to a shift, moving the purpose away from managing the asylum processing system, and more towards managing migrants who breach immigration law. The latter route is backed up by the new Illegal Migration Act, which increases sanctions for irregular crossing and human smuggling.

This would mean separating the removal to Rwanda from the asylum process, and instead using it as a place to expand the UK's immigration detention capacity.

While likely to face legal challenges, there is already a template for this: the controversial plan announced in October to rent prison cells overseas ""to ensure dangerous offenders can be locked up for longer"".

Where does this leave the Rwanda plan, or any future iteration?

Arguably, the implementation of the plan was never the priority - and it could hardly be sold as a one-size-fits-all solution. While politically, the plan has been very effective in mobilising Conservative membership, logistically it is a different story.

Even if implemented, Rwanda would be able to host (at a high price) only a fraction of those the UK Government deems subject to removal.

Both Sunak and Cleverly have been at pains to highlight their plan has inspired similar approaches in Europe (namely Italy, Germany, Austria and Denmark). Despite this major legal blow, they still very much see themselves as leading the way in immigration solutions.","{'uri': 'express.co.uk', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'EXPRESS'}",[],https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/41/1200x712/5070322.jpg,eng-9063836,0.1372549019607843,25,25,EXPRESS,express.co.uk

While there have been individual cases linked to Syria’s civil war, there has been frustration in the West at the lack of a wider plan for international justice

The UN’s top court on Thursday ruled that Syria must stop its torture programme that investigators say killed tens of thousands, in the first international case over the brutal civil war that began in 2011.

The International Court of Justice said Syria must “take all measures within its power to prevent acts of torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment”.

The court also ruled that Syria must “prevent the destruction and ensure the preservation of any evidence” relating to torture.

Canada and the Netherlands had called on the ICJ to “urgently” order a halt to torture in Syrian jails, arguing that “every day counts” for those still in detention.

The ruling comes after France issued an international arrest warrant for Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, accused of complicity in crimes against humanity over chemical attacks in 2013.

In October, judges at the ICJ in The Hague heard searing testimony from Syrian detainees describing gang rape, mutilation and punishment involving contorting people into a car tyre and beating them.

The court was asked to issue “provisional measures” to stop torture and arbitrary detention in Syria, open prisons to outside inspectors and provide information to families about the fate of their loved ones.

Torture in Syria is “pervasive and entrenched … and continues today”, Canada and the Netherlands wrote in their submission to the ICJ.Syrian first lady thanks China for support, halting plans ‘still being hatched’

Victims endure “unimaginable physical and mental pain and suffering as a result of acts of torture, including abhorrent treatment in detention … and sexual and gender-based violence”, the submission added.

“Tens of thousands have died, or are presumed dead, as a result of torture,” the two countries added, citing a report from the UN Human Rights Council.

Damascus snubbed the October hearing but has previously dismissed the case as “disinformation and lies” and said the allegations “lack the slightest degree of credibility”.

“It is our sincere belief that the lives and well-being of Syrians are at stake and require the court’s immediate attention,” said Rene Lefeber, top representative for the Netherlands, at the hearing on October 10.

While there have been individual war crimes cases linked to the Syrian war in some countries, there has long been frustration in Western capitals at the lack of any wider plan for international justice.

The Dutch first launched a bid in September 2020 to hold Syria responsible for alleged breaches of the United Nations Convention against Torture, to which Damascus is a signatory. Canada joined the case the following March.

The International Criminal Court (ICC) – a war crimes court which, like the ICJ, is based in The Hague – has been unable to deal with Syria because Damascus never ratified the Rome Statute, the tribunal’s founding treaty.

The situation has gained renewed attention after the return of Assad to the international fold in May, when he attended an Arab League summit.","{'uri': 'scmp.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'South China Morning Post'}",[],https://cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/d8/video/thumbnail/2021/03/10/thumbnail_webyt_clean.jpg?itok=nIqnZi_g,eng-9067706,-0.8352941176470589,25,25,South China Morning Post,scmp.com

A misconduct investigation was launched after it was decided the case did not meet the requirements for a criminal prosecution.

A Metropolitan Police officer has been dismissed for gross misconduct after sexual activity with an underage runaway child who was reported missing.

The officer - granted anonymity and named only as Officer A - ""exploited and abused"" the child after making contact with them on social media and arranging to meet them on 16 August 2019, a misconduct hearing was told.

They engaged in sexual activity with the child on several occasions between 16-27 August and allowed them to stay on 26 August without informing police or social services.

The following day, 27 August, Officer A asked the child to attend Romford Police Station in east London as a ""missing person"" - but ask for them, but keep their relationship secret.

Officer A failed to make a formal police record that the missing child had been found, the hearing was told.

It was only then that the child was taken by Officer A to social services.

An allegation of serious sexual assault was made against Officer A in September 2019, with a full criminal investigation then launched before the officer was suspended from duty and later arrested.

However, the Crown Prosecution Service, after reviewing the evidence, decided the case did not meet the requirements for a criminal prosecution.

The decision was challenged by the Victim's Right of Review process but was dismissed.

But officers from the Metropolitan Police's directorate of professional standards continued a misconduct investigation and decided there was a case to answer, ahead of a full misconduct hearing.

A misconduct panel found Officer A had breached police standards of professional behaviour regarding discreditable conduct, duties and responsibilities, and honesty and integrity.

The panel, led by an independent, legally qualified chair, determined the officer should be sacked without notice.

Chief Superintendent Stuart Bell, of the East Area Command Unit, said: ""This officer betrayed their role as a police officer and their oath to uphold the law by exploiting and abusing a child, who was below the age of consent.

The Biden administration said in a ""statement of interest"" filed in Nashville, Tennessee, federal court on Wednesday that the judge should reject motions by RealPage and dozens of corporate landlords to throw out the cases.

The Justice Department is not a party in the litigation, but said it intends to participate at a Dec. 11 hearing where RealPage and others will ask the court to dismiss the renters' lawsuits.

The cases in April were consolidated in Nashville as part of multidistrict litigation. The defendants have denied wrongdoing, and RealPage has called the alleged conspiracy ""implausible.""

The class-action lawsuits on behalf of students and other renters claim landlords have shared non-public information -- including vacancy data -- with RealPage and relied on its algorithms to keep rental prices inflated above competitive levels.

The government's filing called algorithms ""the new frontier"" of price-fixing, and argued that the use of shared data and software must ""be subject to the same condemnation"" as other price-fixing schemes.

""Longstanding legal principles apply with equal force to this new machinery,"" the Justice Department said.

A spokesperson for Texas-based RealPage on Thursday did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The defense motions to dismiss are pending before Chief U.S. District Judge Waverly Crenshaw Jr.

RealPage is owned by Chicago-based private equity firm Thoma Bravo, which has called the plaintiffs' claims ""threadbare."" Thoma Bravo did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

The Justice Department declined to comment.

Lawsuits against RealPage and large property management companies began piling up last year. The plaintiffs said they have evidence from confidential witnesses to help buttress their claims of a price-fixing conspiracy.

The District of Columbia on Nov. 1 became the first governmental entity to sue RealPage over its pricing software. The District, working with a private law firm, alleged residents had paid ""millions of dollars above fair market prices.""

The case is In re: RealPage Rental Software Antitrust Litigation, U.S. District Court, Middle District of Tennessee, No. 23-md-03071.

With investors' earnings at risk, the Supreme Court will soon decide -- in the case SEC v. Jarkesy -- whether to disable the Securities and Exchange Commission's administrative enforcement proceedings, one of the major enforcement mechanisms targeting securities fraud in the United States.

First, some background on the action before the Supreme Court: In 2011, the SEC began investigating George Jarkesy, a founder of two hedge funds, and his investment adviser, Patriot28, for misrepresenting the funds' investment strategies. Two years later, the SEC brought an administrative proceeding against Jarkesy before an administrative law judge (ALJ), who found that Jarkesy and Patriot28 had violated the Securities Act, the Exchange Act, and the Advisers Act. The SEC issued its own decision with the same findings and imposed a cease-and-desist order and a $300,000 penalty on Jarkesy and Patriot28.

Jarkesy challenged not only the findings but the process for reaching them. This process was expanded in the 2010 Dodd-Frank Act, which increased the SEC's ability to seek penalties through SEC administrative proceedings, broadening their reach to include publicly-traded companies and their personnel. The expansion appeared to have an immediate effect, with the percentage of actions brought through administrative proceedings tripling in the years right after Dodd-Frank Act's passage -- from 21% in 2010 to 76% in 2015.

A 2020 study by Xin Zheng, a Professor at the University of British Columbia, found that these SEC administrative proceedings resolve cases in, on average, just 10 days -- nearly 27 times faster than SEC actions brought in federal court -- and result in settlement 99% of the time. Zheng's study further found that the SEC was able to bring more enforcement actions generally post-Dodd Frank due to the agency's expanded ability to bring actions through administrative proceedings. Xin Zheng, ""A Tale of Two Enforcement Venues: Determinants and Consequences of the SEC's Choice of Enforcement Venue After the Dodd-Frank Act"" (The Accounting Review, conditionally accepted).

In his appeal to the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, Jarkesy argued that SEC administrative proceedings are unconstitutional. The 5th Circuit ruled in Jarkesy's favor, holding that (1) Jarkesy was entitled to a jury trial under the Seventh Amendment of the Constitution; (2) Congress had unconstitutionally delegated lawmaking power to the SEC by allowing it to seek civil penalties through administrative proceedings; and (3) the SEC's appointment of ALJs with lifetime tenure violated Article II of the Constitution.

The SEC appealed the 5th Circuit's decision to the Supreme Court, arguing that (1) Congress did not violate the Seventh Amendment by authorizing the SEC to seek civil penalties through administrative proceedings because the securities claims involve ""public rights"" which, under Article III, may be adjudicated outside a federal court; (2) the ""non-delegation"" doctrine did not bar the SEC from bringing administrative proceedings because those proceedings are a form of executive discretion, not a form of lawmaking authority; and (3) Article II does not bar ALJs from receiving tenure protection because ALJs are ""inferior officers"" and thus Congress may restrict their removal.

The Supreme Court took the case and is scheduled to hear oral argument on Nov. 29, 2023. Over 35 amici have filed briefs weighing in on these issues. Groups of administrative law scholars and the American Bar Association filed briefs in support of the SEC; meanwhile, attorneys general from 18 states, along with high-profile individuals like Mark Cuban and Elon Musk, filed briefs in support of Jarkesy. The Supreme Court is expected to issue a decision sometime next year.

As oral argument before the Supreme Court approaches, focus among legal scholars will likely -- and understandably -- be on the contours of the ""non-delegation"" doctrine, which has wide-ranging implications on the ability of federal agencies, including the SEC, to exercise their authority. However, those most focused on uprooting corporate fraud understand that Jarkesy could also mark a new era of securities enforcement.

Under the current legal landscape, SEC enforcement actions constitute one of two major mechanisms that investors rely on for the deterrence and punishment of securities fraud -- the other is private securities actions brought by the injured shareholders themselves. While both sets of actions target the same behavior, they operate in different ways. For example, the SEC has broad subpoena power to support its investigations, enabling it to gather information quickly and without the delays of civil discovery. In contrast, private securities class actions are brought in court by the injured investors and proceed through the regular course of discovery and litigation.

Currently, these actions often work in complement to one another. Complaints filed by shareholders and their attorneys may prompt the SEC to launch its own investigations and proceedings. Similarly, the fruits of an SEC investigation may sometimes help plaintiff shareholders meet their pleading burden to survive a motion to dismiss and ultimately establish intent, a requirement in proving securities fraud.

To be sure, a decision by the Supreme Court against the SEC would likely alter this landscape, but it would not leave investors wholly unprotected. First, the Supreme Court will only decide the fate of the SEC's administrative enforcement proceedings -- meaning that no matter which way the Court rules, the SEC will still have authority to bring enforcement actions in federal court.

While the SEC has increasingly made administrative proceedings an equal -- and, in some years, preferred -- forum for enforcement actions, an adverse decision in Jarkesy should not keep the Commission from investigating and penalizing securities fraud.

Second, even without the benefit of concurrent SEC investigations, securities class actions provide, as the Supreme Court has repeatedly noted, ""a most effective weapon in the enforcement of the securities laws."" See Stoneridge Investment Partners, LLC v. Scientific-Atlanta, Inc. 552 U.S. 148 (2008); Bateman-Eichler, Hill Richards, Inc. v. Berner, 472 U.S. 299 (1985).

SEC v. Jarkesy comes before the Supreme Court at a time when corporate fraud and its impacts on investors are attracting much-deserved attention. A study this year from the University of Chicago Booth School of Business estimates that on average 10 percent of public companies commit securities fraud and that only one-third of corporate fraud is detected. ""How pervasive is corporate fraud?"" A study from the University of Chicago Booth School of Business, A. Dyck, A. Morse, L. Zingales, Review of Accounting Studies, January 2023.

As investors and their attorneys seek to become ever more vigilant about holding corporations accountable, the Jarkesy case will be one to watch.","{'uri': 'reuters.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'Reuters'}",[],https://www.reuters.com/resizer/VXYOqbsXwdxSEZtqlLztPzsB_F0=/800x419/smart/filters:quality(80)/cloudfront-us-east-2.images.arcpublishing.com/reuters/JWEQ6JL6BBJG5KXXB63H4NHGEE.jpg,,0.02745098039215677,25,25,Reuters,reuters.com

Graham Phillips, who is living in Ukraine, was made the subject of an ""asset freeze"" in July 2022 - a decision upheld on ""ministerial review"" in February, a judge has been told.

Lawyers representing Mr Phillips have taken legal action against Foreign Secretary David Cameron - and say the decision was ""Orwellian"" and should be quashed.

Mr Justice Swift, who heard that Mr Phillips had expressed ""political opinions"" on YouTube and social media to a ""primarily UK domestic audience"", finished overseeing a High Court hearing, in the Royal Court of Justice complex, on Thursday.

He said he aimed to deliver a ruling in the near future.

The judge was told that Liz Truss had been Foreign Secretary when the decision was taken and James Cleverly was Foreign Secretary when it was upheld on review.

Ministers are fighting Mr Phillips' bid to lift sanctions.

Lawyers representing Mr Cameron argued that decisions taken were correct and said Mr Phillips' claim should be dismissed.

Mr Phillips was the ""first mono-British"" national to be ""subjected to sanctions by the British Government"", a barrister leading his legal team told the judge.

This serious interference with the rights of a British citizen, brought about by an act of executive fiat purely for expressing their views, is Orwellian irrespective of the offensiveness of the views concerned Joshua Hitchens

Joshua Hitchens said ministers had not accused Mr Phillipa of any crime, of being part of ""Russian State apparatus"", of ""advancing the Russian war effort"" in Ukraine, or of supporting the Russian economy.

He said Mr Phillips' designation stemmed ""entirely"" from ""political opinions expressed on YouTube and social media to a primarily UK domestic audience"".

Mr Hitchens argued that Mr Phillips' ""designation"" was ""disproportionate"" and ""Orwellian"".

""The power the (Foreign Secretary) claims to possess is expansive and unprecedented in modern British political and legal history,"" he said in a written case outline.

""The defendant's position is that he has the power to designate British citizens lawfully exercising their right to freedom of expression on matters of political controversy.

""The effect of such designation is to deprive the subject of access to their possessions, their ability to earn a living and their capacity to meet even their most basic needs.

""A British national subject to an asset freeze is effectively excommunicated from the economy.

""This serious interference with the rights of a British Citizen, brought about by an act of executive fiat purely for expressing their views, is Orwellian

irrespective of the offensiveness of the views concerned.""

Mr Phillips, who watched the hearing from Ukraine via video link, was mentioned in a debate in the Lords in June 2022.

Labour former defence secretary Lord Browne of Ladyton was asked whether the Government had launched an investigation into Mr Phillips.

The ruling came after news outlets this week reported on the contents of and published clips from interviews that four defendants conducted with prosecutors as part of their plea deals.

Fulton County Superior Court Judge Scott McAfee wrote that allowing parties the ""unfettered ability"" to publicly share pretrial materials undermines the discovery process, during which lawyers for both sides share evidence. ""Potential jurors should be limited from exposure to materials that may be deemed inadmissible at trial,"" McAfee wrote.

""The likelihood of harm in this case is severe, as extensive media coverage guarantees broad dissemination of any disclosed discovery materials,"" McAfee wrote.

Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis had initially asked for an order prohibiting the disclosure of any of the evidence shared with the defense. But prosecutors told the judge during a remote hearing Wednesday they agreed with a more narrowly focused order proposed by one of the defendants.

A lawyer for a coalition of news outlets, including The Associated Press, argued during the hearing against any protective order, saying such a step requires the showing of a substantial threat of physical or economic harm to a witness - and that this burden had not been met.

Trump and 18 other people were charged in August with participating in a wide-ranging scheme to illegally try to keep the then-Republican president in power after his 2020 loss to Democrat Joe Biden. Four people have pleaded guilty after reaching deals with prosecutors. The remaining 15 have pleaded not guilty. No trial date has been set.

McAfee's order instructs prosecutors to review their discovery and designate as ""sensitive materials"" anything they believe should not be disclosed. Defendants will have 14 days after receiving the discovery to contest that designation. If the two sides cannot agree on whether it is appropriate, the judge will decide. The evidence would not be disclosed until he has ruled.

The protective order does not apply to information or records that are publicly available, that the defendants obtain in another way or that has been field or received as evidence in another court proceeding.

Defense attorney Jonathan Miller, who represents former Coffee County elections director Misty Hampton, told the judge he had released the videos of the interviews to one media outlet, but did not identify it. The Washington Post and ABC News reported on the videos Monday.

The interviews, called proffers, gave a glimpse into what kind of testimony might be offered at trial by the four people who pleaded guilty: lawyers Sidney Powell, Kenneth Chesebro and Jenna Ellis, and bail bondsman and Trump supporter Scott Hall.

Miller said he believes that the interviews with two of those people - Powell and Hall - could be helpful to his client and argued that the public had the right to see what they said.

The date for the verdict was announced at the end of Justice Minister Eric Dupond-Moretti´s two-week trial. He has refused to resign but could do so if found guilty on conflict of interest charges.

The minister consistently denied wrongdoing during the trial and called the case against him ""illegitimate.""

""I had no desire to settle scores with anyone,"" he said.

Prosecutor Rémy Heitz accused the minister of abuse of power and asked the court to impose a 1-year suspended prison sentence.

Once a high-profile lawyer, Dupond-Moretti is accused of abusing his position to order probes targeting magistrates who investigated him, his friends and his former clients. He faces up to five years in prison and a half-million euros ($537,000) in fines if convicted on charges of illegal conflict of interest.

The trial marked the first time in modern France that a government minister was put on trial while still in office, according to legal historians.

He was tried in a special court for alleged wrongdoing by the government, the Court of Justice of the Republic. He faced three professional magistrates accompanied by 12 members of parliament - six from the lower house and six from the Senate - who will issue the ruling.

The chief judge of the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, Priscilla Richman, in an order on Wednesday said further action was ""unnecessary"" after Jones last month submitted his resignation as a Southern District of Texas bankruptcy judge.

Jones announced plans to resign on Oct. 15 after acknowledging to the Wall Street Journal that he had been in a years-long romantic relationship with bankruptcy attorney Elizabeth Freeman and shared a home with her.

Freeman until recently worked at Jackson Walker, a local law firm that worked on many corporate bankruptcy cases in Jones' Houston courthouse.

Jones' resignation came shortly after the 5th Circuit had launched an ethics inquiry and Richman's filing on Oct. 13 of a misconduct complaint that found there was probable cause to believe Jones violated the codes of conduct that govern judges.

Richman's complaint said Jones never recused himself from cases involving Jackson Walker or disclosed his relationship with Freeman. He also approved attorneys' fees sought by the firm for work on matters in which billing records showed Freeman performed ""substantial"" services, Richman said.

Jones and Freeman's lawyer did not respond to requests for comment. Vikram Chandhok, the 5th Circuit's chief mediator, declined to elaborate beyond Wednesday's order.

Wednesday's order ending the investigation came the same day Jones' resignation became effective. Only sitting judges, and not former ones, can be subject to remedial action under the Judicial Conduct and Disability Act of 1980 and related rules.

Those regulations, though, would have permitted the 5th Circuit Judicial Council to still assess ""potential institutional issues"" related to the complaint even if Jones could no longer himself be disciplined.

The 10th Circuit Judicial Council, for example, relied on that authority last year as part of a probe into a then-New Mexico magistrate judge's workplace environment to still examine institutional issues even after her term on the bench expired.

The U.S. Department of Justice's bankruptcy watchdog, the Office of the U.S. Trustee, is seeking to force Jackson Walker to return fees it earned in cases Jones presided over. It said the firm earned about $13 million in at least 26 such cases, including J.C. Penney's and Neiman Marcus' bankruptcies.

The 500-lawyer law firm in filings on Monday said that after learning of the allegations in 2021 from a disgruntled litigant, it confronted Freeman, who said she had ended her relationship with Jones the prior year. The firm said it sent the allegations to the Houston bankruptcy court under seal.

The 38-year-old Camarillo native settled in a small community outside Dallas, where she and her husband bought a house big enough for their family of eight that they could never afford in Southern California. She also knew Texas has no state income tax. Gas for their vehicles is a lot cheaper.

What Balek did not realize, however, was just how drastically different the state laws and regulations are on employment and related issues. And those unrecognized differences can turn out to matter. Sometimes a lot.

Balek still works for the same California employer of nearly 20 years, but by moving her residence to another state, she faces the possibility of losing or getting significantly diminished benefits and protections. California is one of the most progressive when it comes to employee rights.

Employees working in California, for example, are entitled to a minimum of five paid sick days annually starting next year, up from three currently, under a new law signed recently. Neither Texas nor most other states require private employers to provide any sick leave benefits -- paid or unpaid -- to their employees.

California is one of a dozen states with paid family leave, with a maximum six to 20 weeks. Most others don't. The same goes for time off for bereavement and for parents to attend their children's school activities, though generally not paid. There's also reimbursement for remote employees for their work-related expenses.

Besides leaves of absence, states have different laws on short-term disability, workers' compensation and various wage and hour rules, as well as employment protections such as discrimination.

Balek said that she assumes she will have most of the same benefits and rights in Texas that she had in California. But unlike her job, they're not often portable. The reality is that some protections apply only to those residing in California.

Others fall in a gray area where the courts are now deciding a growing number of disputes that have arisen as countless people have moved to new and often distant locations to be closer to families, improve their housing situation or achieve other personal goals. Many employment laws were written without remote work in mind.

""We're getting a lot of calls from [out-of-state] people who want to sue under California law,"" said Julian Burns King of the Los Angeles employment law firm King & Siegel.

""If their employer is based here in California, they think maybe California law applies even though they work remotely somewhere else in the country,"" she said. ""Sometimes remote workers in California aren't sure what California law applies to their claims as their company is based elsewhere and all of their bosses are based elsewhere.""

No matter where one lives or works, there's a wide range of federal laws for employers and employees. But some benefits are covered only by states, and others can be much more favorable for workers than comparable federal ones.

As a general rule, the state where you live governs employment rules and determines whether you're eligible for most benefits.

During the pandemic, many Americans used the federal Family and Medical Leave Act, which gives employees up to 12 weeks of unpaid, job-protected leave to care for a sick family member.

California has a similar version of that but also has a separate paid family leave provision that enables employees to receive as much as 70% of their regular pay for up to eight weeks -- and not just to care for a sick family member but also to bond with a new child or in certain cases of a military deployment.

The benefit is paid from state disability insurance funds collected through automatic payroll deductions. Workers living in California pay that tax -- about 1.1% of their wages. And only those who pay into that system can take advantage of it.

It's the same when it comes to benefits to workers for non-work-related illnesses and injuries, which are also covered under disability. California is one of only five states that requires employers to provide short-term disability insurance to workers. And California's is especially generous: employees can get partial replacement wages of up to $1,620 weekly for a maximum of 52 weeks.

That fund also applies to California's unique pregnancy leave allowing up to four months of job-protected time off, part of which can be paid due to a medical condition or limitations to doing one's job. In all these cases, out-of-state workers generally aren't eligible for cash benefits even if they work for a California company or bosses.

What happens if you're an out-of-state remote employee and you hurt yourself falling down the stairs during a water break at home?

For starters, the law of the state where you were injured -- that is, where you were working -- probably will apply, said Amy Puckett, a senior attorney at Bradley Arant Boult Cummings, an Alabama-based firm. Workers' comp laws are state specific, and a court in one state might rule that such an injury qualifies for workers' comp while another might say it's not work-related enough.

California, New York and Illinois are among the states with the strongest workers' comp laws. They require employers to provide coverage for virtually all employees, including out-of-state remote workers. And they can face severe penalties for failing to buy workers' comp insurance.

In contrast, workers' comp coverage is optional for private employers in Texas, and some other states have numerous exclusions. Employees in California also can claim benefits faster -- just three days after an injury versus seven for Florida, Texas and most others.

Many states and cities have minimum pay and other wage rules such as on overtime. Generally they apply to people who work in those places. So if you're fully working outside of California, you won't be covered by the state's wage and hour laws.

But what if you're coming into your employer's California headquarters regularly for meetings? Or you work some days in the California office and some days of the week from home located across state lines? Three of every 10 full-time employees today work on a hybrid schedule.

In some cases, you may still be covered by California wage and broader employment laws, including discrimination.

A key question is, what's your work nexus to California?

If there's little or no connection, you're out of luck. Take Amnoni Myers, a child-welfare consultant and motivational speaker who left Sacramento for Oklahoma two years ago. She said the big draw was $10,000 in cash for eligible remote workers relocating to Tulsa.

Myers, who is Black and queer, knew she would be giving up some social comforts of living in a progressive state, but it turned out there are legal implications as well.

She is considering working for an employer to supplement her consulting work. And although Oklahoma's main employment discrimination law applies broadly to employers, unlike in California and other mostly coastal states, it doesn't include employee protections involving sexual orientation and gender identity and expression.

After two years in Tulsa, Myers said, she's found the city to be more welcoming than she expected. But after learning about the difference, she said, ""That definitely has an impact on where I live. Long term I would have to think through what legal protections are needed for me to be safe to remain in a place long term.""

Most likely it would be a different story if Myers were an employee of a company based in California or reported to a boss or office in California. And such cases are emerging throughout the country.

Frances Schulman, a veterinary pathologist working from her home in New Hampshire after the pandemic, last year filed suit against her former New Jersey-based employer, Zoetis Inc., alleging she was paid much less than male veterinary pathologists with considerably less experience.

Schulman sued under New Jersey's equal pay act, which has fewer employee exclusions and is generally tougher on employers found in violation than a comparable New Hampshire law. Zoetis argued that New Jersey's equal pay law doesn't apply to out-of-state employees, but the court rejected the company's dismissal motion and the case is pending. The critical factor: pay decisions at Zoetis were made by executives in New Jersey.

At the end of the day, what employee benefits and rights remote workers have will depend on the facts of the case and the language of the state law in question. Some laws such as California's paid sick leave specifically states that it applies to employees in California. Others aren't that specific.

Even so, cases such as Schulman's suggest that the surge of remote work may be expanding employment rights for employees as far as venue is concerned.

""Employees could potentially forum shop which state or federal law would be more beneficial,"" said Paul Scrom of the New York employment law firm Halpern & Scrom.

New York and California typically have been at the forefront of advancing worker benefits and protections. And legislators in those states and elsewhere are likely to amend employment laws in the coming years, to make explicit the rights of remote employees.

At the same time, courts are now sorting through an increasing number of these cases as a result of the exponential growth of remote workers from the pandemic.

Surveys show that blue states, which have more pro-worker laws, are more likely to offer remote work. But in expensive California, with its outsize share of tech and other work-from-home jobs, that's added to an already large net outflow of residents to other states.

Many have left for Texas, Nevada, Arizona and other states, often with cheaper housing costs in mind. But, said Scrom, they may want to look into what they may lose by making the move.

""All of these various laws help give you some cushion when you have life events and also give you the work-life balance that you may want,"" he said. ""There's a lot more to consider before you make that call [to move], and not just look at it as, 'Oh, this place is just too expensive to live.'""","{'uri': 'latimes.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'Los Angeles Times'}",[],https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/2a130ec/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5000x2813+0+263/resize/1200x675!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F01%2F77%2F136681e8435d8bfaf38e28573476%2F1365722-na-remote-workers-leaving-california03-bt.jpg,,0.01960784313725483,84,84,Los Angeles Times,latimes.com

Demand increased 1.5% year-over-year, with bankruptcy, labor and employment, litigation and antitrust among practices that helped drive growth, according to the latest edition of the Thomson Reuters Institute's Law Firm Financial Index, which was released on Monday.

The index, which tracks key financial metrics across 170 large and midsized law firms, jumped 6 points in the second quarter of 2023 to the highest score since the first quarter of 2022.

Averaged worked rates - the rate a client has agreed to pay to engage a firm on a legal matter - grew by 5.9% in the second quarter of 2023 compared to the same period the prior year, the report said.

The new figures contrast with Q2 2022, when there was ""dramatic impact"" from a decline in law firm transactional practices, said William Josten, manager for enterprise legal content at the Thomson Reuters Institute, which shares the same parent company as Reuters.

In Q2 2023, ""we're seeing that the counter-cyclical practices have now started to pick up and start to pick up some of the softening"" in the market for transactional work, Josten said.

Demand grew 5.7% for bankruptcy work, 4.6% for antitrust and regulatory work, and 2.4% for labor and employment work in the second quarter. Litigation work climbed 4%, which Josten said could also be a result of courts clearing pandemic-era backlogs.

Demand for corporate practice areas grouped together grew 0.1%, while mergers and acquisitions demand fell 6%. Real estate demand fell 8.4%.

Midsize and large law firms are using different tactics to strengthen profitability, the report said.

Looking to increase revenue, midsize firms grew their associate head count by 0.6% between January and June 2023.

The top 100 law firms, tracked by the American Lawyer and based on revenue, trimmed their associate ranks by 2.5% during that period. Firms that rank between 101-200 grew associate headcount by 0.4%.

A growing number of large U.S. law firms have laid off modest numbers of lawyers and staff as they navigated a downturn in demand late last year and into this year. Two more firms announced cuts this week.

The layoffs indicate ""that firms are trying to find that balance and that right structure of their talent,"" Josten said, noting that the legal industry is not conducting mass layoffs as it did in the 2008 financial crisis.","{'uri': 'reuters.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'Reuters'}","[{'uri': 'sara_merken@reuters.com', 'name': 'Sara Merken', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': False}]",https://www.reuters.com/resizer/CHX3yOvgo2vV3CSQpOnfWBvkgEM=/728x381/smart/filters:quality(80)/cloudfront-us-east-2.images.arcpublishing.com/reuters/3UGYEWDR3ZNG3PT62SF53DYACM.jpg,,0.192156862745098,59,59,Reuters,reuters.com

The Supreme Court said people working for Deliveroo couldn't be considered employees because they don't have specified hours, can work for rival companies, and can appoint someone to work in their place.

The arrangement between Deliveroo and its riders is ""fundamentally inconsistent with any notion of an employment relationship"", its judgment said.

Deliveroo riders had sought collective bargaining rights and the case was brought by the Independent Workers Union of Great Britain (IWGB).

They had tried to negotiate pay and conditions with the company, but were refused in 2017 as the members did not meet the definition of a worker under UK law.

A series of appeals were launched, culminating in the Supreme Court decision, which said they cannot benefit from union membership as they do not meet the definition of a worker or employee.

The IWGB had argued Deliveroo unlawfully interfered with riders' human rights by denying their application to be recognised for collective bargaining purposes.

Workers, under UK employment law, cannot be discriminated against nor have unlawful wage deductions - but don't receive the full range of legal rights conferred on employees.

Just over two years ago, Uber lost its Supreme Court battle and drivers were recognised as workers, not independent third-party contractors, meaning they are entitled to basic employment protections such as the minimum wage.

In the Uber case, judges concluded that drivers are ""in a position of subordination and dependency to Uber, such that they have little or no ability to improve their position through professional or entrepreneurial skills"".

The IWGB said it was disappointed at the Deliveroo ruling and was considering its options.

""Whether reflected in legislation or not, couriers are joining the union in ever bigger numbers and building our collective power to take action and hold companies like Deliveroo to account,"" a statement said.

""Our strength lies not in court rulings but in our unity as a workforce coming together to demand change.""

A Deliveroo spokesperson said: ""UK courts repeatedly and at every level have confirmed that Deliveroo riders are self-employed, and this now includes the Supreme Court, the highest court in the country.

Instead, the plaintiffs alleged they were ""misclassified"" as exempt, independent contractors and ""never received any paystubs, were not paid on regular pay periods, were not given their required meal and rest breaks, were not provided a means to record all their hours, were not paid all their hours, were not reimbursed for employment expenses, were not paid all their overtime wages, and were not paid their wages upon termination of employment.""

Kim was accused of labor law violations

Kim previously denied to Vanity Fair responsibility in the situation. She argued she hired the employees through a third-party company. Moreover, a representative for Kim said she was ""not responsible for how the vendor manages their business and the agreements they have made directly with their staff.""

Andrew Ramirez, one of the plaintiffs in the case, claimed he was fired after 'inquiring about his rights as an employee.' Additionally, his son Andrew Ramirez Jr. alleged he ""was employed as a sixteen-year-old minor, but worked longer than the maximum hours allowed"" legally.

While Kim attempted to have the case dismissed, they agreed to go through a mediation process and ""reached an agreement in principle to resolve this action."" According to the court documents the former employees are expected to request a dismissal of the case within 60 days.

The case is expected to be dismissed within 60 days

Furthermore, all involved ""respectfully request that the Court continue the Status Conference currently scheduled for November 14, 2023, to January 15, 2024, or the first available court date thereafter."" Final settlement information including any monetary payment by Kim is unknown at this time.

The settlement comes about two months after Kim's ex husband Kanye West was also sued over alleged labor law violations. The Mirror previously reported that Tony Saxon filed a complaint against Kanye for unpaid labor, retaliatory termination, and more.

Ella Clark didn't have much time to goof around after she graduated from high school in June. The 18-year-old had to prepare for a federal hearing in San Francisco where she would square off with corporate lawyers representing the biggest coffee chain in the world.

Clark believed Starbucks had violated her rights as she tried to form a union at her store in Northern California during her junior year. So she testified against the company's managers in a National Labor Relations Board trial in July. She says she felt intimidated and even ""slandered"" by the other side. But the judge believed her story and ruled last month that Starbucks illegally retaliated against her when she was a minor.

Clark, now a college freshman at Georgetown University, said she feels vindicated by the judge's decision -- but doubts it will change the company's behavior.

""Starbucks would insist they haven't broken the law,"" said Clark, who hopes to major in government and history. ""But it is getting harder and harder for them to say that, because there are so many rulings like this one, where it is so clear that they have broken the law and continue to.""

""It can be disheartening when Starbucks continues this onslaught,"" she added.

Ever since the union Workers United began organizing Starbucks stores in late 2021, the company has denied it threatened or retaliated against union supporters like Clark. But a growing body of decisions by NLRB judges and board members is undermining the company's public insistence that it has run a clean campaign against the union.

Administrative law judges have ruled that Starbucks broke the law in 34 out of 36 cases that had decisions as of Oct. 18, according to a recent analysis of NLRB trials compiled by the labor board. Judges dismissed some charges within those cases, but found merit in others and ordered Starbucks to ""cease and desist"" its violations.

The charges that were upheld include firing union activists, closing stores where union support was high, withholding raises and benefits from union supporters, and making promises if workers chose not to organize. The officials have told Starbucks to reinstate at least 33 former employees so far, though the cases involving those workers are currently on appeal.

One judge wrote that the violations at stores in New York State were ""egregious and widespread,"" and that Starbucks displayed ""a rich history of antiunion animus"" during the campaign. Another judge wrote that it was only rational for employees to ""assume that they are risking their livelihood by organizing"" given Starbucks' actions.

Starbucks appears to be challenging these rulings as a matter of course, asking the NLRB's board in Washington to review them. (The board typically has five members, but currently only has four: three Democrats and one Republican.) So far, the board has ruled against Starbucks in all four cases in which it has issued decisions.

Where it has exhausted its options before the NLRB, Starbucks has appealed adverse decisions to federal court. In one case, the company has asked the U.S. Supreme Court to weigh in on a federal judge's ruling ordering it to reinstate fired union leaders.

""While appeals of several cases are pending,"" a board spokesperson noted, ""No findings of labor law violations in Starbucks-related cases have been overturned by the Board or Circuit Courts up to this point.""

Asked if Starbucks believes the judges are simply getting all these cases wrong, company spokesperson Andrew Trull noted that the process for litigating unfair labor practice charges ""includes several layers of review"" and ""usually takes years to complete."" He claimed the union was trying to ""weigh down the NLRB with an unprecedented number of alleged charges.""

""Where we believe the charges lack merit or are unfounded, we continue to defend the company and the rights of our partners as matters are fully adjudicated by the NLRB and federal courts,"" Trull said.

He added that the company has worked out settlements with the union and the labor board in cases ""where local managers have failed to comply with our policies or have inadvertently erred in their understanding of proper procedure."" But he said in certain cases the union and the board ""have been unwilling to do so, leaving us no choice but to litigate the matter.""

An NLRB spokesperson said the agency does not compile employer-specific data on unfair labor practices. But Sharon Block, a former board member who is now a professor at Harvard Law School, said she was stunned by the breadth of the decisions against Starbucks.

""I haven't done the kind of deep data dive to say it for sure, but I would bet that there is no other company that has amassed this many violations"" in a similar time period, she said. ""It just paints a picture, when you put it all together, of a company that is absolutely willing to violate the law in order to avoid having to deal with this union.""

Block testified as an expert witness on U.S. labor law at a Senate committee hearing on the Starbucks union campaign in March. Former longtime Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz testified at the same hearing under threat of subpoena and insisted the company had never broken the law.

Although all the Starbucks cases are alive in some fashion on appeal, Block said it should be getting more difficult for the company to maintain that stance with a straight face.

""It's just not credible anymore,"" she said. ""You run out of room to keep arguing that because there are more and more decisions.""

Last month an administrative law judge ruled that Schultz, the company's famous co-founder, personally broke the law by making an ""implied threat"" against a barista during a town hall meeting. The worker had challenged Schultz over the company's ""anti-union"" actions, citing the growing list of unfair labor practice charges against the company. Schultz invited the worker to quit: ""If you're not happy at Starbucks, you can go work for another company.""

The judge noted that Schultz ""had an angry expression on his face.""

But the bulk of cases involve alleged threats and retaliation by non-famous store supervisors and district managers.

Clark was a junior in high school when she read that baristas at a Starbucks in Buffalo, New York, had formed a union. She decided to do the same at her store in Mill Valley, California, just north of San Francisco, where she worked after school and on weekends. She believed the wages needed to be higher because some of her co-workers who were supporting families couldn't afford to live in the area.

She says she felt closely watched after she became a public union supporter. Her manager told her the union effort hurt his feelings, according to hearing testimony. Pro-union postings she put on the bulletin board were removed. A new district manager started hanging around the store. And Clark started to receive write-ups for allegedly unprofessional behavior, culminating in a ""final warning"" that she asked her parents to review because she was just a minor.

""They did appreciate me as a worker, until the union petition,"" Clark said.

The union ended up losing the election by a single vote, 7-6.

The judge ruled that Starbucks broke the law by creating ""the impression of surveillance"" through that district manager, by ordering Clark not to post union literature, by telling Clark not to talk to people about the union, by denying her a promotion because of her union activity, and by finding ""pretextual"" reasons to discipline her. The correspondence around her final warning, the judge wrote, displayed ""a laser focus to pin anything [they] could muster on Clark.""

There are no real financial penalties for such infractions, however. The judge ordered Starbucks to read a notice regarding the unfair labor practices and to pay Clark the extra money she would have earned had she been promoted to barista trainer.

In another recent case, an NLRB judge ruled that Starbucks illegally threatened to withhold abortion travel benefits from workers if they voted in a union.

Ian Hayes, a lawyer who has represented Workers United against Starbucks, said he expects the company to exhaust its appeal options in such cases, even though the penalties are meager and the litigation can be costly. Starbucks has deployed dozens of lawyers from the management-side law firm, Littler Mendelson, throughout the union campaign; four Littler attorneys are listed as having worked on the case involving Clark, according to board records.

""That's what we've seen so far and that's what we've come to expect,"" Hayes said of the appeals. ""You don't have to have a novel argument. You don't have to have a good argument. You don't even have to have a not-laughable argument.""

No matter how many cases an employer loses, it can still succeed by prolonging the litigation and taking some air out of the organizing campaign. Workers United has organized more than 350 of Starbucks' roughly 9,000 corporate-owned U.S. stores, prevailing in around 81% of the elections held. But the pace of unionization has lagged since the rapid organizing of 2022 -- a slowdown many union activists attribute to the company's aggressive response.

Clark quit her job at Starbucks shortly after receiving the final disciplinary warning during the fall of her senior year. A job that had once been a source of escape became the primary source of her stress, she said.

Since arriving at Georgetown in August, Clark has gotten involved in an effort to persuade the university to drop its contract with Starbucks over its ""scorched-earth union-busting campaign,"" as a petition puts it.

Meanwhile, Starbucks has until early December to file a brief challenging the judge's decision in Clark's case. Clark might get a small amount of backpay since the judge found Starbucks withheld her promotion due to her union activity, but the lawyers warned her she might be done with college before the appeals are resolved.

Ministers will today lay a statutory instrument intended to ""enshrine"" key rights and principles derived from the European Union into British law.

It follows questions over whether some employment protections related to things like equal pay and maternity leave would be scrapped from January when The Retained EU Law (Revocation and Reform) Bill comes into effect.

The controversial legislation - also known as the ""Brexit Freedoms Bill"" - will dispense with hundreds of Brussels-derived laws still on British statue books. It will also end the supremacy of EU law over UK law, erasing previous case law principles.

Trade unions and employment lawyers had warned this would create uncertainty over key protections for British workers which derive from the EU and don't exist in British law.

The government said its update today means ""that necessary protections are clearly stated in our domestic legislation"".

One legal expert welcomed the announcement - but said it raised ""legitimate questions"" around what gains had been made from post-Brexit sovereignty if EU laws are simply going to be replicated.

The protections being retained include the ""single-source"" test, which gives women the right to equal pay with men for doing work of equal value, and preventing women from experiencing less favourable treatment at work because they are breastfeeding.

Other laws being retained include:

* Protecting women from unfavourable treatment after they return from maternity leave, where that treatment is in connection with a pregnancy or a pregnancy-related illness occurring before their return;

* Ensuring that women can continue to receive special treatment from their employer in connection with maternity, for example through enhanced occupational maternity schemes;

* Confirming that the definition of disability in the context of employment will explicitly cover working life;

* Holding employers accountable if they create or allow discriminatory recruitment conditions, such as if they make public discriminatory statements about access to employment in their organisation;

* Providing explicit protections from indirect discrimination by association, so that those who may be caught up and disadvantaged by discrimination against others are also protected.

The move could risk angering Eurosceptic Tories, who want to see the UK move away from the EU's influence.

Max Winthrop, the chair of the Law Society's Employment Law Committee, welcomed the clarification that vital rights ""would not be for the legislative dustbin as of December 31st"".

However, he said the move does raise ""legitimate questions"" about the point of Brexit, from a sovereignty standpoint.

""When we are effectively replicating legislation from the EU, and I can understand why the government have done that because it would not be particularly popular to say 'let's scrap maternity rights', it does leave the big question as to what exactly is it that we've gained from leaving the EU,"" he told Sky News.

""We haven't gained what was sometimes referred to as the Singapore-on-the-Thames approach. In other words, to deregulate the marketplace. So you then have to ask yourself the question, is the loss of seamless trade throughout the European Economic Area really worth the cattle?"".

He added that the announcement shows why the original plan to scrap all remaining EU laws by the end of this year ""would have probably been disastrous"".

""It shows the complexity of junking 40 years worth of (EU) legislation, and the sorts of steps we've had to go through to maintain the protections that a lot of people probably thought they already had.""

The Retained EU Law (Revocation and Reform) Bill was originally intended to scrap all EU-era laws which were kept in place after the Brexit transition period in order to minimise disruption to businesses.

But the promised bonfire of Brussels rules and regulations was dramatically scaled-back in May, with less than 600 now set to be junked by the end of this year.

Business Secretary Kemi Badenoch said the change was necessary because of the ""risks of legal uncertainty"" caused by automatically scrapping some 4,000 laws, but there was significant backlash from within the Conservative Party, with arch-Brexiteer Jacob Rees-Mogg accusing the prime minister of ""behaving like a Borgia"".

Notes accidently left on the press release announcing today's measures suggest some concern that retaining the protections could rile up the right wing of the party.

The notes discussed how to answer questions about why the government isn't scrapping the protections, and whether maintaining discrimination laws would threaten free speech and ""make businesses feel they must follow the woke agenda"".

The document stresses that if the EU laws aren't retained, ""employers would in some circumstances be able to make statements, for example, that they wouldn't hire people because they are black. That is not right and not in line with Britain's proud history of equality and fair play"".

""We are only restating laws where there would otherwise be a clear gap in protections: this is an area where we think the law needs to be strong and clear,"" the document says.

Is workers'...,"NEWPORT NEWS, Va. (AP) - A heated debate has emerged about the once-unimaginable shooting of a teacher by her 6-year-old student: How should the school district take care of the teacher?

Should she only get workers´ compensation for her serious physical injuries? Or does she deserve the chance to sue the school system for millions of dollars over claims that it failed to protect her?

Attorneys are likely to argue over those questions Friday in the Virginia city of Newport News, where Abby Zwerner is suing the public schools for $40 million. The former first-grade teacher was hospitalized for nearly two weeks and endured multiple surgeries after a bullet struck her hand and chest.

Zwerner´s lawyers are expected to ask a judge to allow her lawsuit to proceed with allegations of gross negligence against school administrators. The school board will argue for workers´ compensation, which provides up to more than 9 years of pay and a lifetime of medical care for Zwerner's injuries.

She faces an uphill legal battle under Virginia´s uncommonly strict workers´ compensation law, said J. H. Verkerke, a University of Virginia law professor.

Virginia's law covers allegations of negligence against employers as well as workplace-related assaults, Verkerke said. Lawsuits that might move forward in other states often falter in the Commonwealth.

(Billy Schuerman/The Virginian-Pilot via AP, File)

To succeed, Zwerner´s lawyers must prove the shooting was unrelated to her job, even though she was shot in her classroom. Their challenge is ""to somehow make out that it´s personal,"" said Verkerke, who directs UVA´s Program for Employment and Labor Law Studies.

In early January, the 6-year-old pulled out his mother's handgun and shot Zwerner as she sat at a reading table. She rushed her students into the hallway before collapsing in the school´s office.

Zwerner sued in April, alleging school officials ignored multiple warnings that the boy had a gun and was in a violent mood.

Police have said the shooting was intentional. Zwerner claims school officials knew the boy ""had a history of random violence"" at school and home, including when he ""choked"" his kindergarten teacher.

Zwerner´s attorneys say workers' compensation doesn't apply because a first-grade teacher would never anticipate getting shot: ""It was not an actual risk of her job.""

""Her job involved teaching six-year-old children, not exposing herself to criminal assault whenever she went to work,"" Zwerner´s lawyers writes in a brief filed last week.

The school board has failed to prove the shooting was job-related, Zwerner´s attorneys argue. The boy´s ""violence was random and aimed at everyone, both in and out of school.""

He ""asserted that he was angry that people were 'picking on´ his friend, a motivation that had nothing to do with (Zwerner),"" her lawyers write without further elaboration. ""His motivation was a personal one.""

The school board disagrees, writing that the shooting cannot be personal because 6-year-olds lack the capacity to form intent according to Virginia law.

""Children under seven are 'conclusively presumed to be incapable of crime,´"" the school board´s lawyers write in a brief, citing the state's Supreme Court.

The lawyers question how the shooting could be anything but work-related. Zwerner ""was exposed to this alleged negligence only because of her employment at the school,"" they write.

The school board also points out that the boy was suspended for intentionally breaking Zwerner´s cellphone before the shooting. Zwerner´s own lawsuit ""implies that he became angry about that suspension resulting in the shooting,"" school board lawyers write.

""Everything about this incident arises from (Zwerner´s) employment as a teacher,"" the school board argues. ""There is no allegation - nor could any such allegation be credibly made - that (Zwerner) had any personal relationship with (the student).""

Many in Virginia´s legal community will be surprised if Zwerner's lawsuit proceeds, said Verkerke, the UVA law professor. And if it does move forward, the school board will almost certainly appeal given the scope of the state's workers' compensation act.

Workers' compensation laws were deemed a grand bargain in the 20th century between injured workers and employers: Workers lost the ability to sue in most cases, protecting employers from enormous payouts. But people who were injured gained much easier access to compensation - lost pay and medical coverage - without having to prove fault.

""It´s obviously horrifying,"" Verkerke said of the shooting. ""The reality though is that workplace violence is a tragically common occurrence. This is an exceptional case because the assailant is only six years old ... I don´t think I´ve ever seen a case like that.""","{'uri': 'dailymail.co.uk', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'Daily Mail Online'}",[],https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2023/10/25/18/wire-76995399-1698254586-81_636x382.jpg,eng-9004159,-0.07450980392156858,33,33,Daily Mail Online,dailymail.co.uk

Time after time over the past three years, the justices have turned down Trump's pleas for the high court to intervene in his various legal matters. Often, the court has batted down his requests without issuing any opinion, a signal that the legal issues raised were, well, too small to justify the court's attention.

But as Trump's legal problems grow larger, the justices may have little choice to wade in, even if they'd prefer not to deal with polarizing cases involving the former president.

""Are they going to be forced to address those cases? I think the answer is yes,"" said George Washington University law professor Paul Schiff Berman. ""Whether the Supreme Court wants to get involved in issues relating to the election, it's going to be very hard to deny cert in every one of these Trump-related appeals that we expect to see happening.""

Trump hasn't made any formal request yet for the justices to step into any of his criminal prosecutions since he made history last April by becoming the first president or former president to face criminal charges. But on the day after he was arraigned in August on federal charges of attempting to undermine the 2020 election, Trump called publicly for the high court to step in and head off the wave of criminal cases pummeling him.

""It is Election Interference, & the Supreme Court must intercede,"" Trump wrote on his social media site, Truth Social.

He might soon get his wish. A federal judge's gag order on Trump is likely to generate fast-moving emergency appeals. Arguments about whether Trump is immune from prosecution also appear destined for the Supreme Court, because they raise untested and momentous issues about presidential power and accountability. And many legal scholars say the justices must soon resolve a brewing question about whether Trump is an insurrectionist who is disqualified from future office under the Constitution.

How the high court would resolve any of these issues is highly uncertain. The court is, of course, quite conservative, and three of the nine justices are Trump appointees. But as the past three years illustrate, the court has not always looked favorably on Trump's most brazen legal arguments, especially when those arguments seemed more tied to his personal fortunes than the policies he advanced while president.

A taunt, a T-shirt and a First Amendment challenge

Trump isn't even a party to the T-shirt trademark case being argued before the justices Wednesday, although he was still in office when the Patent and Trademark Office turned down a request from California labor lawyer Steve Elster to gain exclusive rights to use the phrase ""Trump Too Small"" on shirts and similar attire.

Solicitor General Elizabeth Prelogar's petition asking the justices to take up the case dances around the double entendre at the core of the dispute, dryly attributing the phrase to ""a memorable exchange between President Trump and Senator Marco Rubio from a 2016 presidential primary debate"" and noting that Elster said he wanted to express the idea ""that some features of President Trump and his policies are diminutive.""

Rubio instigated the exchange by saying on the campaign trail that Trump has ""small hands"" -- a claim that dates to the 1980s, when Spy magazine frequently mocked the real estate mogul as a ""short-fingered vulgarian."" Trump picked up the gauntlet at a debate a few days later, declaring: ""He referred to my hands if they're small, something else must be small. ... I guarantee you there's no problem. I guarantee you.""

Federal law bars the issuance of trademarks that refer to a person without that person's consent, but the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit ruled last year that the law violated the First Amendment by limiting ""speech critical of government officials or public figures.""

Three years of snubs

The T-shirt tussle is a break from what appeared to be an aversion by the justices in recent years to hearing Trump-related cases.

In the wake of the 2020 election, the Supreme Court turned down a series of cases directly challenging the vote, including a Trump-backed bid by the state of Texas to overturn Biden's victory in four battleground states.

The justices also decided not to take up Trump's request to shield his White House records from the House committee probing the events of Jan. 6, 2021, although Justice Clarence Thomas signaled he'd have blocked Congress' access to the files at least temporarily, and Justice Brett Kavanaugh wrote a three-page statement indicating that a former president might be able to invoke executive privilege in other circumstances.

Without any recorded dissent, the Supreme Court also turned down an emergency bid by Trump to put classified documents found by the FBI at his Mar-a-Lago estate back into a court-ordered review process after a federal appeals court carved them out. When the appeals court shut down that process entirely, Trump didn't even bother asking the justices to restore it.

And Trump struck out at the court last year when he attempted to block a House committee from a long quest to obtain his tax returns. Again, no justice came to his aid. About a month later, the House panel made public six years of his tax filings.

Big battles ahead

But many lawyers doubt the high court will manage to completely duck the cloud of legal problems swirling around Trump now, as he tops the field for the Republican presidential nomination and for a rematch with Biden.

Within weeks, the justices could be asked to rule on a raging dispute about a gag order that a federal judge has issued against Trump. The judge is presiding over special counsel Jack Smith's election subversion prosecution against the former president.

Smith's team says the order is necessary to prevent intimidation of witnesses and even potential jurors as a result of Trump's frequently caustic attacks on his perceived enemies, often via social media posts. Trump and his lawyers say it's an unconstitutional infringement on his free speech rights in the heat of a political campaign.

Trump has appealed the gag order to the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals, but if it doesn't lift the directive, he's likely to ask the justices to do so.

Trump also is seeking to dismiss the federal election subversion case altogether, on grounds that he is entitled to ""absolute immunity"" for acts taken as president. If the judge rebuffs that request, Trump's lawyers are expected to take that up on appeal and possibly to the Supreme Court.

Similar fights over the immunity issue are looming in the three other criminal cases against him: a federal prosecution in Florida for allegedly retaining classified documents at his Mar-a-Lago estate, a state prosecution in Georgia for alleged attempts to tamper with the presidential election results there and a state prosecution in New York over his handling of payments to porn star Stormy Daniels prior to the 2016 election.

But the biggest 2024-election-related legal fight that the justices are likely to confront in the coming months is an ongoing series of battles aimed at throwing Trump off primary and, potentially, general election ballots in various states.

These legal efforts, relying on a provision of the 14th Amendment, argue that Trump supported an insurrection on Jan. 6, 2021, and therefore is disqualified from holding office again.

The efforts are gathering momentum this week. On Monday, a trial got underway in a state court in Denver on a lawsuit brought by Republican voters aimed at knocking him off the ballot there. On Thursday, the Minnesota Supreme Court is scheduled to hear arguments on a similar attempt in that state. Legal challenges claiming Trump is ineligible to run as a result of his actions after the 2020 election are pending in at least 20 states.

While some legal experts have been pushing for the Supreme Court to resolve the issue quickly, others say it's already basically too late to do so in an orderly way, with the first primaries and caucuses set for mid-January.

""There's no time,"" said Boston University law professor Jed Shugerman. ""It puts the court in an impossible position. ... It is impossible for them to reach a decision before the primary process is over on both sides.""

However, Trump allies say that if he is struck from the ballot anywhere in the country, the justices must drop their past reluctance to take up Trump-related cases.

""They must take this case because these are republic-ending tactics,"" former Senate Judiciary Committee GOP counsel Mike Davis said Monday on a podcast hosted by GOP activist Roger Stone.

Davis said the court has acted in ""weaselly ways"" in the past to avoid legal issues raised by Trump but will have to grapple with any attempt to knock him off the ballot in part because his supporters will view such a move as just what some accuse Trump of: an outrageous attack on democracy.

Said Davis: ""These Supreme Court justices will have to put on their big boy pants.""","{'uri': 'politico.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'POLITICO'}",[],https://www.politico.com/dims4/default/b1b41d5/2147483647/legacy_thumbnail/1200x800%3E/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.politico.com%2F99%2F32%2F494c020d4a388280ab5dadcad7b4%2Fhttps-delivery-gettyimages.com%2Fdownloads%2F1763740330,eng-9018094,0.05098039215686279,31,31,POLITICO,politico.com

Chris McMann joined the Sheriff's Office as a recruit in 2017. McMann was working in the jail in November 2020, when he found out two of his daughters had allegedly been ""molested by their uncle, Sgt. Kevin Estep,"" the lawsuit alleges.

McMann's attorney, Denise Eaton-May, did not respond to a request for an interview, but the complaint says McMann obtained inappropriate text messages from Estep, including one in which the sergeant told a minor to ""let me see your ass.""

McMann then reported the suspected crime to the Brentwood Police Department, where investigators allegedly documented a ""pre-text"" call in which Estep made incriminating statements.

McMann's lawsuit alleges that the Contra Costa County District Attorney's Office declined to prosecute Estep because of the ""potential impact this type of trial would have on the minors,"" but District Attorney's Office spokesman Ted Asregadoo wrote in an email Thursday that prosecutors didn't move forward in 2021 because, ""there was insufficient evidence to prove beyond reasonable doubt the charge against Kevin Estep.""

McMann also allegedly reported Estep to internal affairs, hoping their investigation might review the text messages and the police report from Brentwood. Instead, the lawsuit says the Sheriff's Office withdrew the complaint on his behalf -- without his consent -- and refused to take any further action on the allegations against Estep.

The plaintiff argues they were ""neglecting and summarily dismissing his grievance.""

After that, McMann alleges he faced multiple forms of retaliation. At one point, he was called in for a meeting with Division Cmdr. Jack Ray Tucker and presented with a false report fabricated by Lt. Andrew John Leca accusing McMann of unnecessary use of force, according to the civil complaint.

McMann was reportedly forced to work alone in a part of the jail populated by suspected sex offenders, despite a policy requiring a partner for such assignments. McMann also lost overtime hours, which impacted him financially, and was eventually reassigned to a unit in the coroner's bureau, according to the plaintiff.

""After contemplating leaving the department due to the disparate treatment he was receiving, Mr. McMann was told that Undersheriff [Richard] Lucia indicated that he was glad Mr. McMann was leaving the department because his 'career is shot,' implying that his career within the agency was over because of his complaint of sexual misconduct that he filed against Sgt. Estep,"" the lawsuit alleges.

Public records from Transparent California -- a website that tracks public employee salary data -- indicate Estep, Leca and McMann all left the Sheriff's Office at some point in 2021. These records also show that in 2021 and 2022, Estep held a part-time job with the Administration of Justice program for the Chabot-Las Positas Community College District.

McMann is suing the Alameda County Sheriff's Office for retaliating against him in violation of state labor law as well as failure to perform a mandatory duty by investigating his allegations against Estep. He's asking for financial damages, attorney fees and court costs.

Alameda County sheriff's spokesperson Lt. Tya Modeste declined to comment on the case, saying she is unable to discuss pending litigation with the media. Alameda County Counsel Donna Ziegler did not respond to a request for comment.","{'uri': 'cbsnews.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'CBS News'}",[],https://assets1.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2022/09/19/c4f9ddf7-1007-4c9a-9c60-55f99be6f2c3/thumbnail/1200x630/54c063f9a2611ea921c901101c9be90e/alco-sheriff-logo.jpg?v=5799c2de91a486f8a37c0b0f0daf468a,,-0.3411764705882353,26,26,CBS News,cbsnews.com

Six Republican and unaffiliated Colorado voters filed the lawsuit in early September with the backing of a liberal watchdog group called Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, or CREW. They're arguing that Trump is disqualified from serving as president again because of his role in the January 6, 2021, insurrection.

The challengers have scored a series of pretrial victories, defying expectations by defeating several motions by Trump and the Colorado GOP to throw out the case.

The bench trial in Colorado District Court is scheduled to last at least one week. Trump is not expected to attend. He denies wrongdoing regarding January 6, and his campaign said the challengers are ""stretching the law beyond recognition.""

""It's the first domino to fall. We've never seen a challenge like this to a presidential candidate, hearings that go for days to evaluate their eligibility,"" said Derek Muller, an election law expert at Notre Dame Law School who filed a brief in a similar case that was neutral on disqualifying Trump but gave analysis for key legal questions.

""It's not a frivolous lawsuit, but it's not a slam dunk,"" Muller added.

What does the 14th Amendment say?

The 14th Amendment, which was ratified after the Civil War, says US officials who take an oath to uphold the Constitution are disqualified from holding future office if they ""engaged in insurrection"" or have ""given aid or comfort"" to insurrectionists.

However, the Constitution does not spell out how to enforce the ban, and it has been applied only twice since the 1800s, when it was used against former Confederates.

The amendment's key provision, Section 3, says in part: ""No person shall ... hold any office ... under the United States ... who, having previously taken an oath ... to support the Constitution of the United States, shall have engaged in insurrection or rebellion against the same, or given aid or comfort to the enemies thereof.""

What is the trial about?

The challengers sued Colorado Secretary of State Jena Griswold. They want a court order blocking Griswold from putting Trump's name on Colorado's GOP primary ballot and the general election ballot. Griswold, a Democrat, hasn't taken a position on whether Trump is disqualified and said she'll do what the judge orders her to do.

Colorado Judge Sarah Wallace had spelled out some of the key questions for trial.

* What is the definition of ""engaged"" and ""insurrection""?

* Did Trump engage in an insurrection?

* Is the so-called insurrectionist ban self-executing, or does Congress need to take action before a candidate is disqualified?

* Does Griswold have the power under Colorado law to exclude a candidate from the ballot based on federal constitutional considerations?

* Does the ban apply to US presidents, or only to other officials?

How is Trump fighting back?

Trump has ridiculed the lawsuit at his campaign rallies. His lawyers and advisers have argued that it would be ""un-American"" to deprive voters the opportunity to decide whether the former president should return to the White House by removing him from the ballot.

In his attempts to throw out the lawsuit, Trump unsuccessfully argued that the case misinterpreted Colorado's ballot access laws, that the lawsuit raised a ""political question"" that only Congress could decide and that it violated his free-speech rights.

""This is a political lawsuit meant to prevent President Trump from standing for election and to block Colorado voters from having the opportunity to vote for him,"" Trump's lawyers wrote in a court filing last week.

They added, ""Colorado statute provides no basis for barring a presidential candidate under the Fourteenth Amendment. And President Trump never advocated for or incited violence on January 6, 2021.""

Why is this happening now?

CREW filed the lawsuit in September, asking for an expedited process to resolve the dispute before Colorado's GOP primary on March 5, which is Super Tuesday.

Wallace has said she hopes to issue a ruling by Thanksgiving, so appeals courts in Colorado have enough time to review the matter and hand down their own decision.

Griswold has said there is a ""hard deadline"" of January 5 for a resolution in the case. Her office is required by that date to certify the names of all candidates that will be printed on the March 5 primary ballot.

What's the big picture?

This is one of several lawsuits in battleground states to remove Trump from the ballot. Other advocacy groups have filed challenges in Minnesota and Michigan.

While the groups behind the lawsuits are liberal-leaning, many of the plaintiffs are Republicans. The lead plaintiff in Colorado is Norma Anderson, a Republican former state legislator who served as majority leader in the both the Colorado House and Senate.

A growing number of constitutional scholars have endorsed the challengers' theory against Trump, including some notable conservative jurists and legal experts.

But serious divides remain how the 14th Amendment could be applied to Trump and how the ban would even be implemented, whether by election officials, Congress or a court, given the constitutional ambiguities. Many expect the Supreme Court - with its conservative supermajority - will ultimately weigh in on the matter.

Has this happened before?

There hasn't been a case like this in history, though no US president has ever tried to overturn an election, like Trump did. It would be unprecedented to apply the 14th Amendment ""insurrectionist ban"" to any presidential candidate, let alone the clear front-runner for a major party nomination, as Trump is leading in the GOP polls.

The ban has been applied only once in the modern era - and CREW was behind that successful effort.

A convicted January 6 rioter who was also a New Mexico county commissioner was removed from office last year on 14th Amendment grounds through a different but related legal mechanism, after CREW filed a lawsuit.

In that case, the official had already been convicted of a January 6-related offense. Trump is facing state and federal charges related to the Capitol riot and his attempts to overturn the 2020 election - but he pleaded not guilty and hasn't gone to trial yet.

Wallace was appointed to the bench last year by Colorado Gov. Jared Polis, a Democrat. He said Wallace would fill a vacancy opening in January of this year.

Previously, she was a partner at the large law firm Ballard Spahr, where she specialized in commercial litigation, breach-of-contract matters and employment law.

But with billions of dollars hanging in the balance, a judge just threw a curveball to one of those jockeying for position.

Developers who want to turn the Nassau Coliseum site into a gambling casino and resort were told to go back to the drawing board.

The two sides squared off prior to Nassau County's sudden vote in May that approved construction of a $4 billion casino complex at the Nassau Coliseum site.

But in what some are calling a bombshell, that lease agreement was blocked by a state supreme court judge, for now at least.

""We are very encouraged by the judge's decision,"" said Pearl Jacobs of Uniondale, a civic association leader. ""Rules of open meetings and transparency were clearly violated.""

The decision is a big victory for Hofstra University, a stone's throw from the Hub. The university argued a gambling casino could have a harmful effect on the campus.

""We appreciate the court's thoughtful ruling. We look forward to the planning process advocating for the best use of the Hub,"" Hofstra President Susan Poser said in a statement.

The judge ruled officials short-circuited the open meetings and environmental laws before voting in an attempt to avoid public scrutiny.

""A project of this size needs a pretty extensive environmental impact analysis. Utilities in the area, impact on traffic, impact on economics,"" said Michael Shenoda, an associate professor at Farmingdale State College.

George and Lynn Krug of Garden City said persistent opposition to the casino project paid off.

""The people who don't want it thought that it was already a done deal,"" said George Krug.

""It was rushed through by the legislature, and as a grass routes group, I really got involved,"" said Lynn Krug.

They say develop the Hub, but without a casino.

Meanwhile, Sands hopes the decision is just a bump in the road.

""Las Vegas Sands is proceeding proudly and enthusiastically with our proposal for an integrated resort and entertainment center at the Nassau Hub,"" the company said.

It's unclear if or when Sands, Nassau's planning commission and legislature would begin a new comprehensive review and transparent public hearings.","{'uri': 'cbsnews.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'CBS News'}",[],https://assets3.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2023/11/10/7660c36e-a4aa-41f4-82e8-53b74b7f3714/thumbnail/1200x630/3ad478a2a56d1a13913e5a298e70e3fc/new-new-mclogan-5p-pkg-wcbs8f7f-hi-res-still.jpg?v=8afad5e29ac9a704fff9d98ba34d3649,eng-9052371,0.2313725490196079,51,51,CBS News,cbsnews.com

The Senate is set to vote this week on an amendment introduced late last month by Sens. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, the ranking member of the Commerce Committee, and Cynthia Lummis, R-Wyo., which would defund Ann Carlson, who is serving as acting administrator of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), a Transportation Department subagency.

Carlson continues to lead NHTSA despite failing to clear the Senate confirmation process for the position earlier this year. The White House ultimately pulled her name for NHTSA administrator in May after Cruz led opposition to her nomination in response to ethics concerns related to her environmental activism and involvement in recruiting donors for a law firm leading high-profile climate litigation against oil companies.

""President Biden's illegal appointment of Ann Carlson, who was effectively rejected by the Senate due to concerns about her extreme agenda and radical record, will only yield more mandates, higher costs for families and a less vibrant economy,"" Cruz told Fox News Digital last month.

Cruz also penned a letter to President Biden, noting that the Federal Vacancies Reform Act prohibits ""any person who has been nominated to fill any vacant office from performing that office's duties in an acting capacity."" He argued that the provision and the fact that Carlson did not serve in the position of first assistant to former NHTSA Administrator Steven Cliff for more than 90 days before he resigned last year precludes her from her current position.

On Sunday, Republican Commerce Committee staff circulated a memo first obtained by Fox News Digital which highlighted the panel's findings from an investigation they opened into Carlson.

REPUBLICANS RAISE ALARM ON FAILED BIDEN NOMINEE WHO CONTINUES CRAFTING REGS TARGETING GAS-POWERED CARS

According to the memo, while she was an environmental law professor at UCLA, Carlson was actively involved in and helped coordinate California law firm Sher Edling's efforts to pursue novel litigation against fossil fuel companies. In recent years, Sher Edling has filed more than a dozen so-called climate nuisance lawsuits on behalf of cities, counties and several states, arguing the oil industry has been aware of climate change impacts for decades.

Fox News Digital previously reported that Carlson worked with Dan Emmett, the chairman of the Emmett Institute on Climate Change & the Environment to raise money from liberal non-profit organizations to fund Sher Edling's work through an indirect dark money fund. The pair secured support from Terry Tamminen in his role as the Leonardo DiCaprio Foundation's CEO at the time.

According to tax filings, between 2017 and 2020, the secretive Collective Action Fund for Accountability, Resilience, and Adaptation (CAF) wired more than $5.2 million to Sher Edling. Then, in 2021 alone, CAF funneled another $3 million to the firm.

Carlson also reported in financial disclosures that she also provided pro bono consulting for Sher Edling on its litigation against oil companies.

LEONARDO DICAPRIO TRAVELED ON GAS-GUZZLING PRIVATE JETS, YACHTS WHILE FUNDING CLIMATE NUISANCE LAWSUITS

The Senate GOP memo Sunday further concluded that unpaid UCLA Law School students from Carlson's institute assisted Sher Edling by providing free legal services and that Carlson has ""repeatedly concealed her work"" with Sher Edling. The memo stated Sher Edling is similarly hiding the nature of Carlson's work for the firm ""despite repeated attempts from Congress to obtain information.""

""After reasonable investigation, it appears that Ms. Carlson's consultations for Sher Edling ended by 2020 (when, as I understand it, she departed the University of California, Los Angeles School of Law for the U.S. Department of Transportation),"" counsel for Sher Edling wrote in a letter obtained by Fox News Digital and sent to Cruz and House Oversight Committee Chairman James Comer, R-Ky., on Oct. 6.

""As to the nature of the consultations, it does not appear, after reasonable investigation, that Ms. Carlson consulted with Sher Edling on the merits of any specific climate damage and deception case; rather, her consultations were limited to the general legal issues implicated by those cases,"" the letter continued.

The firm declined to provide further details about what Carlson's work entailed, when she provided services to Sher Edling, or any benefits she received. It also declined to reveal in the letter how much funding it has received from non-profit entities and where the entirety of its funding stream has originated from.

Meanwhile, in her role as acting NHTSA administrator, Carlson helped craft the agency's most-aggressive-ever fuel economy standards that experts warned would substantially increase car prices and force electric vehicle purchases, but which she argued would ""reduce harmful emissions."" She unveiled the regulations in July, two months after the White House withdrew her nomination.

""These revelations make it clear that Ann Carlson is utterly unsuited for a job in government,"" Tom Jones, the president of right-leaning watchdog group American Accountability Foundation, told Fox News Digital. ""Putting a Leftist swamp creature like her in charge of regulating vehicles in America, even after she was rejected by the Senate, is a serious scandal that Joe Biden needs to answer for. Carlson has spent her career making life harder for regular Americans with her arbitrary and delusional campaign to eradicate gasoline powered cars.""

""As we've just seen, even electric vehicles' biggest boosters at Ford have realized that this technology is not a realistic alternative to gasoline cars,"" Jones added. ""But thanks to Joe Biden she has the power to impose her extremist green ideology on all of us, attempting to become a Soviet style central planner for American cars.""

When University of Pennsylvania President Liz Magill was tapped for the post just 18 months ago, she was heralded as the ""clear consensus"" to lead the Ivy League university.

Today that consensus is nowhere to be found. In trying to placate everyone on the contentious issues of antisemitism, Palestinian rights, free speech and academic freedom, she has angered high-profile and deep-pocketed donors and trustees, many of whom resigned and pulled their funding in recent days.

It's quite a change in standing for the woman with the gold-plated resume who was tapped last year to be the 27th leader of the nearly 300-year old school once led by Benjamin Franklin. (Despite its name, the university is a private institution, not a state school.)

She came to UPenn after serving as the provost, the number two administrative post, at the University of Virginia, where she had previously attended law school. She joined the law school faculty there immediately after serving as a clerk to Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg. Before her time as Provost at UVa, she served as Dean of Stanford Law.

But now a former UPenn trustee is calling on her to resign; some donors are announcing they have closed their checkbooks because of the decision to allow speakers that Penn's administration acknowledged had a history of making antisemitic remarks to participate in the Palestine Writes Literature Festival on campus last month.

Criticism of that event, and the university's response, has surged since the Hamas attack on Israel sparked the war there earlier this month. Some donors are also calling for her resignation. She's also under attack from those on campus who feel she's not doing enough to protect academic freedom in the face of attacks on the festival.

Magill did not respond to CNN's request to the University for an interview.

A family of lawyers

Born in Fargo, North Dakota, Magill comes from a family of lawyers, with her father serving as a Federal Court of Appeals judge appointed by President Ronald Reagan. Her brother is a state court judge in Minnesota. And her husband is an environmental lawyer.

She told the Daily Pennsylvanian, the school paper, that she had not planned to pursue any kind of legal career. She was a history major as an undergraduate at Yale University, and she planned to pursue a PhD in history and then a career in teaching after graduation.

But when she finished college she instead worked as a legislative assistant to Kent Conrad, the Democratic US senator from her home state of North Dakota. Her work with Conrad centered around energy policy and regulation research, and that led her to an interest in government and regulatory law and, eventually, to UPenn.

Now it's not clear that Magill will be able to survive the controversy.

Vahan Gureghian, a former member of the board of trustees who voted to appoint Magill, resigned from the board late last week in protest to the handling of the Palestine Writes festival. He is saying the decision to pick her was a mistake.

""She is negligent and not really up to the job of being the president of one of the eight or so most elite universities in the world,"" Gureghian, a charter-school magnate, told CNN in a phone interview on Wednesday.

And major donors are voicing objections as well, and speaking with their dollars. Mark Rowan, CEO of private equity giant Apollo Global Management, is among those calling for the ouster of both Magill and Board of Trustees chairman Scott Bok over the Palestine Writes festival.

On September 12, ahead of the Palestine Writes festival and weeks before the outbreak of war in Israel and Gaza, Magill and other top university administrators issued a statement acknowledging the accusations of antisemitism being made against some of the speakers at the event.

""We unequivocally - and emphatically - condemn antisemitism as antithetical to our institutional values,"" said the statement. But it added that ""as a university, we also fiercely support the free exchange of ideas as central to our educational mission. This includes the expression of views that are controversial and even those that are incompatible with our institutional values.""

That not only angered critics of the event, but also those who felt it undercut the principals and practice of free speech and academic freedom on campus. A letter signed by 36 members of faculty at the school criticized that statement.

""It is equally important for us as educators to declare our support for Palestinian artists and writers, making it clear that we condemn antisemitism as well as Islamophobia and the oppression of Palestinians,"" said the letter sent from the faculty members before the festival was held.

Request to 'Amend your statement'

""We ask that as leaders of the Penn community, you immediately amend your statement so that it is clearly in support of a diversity of views and diversity of religious, racial, and cultural communities on campus.""

On Wednesday Magill issued a new statement to try to bring the two sides together.

""Hateful speech has no place at Penn. No place. I categorically condemn hateful speech that denigrates others as contrary to our values,"" Magill said. ""In this tragic moment, we must respect the pain of our classmates and colleagues and recognize that our speech and actions have the power to both harm and heal our community. We must choose healing, resisting those who would divide us and instead respect and care for one another.""

Magill got a vote of support from one major donor, Jon Gray, president of asset manager Blackstone, who told Bloomberg Thursday he would continue to make donations to UPenn in support of low-income students and cancer research , despite his concerns about antisemitism.

""Some of my colleagues in the financial field and more broadly have raised some really legitimate concerns about hate speech masquerading as free speech in the context of antisemitism on college campuses at Penn and other places,"" Gray said in an interview on Bloomberg Television. As for Magill, he said, """"I think she's a good person. I don't think she's antisemitic.""

So far Magill has the support of the school's board of trustees.

""The unanimous sense of those gathered was that President Magill and her existing University leadership team are the right group to take the University forward,"" said board Chairman Bok.

But It's not clear if Magill, or Bok, will remain, given the clout of donors who are unhappy with the handling of the controversy so far.

Jr. Has Turned His Public Crusades Into a Private Windfall,"Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has said he is driven by his family's legacy of public service and good works.Credit...Sophie Park for The New York Times

In 2021, Robert F. Kennedy Jr. earned more than $500,000 as the chairman and top lawyer at Children's Health Defense, the nonprofit organization that he has helped build into a leading spreader of anti-vaccine falsehoods and a platform for launching his independent bid for the White House.

The compensation was almost three times as high as the amount paid to the organization's president, but it was not Mr. Kennedy's biggest source of income. Neither was his family's fabled wealth. Instead, most of his earnings around the same time came from law firms -- a total of $7 million for lending them his name, connections and expertise to sue major companies.

Throughout his long public life, Mr. Kennedy has cultivated an image as a man committed to a greater good, the blessing and burden of belonging to one of America's most storied political families. Whether cleaning up rivers as an environmentalist or railing against the purported dangers of inoculations, he has said he is driven by his family's legacy of civic duty and sacrifice.

He built his presidential run around similar themes, even as his cousin dismissed the campaign as a ""vanity project"" and other relatives disavowed his beliefs. On the trail, Mr. Kennedy has delivered a populist message of anti-corporate rhetoric and debunked science while invoking a powerful lineage: his uncles, former President John F. Kennedy and Senator Ted Kennedy, and his father, Senator Robert F. Kennedy.

""RFK Jr. began a career of public services as soon as he passed the NY State Bar,"" reads one of the top lines on his campaign website.

In a 2018 book, he credited his mother, Ethel, for instilling important values. ""She tried to give us the sense that we mustn't be satisfied with 'making a big pile for ourselves and whoever dies with the most stuff wins,'"" Mr. Kennedy wrote. ""Our lives, she taught us, should serve a higher purpose.""

But an examination of Mr. Kennedy's finances by The New York Times, including public filings and almost two dozen interviews as well as tax returns and other documents not previously made public, showed that while he appears to believe in the causes he champions, they have also had a practical benefit: His crusades, backed by the power of his name, have earned him tens of millions of dollars.

Mr. Kennedy inherited many things from his family -- a charismatic presence, a gift for public speaking, a place among the nation's elite -- but not necessarily the kind of money that would support a life of both altruism and the trappings of wealth he seems to enjoy, The Times found. His grandfather, Joseph P. Kennedy, poured a fortune into trust funds for his descendants, helping to support the political ambitions of his sons. But Mr. Kennedy came into a relatively modest portion.

Behind much of his public career has been a relentless private hustle: board positions and advisory gigs, side deals with law firms, book contracts and an exhausting schedule of paid speeches, once upward of 60 a year by his own count.

While most people have to work, Mr. Kennedy did not always settle for the six-figure salary he was earning in positions with nonprofits. For decades, he has entwined his loftier missions with opportunities for enrichment. In addition to his salary at Children's Health Defense, for instance, he stands to profit personally from lawsuits, including against the pharmaceutical giant Merck over a common vaccine for children.

When Mr. Kennedy was still best known as an environmentalist, he met Alan Salzman, an investor in clean technology companies, and was intrigued: Mr. Kennedy wanted to find alternatives to carbon-based energy, ""which I think is the biggest enemy to American democracy and the environment,"" he said in a 2012 deposition reviewed by The Times.

""And I also saw it as an opportunity to make some money for my family,"" he continued.

Mr. Kennedy would earn millions of dollars over at least eight years from work connected to Mr. Salzman's venture capital firm, VantagePoint, including promoting a project that other environmentalists opposed.

In an interview, Mr. Kennedy said that he was proud of giving his family a good life while promoting his causes.

""I have been able to use the various gifts I've been given -- education, the contacts and the value of a name that a generation in my family put a lot of effort into enhancing and retaining its value,"" he said. ""I'm grateful that I've been given those gifts and that I am able to do well by doing good.""

His campaign said in a statement that he had ""never put a need or desire to make money ahead of his values and moral compass.""

Recently, Mr. Kennedy's presidential bid has gained some traction. In a poll conducted last month by The Times and Siena College, 24 percent of voters in battleground states said they would support Mr. Kennedy in a theoretical matchup between him, President Biden and former President Donald J. Trump, the leading Republican candidate.

In the campaign, Mr. Kennedy has cast himself as an heir to his family's mystique. Yet what has at times looked from the outside like the glamorous life of a dynastic prince has occasionally been underwritten by others.

Wealthy friends were behind the purchase of the home Mr. Kennedy used on the family compound on Cape Cod, records show. He had an arrangement with a major environmental nonprofit group to pay for his children to accompany him on work trips, and he accepted a free Lexus as part of a promotional event for green vehicles.

""The Kennedys' wealth is inextricably intertwined with people's impression of the Kennedys -- and that isn't a surprise when you think their grandfather amassed one of America's biggest fortunes when his kids were young,"" said Fredrik Logevall, a historian at Harvard who is writing a two-volume biography of John F. Kennedy.

""But two generations later,"" Professor Logevall said, ""some family members have more of the money than others.""

A Grandfather's Wealth

Joseph Kennedy's estate, widely believed to be valued at roughly $500 million when he died in 1969 (about $4.2 billion in today's dollars), was left largely in trusts for his descendants.

Robert Kennedy had been assassinated the previous year while running for the Democratic nomination for president. He left half his estate to Ethel and divided the remainder equally among his children, according to documents filed in Manhattan Surrogate Court. But after an expensive campaign, he died with heavy debt, and more than half of his estate went to pay it off.

While the court documents put the senator's total estate at $1.6 million, there was more, shrouded in trusts whose value is not public. Still, disclosure forms Mr. Kennedy filed with the Federal Election Commission as part of his bid for the presidency, as well as other documents, provide some insight into his portion of the family wealth.

Mr. Kennedy owns between $4 million and $15 million in inherited assets, held in trusts -- the biggest, a stake in Wolf Point, a Chicago real estate development built on land his grandfather bought decades ago. Over the years, Mr. Kennedy has enjoyed large one-time distributions from his trust funds when assets were sold, according to bank records and public documents.

But the trusts do not tend to generate much steady income: He received between roughly $29,000 and $90,500 over a recent 18-month period, according to the F.E.C. filing. While certainly a boon, it is far from enough to finance Mr. Kennedy's lifestyle: At one point, a little over a decade ago, he estimated that his annual household expenses were $1.4 million.

""I have never gotten a lot of money from my family,"" Mr. Kennedy told The Times.

He said his biggest expense in recent years was his children's education. He drives, he said, a 1998 minivan. But he also lives with his wife, the actress Cheryl Hines, in a $6 million home in Brentwood, an affluent Los Angeles neighborhood.

Mr. Kennedy said that one reason his branch of the family never enjoyed the clan's presumed riches, in addition to his father's debt, is that he was one of 11 children, leaving him with less inherited money than other members of his generation. (When his cousin John F. Kennedy Jr. died in 1999, he left a $250,000 bequest to Mr. Kennedy.)

In the 2012 deposition, which Mr. Kennedy gave during his bitter divorce from his second wife, Mary Richardson Kennedy, he said Ethel Kennedy was ""broke,"" and family members secretly helped cover her living expenses.

""Those of us who stay at her house pay her, and she doesn't know she's being paid,"" he said.

In the interview with The Times, Mr. Kennedy said that his mother, now 95, is no longer struggling financially.

A High-Flying Life

By the year 2000, after a bumpy early adulthood that included an arrest for heroin possession, Mr. Kennedy was a nationally recognized environmental lawyer. The previous year, he had been named a hero of the planet by Time magazine for his work with the Riverkeeper organization, among the groups credited with cleaning up New York's polluted Hudson River.

As a lawyer, he was on the payrolls of both the environmental litigation clinic at Pace University's law school and the Natural Resources Defense Council, where his salary was subsidized by Riverkeeper, according to a person familiar with the arrangement.

That year, Mr. Kennedy saw an opportunity that would eventually net him millions of dollars.

He co-founded a law firm, Kennedy & Madonna, with Kevin Madonna, a Pace Law graduate who had worked at the clinic. The firm allowed Mr. Kennedy to target polluters while profiting at a scale far beyond his nonprofit salaries. Kennedy & Madonna teamed up with other firms on class-action lawsuits against major corporations, including Dupont and the Southern California Gas Company, and took a cut of any proceeds.

Although Mr. Kennedy was listed first in the firm's name, he said in his 2012 divorce case that his partner dealt with most of the detailed legal work. Mr. Kennedy typically handled depositions and court appearances -- moments when his famous name and presence would have the strongest effect. Mr. Madonna declined to comment.

In 2002, Mr. Kennedy also forged a relationship with a personal-injury law firm in Pensacola, Fla. He was paid to do a radio show with one of the firm's partners, and was listed as ""of counsel"" at the firm, which did some class-action environmental litigation.

It was adding up to a good living, by most standards. By 2008, his jobs at the Florida firm and the nonprofits were bringing in about $400,000 a year. His trust funds and investments connected to his grandfather generated at least $150,000, according to his tax return.

Income from Kennedy & Madonna could be bumpy. For instance, from 2008 through 2010, the firm produced virtually no income, tax records show. But in 2011 Mr. Kennedy received $700,000, part of the firm's share of a legal settlement with Ford Motor.

Still, Mr. Kennedy was leading an expensive life between his home in Bedford, N.Y., a wealthy enclave north of Manhattan, where he lived with his wife and children, and the home he was using on Cape Cod. He bought the Bedford house in the 1980s, with financing from the sale of a luxury Manhattan apartment that a close family friend had willed to him, records show.

In 2010, Mr. Kennedy's household expenses reached $1.4 million. The mortgage and a home-equity loan on the Bedford property cost about $191,000. Memberships to a yacht club and other organizations ran him more than $14,000, while nannies and housekeepers cost more than $70,000. Pool maintenance was upward of $12,000. On top of those expenses, his assistant earned roughly $200,000.

His use of the home at the Kennedy compound in Hyannis Port, Mass., was made possible by wealthy friends, The Times found. It had been purchased by a lawyer with ties to Wendy Abrams, a Chicago-based philanthropist who has donated millions of dollars to environmental causes, including some of Mr. Kennedy's, records show.

In the interview, Mr. Kennedy said Ms. Abrams and her husband, whom he described as his closest friends, stepped in because he did not have enough money to buy the home when it came up for sale.

The house, a six-bedroom with traditional gray shingles, was bought in 2008 for $2.5 million. For years, Mr. Kennedy paid $4,000 a month in rent. The lease, which was reviewed by The Times, shows that he had an option to buy the home for the original purchase price, which he did in 2020.

The Abramses, Mr. Kennedy said in the deposition, had also footed the bill for a vacation to Jamaica for him; his then-girlfriend, Ms. Hines; and their respective children, while the Natural Resources Defense Council sometimes paid for his children to travel with him.

""All my vacations are paid for. So I just, I try not to spend money,"" Mr. Kennedy said in the deposition.

Ms. Abrams told The Times she commonly hosted friends in rented vacation homes. Mr. Kennedy said in his interview with The Times that his work for the N.R.D.C. could involve spending weeks in other countries, and the nonprofit agreed to pay for his children to travel to see him. The N.R.D.C. declined to comment.

Mr. Kennedy also accepted a free Lexus from Toyota, The Times found. He said he received the car when he helped the automaker promote charging stations for electric vehicles in California.

A Shadow Career

In addition to his jobs with nonprofits and his law firms, Mr. Kennedy turned to paid speeches as a big source of income. He said he could charge as much as $250,000 for a talk overseas, and at least $25,000 for others.

By the time he entered into divorce proceedings with Ms. Richardson Kennedy, he was on the road at a frenetic pace, at one point giving more than 60 speeches a year. (Ms. Richardson Kennedy died by suicide in 2012, before the divorce was final.)

If he wasn't around enough to put in a traditional workweek at any one organization, his name and natural charisma certainly raised their profiles and drew celebrities and deep-pocketed benefactors to their events, including the actors Pierce Brosnan, Alec Baldwin and Ms. Hines.

At the same time, Mr. Kennedy's high-profile environmental work opened the door to a lucrative shadow career as a corporate director and consultant. His reputation, experience and wide network of contacts had value: He could make introductions, offer advice or help secure financing.

A turning point had come in 2005. Mr. Kennedy gave a speech at the home of Mr. Salzman, the managing partner of VantagePoint Capital Partners, then one of California's most prominent venture capital firms. It was an early investor in Tesla, the electric carmaker, and was known for backing companies that were offering solutions to the planet's environmental problems.

Mr. Salzman hired Mr. Kennedy in 2007, initially paying him $100,000 a year to consult on potential investments. ""He was obviously passionate about clean water, but also well-connected and very knowledgeable,"" Mr. Salzman told The Times.

In 2009 Mr. Kennedy became a partner, earning $340,000 at VantagePoint, in addition to his other sources of income. Two years later his salary had jumped to more than $750,000, records show.

Mr. Kennedy's position at VantagePoint led to other paying gigs at companies in which the fund had invested. For instance, he took in $80,000 a year from BrightSource, a developer of large-scale solar plants.

That work put him in conflict with environmentalists over two projects BrightSource was planning in California. The first was set for the Ivanpah Valley, in the desert near Nevada. A number of environmental groups opposed the idea, saying it threatened desert tortoises and vegetation.

Mr. Kennedy leaned on his contacts in the Obama administration to secure a $1.6 billion loan guarantee for the project in 2011. ""I essentially saved the company,"" Mr. Kennedy said in the 2012 deposition.

BrightSource also wanted to locate a massive solar power farm in a region of the Mojave Desert, on land previously earmarked for conservation. David Myers, president of the Wildlands Conservancy, was among its most vocal opponents, along with Senator Dianne Feinstein, the California Democrat who died this fall, and officials from the Sierra Club and the Center for Biological Diversity.

Mr. Myers said he had long admired Mr. Kennedy's work in New York and was devastated by his involvement in pushing the California project. ""He was like a hero, in his own mind,"" Mr. Myers said. After a protracted fight, BrightSource walked away from the venture.

In the interview with The Times, Mr. Kennedy said he had sympathy for the point of view of the project's opponents, but he believed it was vital to promote solar energy.

Ultimately, Mr. Kennedy worked for or served on the boards of at least 16 companies, all while juggling his speaking commitments, his duties at the nonprofits that were paying him and his obligations to his law firm. He joined the board of a holding company that owned a troubled for-profit college in New York, was a paid adviser to an Arizona environmental company known for hiring boldface names and was on the board of a Florida company that made red-light cameras.

Mr. Kennedy ended up on the board of that company, Smart Citation Management, because a friend knew he was hard up for cash and recommended him for the position, he said in the 2012 deposition. George K. Stephenson, the president of Smart Citation, described Mr. Kennedy as a ""very engaged"" board member.

At least one company with ties to the Kennedy family still has Mr. Kennedy on its payroll. Marwood Group, a political research firm, has paid him $10,000 a month for years, records show.

Its president and founder is Ted Kennedy Jr., Mr. Kennedy's cousin. The company did not respond to requests for comment. Mr. Kennedy said he served as an adviser and consultant.

A Shift to Vaccines

Around the time Mr. Kennedy spoke at Mr. Salzman's house, he became interested in another topic: mercury in vaccines.

For years, Mr. Kennedy had been warning about mercury contamination from coal-fired power plants, and he has said that concern grew to include vaccines when the mother of a ""vaccine-injured child"" came to him for help. In 2005 he wrote an article, published in Rolling Stone and Salon, that blamed thimerosal, a mercury-containing preservative used in some vaccines, for a rise in autism in children.

Although both news outlets later withdrew the article after finding that some of its claims were wrong or dubious, and Mr. Kennedy was widely criticized by the scientific community, he dove headlong into his effort. He began giving speeches on the topic, and wrote a book about it in 2015. He did not give up his environmental work: That same year, he began taking about $200,000 in annual salary from Waterkeeper Alliance, a national organization with a mission to clean up waterways.

But he also joined the board of a nonprofit organization called the World Mercury Project, which aimed to eliminate mercury exposure in many arenas. In 2018, with Mr. Kennedy's help, it was rebranded as Children's Health Defense.

Mr. Kennedy proved to be an effective fund-raiser for the fledgling group, just as he had for his environmental allies, even selling $10 raffle tickets to win a tour of the Cape Cod compound. In 2021, the last year for which data is available, the group's annual revenue was almost $16 million. With an impressive war chest, Children's Health Defense has become one of the country's leading spreaders of vaccine misinformation.

As Mr. Kennedy's focus shifted more and more to vaccine skepticism, he parted ways with the environmental groups that had defined so much of his public life. In 2017 he told Tucker Carlson, then a Fox News host, that his vaccine work had made him a pariah in some circles and cost him work.

""It's been probably the worst career move that I've ever made,"" he said. When Mr. Carlson asked him if he was ""getting paid for this,"" Mr. Kennedy replied: ""No, I'm not. In fact, I'm getting unpaid for this.""

Except for the Marwood Group, Mr. Kennedy no longer holds paid board positions, according to his F.E.C. filing, and he reported taking in a much-diminished $24,000 in speaking fees.

But his effort on vaccines has also been a source of income that would be impressive by many measures.

By 2021, the last full year for which data is available, he was making slightly more than $500,000 a year at Children's Health Defense, up from $255,000 in 2019.

After writing his book about thimerosal, he returned to his publisher, Skyhorse Publishing, to write a scathing book in 2021 about Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, the federal government's long-serving top infectious disease specialist who became a focus of rage for people skeptical of the coronavirus vaccine.

The book sold well, more than 500,000 copies in hardcover, according to Circana BookScan. Mr. Kennedy said he donated the proceeds to Children's Health Defense, but he received a $125,000 consulting fee from the publisher over this year and last for referring other authors.

Similar to his playbook as an environmentalist, Mr. Kennedy has established profitable relationships with law firms, including one that handles legal work for Children's Health Defense. Mr. Kennedy told The Times that because he believed his stance on vaccines had cost him income, he had an agreement with Children's Health Defense to supplement his salary with outside legal work.

""I had these big bills that I just couldn't pay on a badly diminished salary,"" he told The Times.

""I said, 'I need an opportunity to make more because that is not going to do it,'"" Mr. Kennedy said. Under the deal, he would share the proceeds from any legal wins or settlements with the organization.

One firm, the California-based Wisner Baum, paid him $1.6 million over the 18 months ending in June, according to his F.E.C. filing. Over the years, he has worked on environmental cases for Wisner Baum, including as a lawyer on the team that won a $290 million judgment against the chemical giant Monsanto, the maker of Roundup weed killer.

More recently, however, Mr. Kennedy has been listed as co-counsel on dozens of lawsuits that Wisner Baum has brought against the pharmaceutical company Merck for injuries it says were caused by a vaccine formulated to prevent the transmission of human papillomavirus.

The Children's Health Defense website also scouts clients for Wisner Baum, encouraging parents to call the firm if they believe their child might have been harmed by the HPV vaccine.

Another law firm, JW Howard Attorneys, paid Mr. Kennedy about $315,000 over the same 18-month period. JW Howard was one of the firms that handled a case brought by the Orange County Board of Education and Children's Health Defense seeking to end the Covid-19 state of emergency that California declared in the spring of 2020.

And this past January, JW Howard was counsel on a lawsuit filed by Children's Health Defense and Mr. Kennedy against The Washington Post, Reuters and other news organizations, accusing them of colluding to stop the publication of certain Covid stories, among other allegations.

Mr. Kennedy is also still a partner at Kennedy & Madonna. Between January 2022 and June 2023, he made $5 million for his work there, records show. The law firm, its website has emphasized, does not take vaccine cases.

The tribe’s roughly 20,000 members rely on the land in the eastern province of West Papua for their subsistence, but their case was thrown out

An indigenous tribe in Indonesia is at risk of losing vast swathes of ancestral forest after a court threw out its lawsuit against a palm oil firm, rights groups say.

The Awyu tribe, whose roughly 20,000 members rely on the land for their subsistence, had sought to freeze the operations of PT Indo Asiana Lestari (PT IAL) in the eastern Indonesian province of West Papua.

But on Thursday, a Papuan court upheld the firm’s concession permit, which allows for the potential clearance of more than 39,000 hectares (96,000 acres) of indigenous forest land.

“The decision … is bad news for Awyu Indigenous People who are struggling to defend their customary land,” the Coalition to Save Papuan Customary Forests, made up of 10 environmental NGOs, said in a statement on Thursday.In India, a remote island tribe risks losing its voice and cultural identity

The company’s general manager did not respond to an AFP request for comment.

Palm oil is a billion-dollar industry in Indonesia, which is the world’s largest producer and exporter of the commodity used in everything from chocolate spreads to cosmetics.

The environmental coalition claimed that PT IAL’s maps did not acknowledge local clans and environmental assessments did not involve Indigenous communities.

The coalition also claimed opponents of the firm’s plans faced intimidation.

“I am extremely sad and disappointed because our legal struggle appears to have been in vain. But I’ll never back down,” plaintiff Hendrikus Woro, an environmental activist from the tribe, said in a statement.

His lawyer Tigor Hutapea of the environmental NGO Bentala Rakyat Heritage Foundation said the court had made the “worst ruling” he had ever read on the enforcement of environmental law.

“The judges ignored the presented evidence. The judges did not have an environmental law perspective, and the judges narrowed their reasoning,” he said on Friday.Indonesian tribe to sue Australia over ownership of oil-rich islands

The court ruled PT IAL’s permit was valid, rejecting the tribe’s argument that the concession had been granted based on a flawed environmental impact analysis, said Hutapea.

Hutapea said his client will appeal against the decision.

Indonesia produces about 60 per cent of the world’s palm oil, with one-third consumed by its domestic market.

The European Union agreed last year to ban palm oil imports linked to deforestation.","{'uri': 'scmp.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'South China Morning Post'}",[],https://cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/d8/images/canvas/2023/11/03/9e5d14a1-7147-411f-ae97-d84872943d83_39075250.jpg?itok=TQJFcCQr,eng-9030139,-0.2470588235294118,26,26,South China Morning Post,scmp.com

A contractor crew working for the county's Department of Public Works was enhancing the channel's flood control capacity on Oct. 6, 2022, when a worker drove a segment of sheet piling into an abandoned pipeline near Indianapolis Avenue.

Oil soon after began bubbling up into the waters of the channel, prompting immediate containment efforts. A unified command response comprising county staff, Chevron representatives and state and local agencies worked to prevent impacts to the Talbert Marsh downstream.

Approximately 60 gallons of pollutants were ultimately recovered from the Talbert Channel, according to the agreement.

Although the collaboration -- coming one year after a ruptured underwater pipeline spilled 25,000 gallons of oil into the waters off Huntington Beach -- was swift and effective, a dispute later arose in which Orange County and Chevron each alleged the leakage was the result of negligence on behalf of the other party.

County officials claimed the oil company, which has owned the pipeline since the 1940s, failed to properly purge its contents when it was abandoned in the '60s and was unable to provide record of its existence after the leakage occurred.

Chevron contended the county, which cut and capped the pipe in 1997, should have removed any remaining oil inside the infrastructure upon discovery.

As part of the settlement, Chevron has 30 days from the document's Tuesday signoff to procure the required $1.25 million. Both parties have agreed to release one another from any future claims or causes of legal action.

The document, however, does not exempt Chevron from taking future legal actions against the construction crew hired by the county or any other entities related to the incident.

The county is similarly capable of seeking further legal action against other parties, County Counsel Leon Page said Tuesday, reporting from a closed session meeting of the Orange County Board of Supervisors.

""The county reserves its right to proceed against other parties in connection with this spill and will continue to vigorously enforce reimbursement rights under federal and state environmental laws for the protection of all resident taxpayers,"" Page reported.

The document also specifies that neither party, in signing the settlement, is accepting blame for the incident.

""The county and Chevron have categorically and specifically denied and continue to deny any liability or wrongdoing of any kind associated with the dispute and/or the spill,"" it states.

Fifth District Supervisor Katrina Foley, who advocated for taking legal action against Chevron if representatives failed to reach an agreement, lauded the news.

""The $1.25-million settlement will reimburse the taxpayers for the Talbert Flood Channel oil leak,"" Foley said in a statement Tuesday. ""This settlement reflects Chevron taking responsibility for the abandoned pipeline.""","{'uri': 'latimes.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'Los Angeles Times'}",[],https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/54333b3/2147483647/strip/true/crop/4032x2268+0+756/resize/1200x675!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fd0%2F65%2F1ac10d2a40d79af7e8b79e40a677%2Fsheen-main.jpg,,0.02745098039215677,4,4,Los Angeles Times,latimes.com

(CBS DETROIT) - It's been several months since the state's distracted driving law took effect over the summer.

Law enforcement in Oakland County said they are still seeing drivers using their phones while on the road.

""Some days people are obeying the law and not using their phones, and other days you can't go a mile without someone either manipulating their phone or having it in their hand because they can't put it down,"" said Deputy Chad Abbuhl with the Oakland County Sheriff's Department.

Abbuhl said the new law requires drivers to use their cell phones or other devices hands-free, but the law also extends beyond handheld devices.

""I've seen people doing makeup while they're driving, doing work presentations while they're driving, highlighting stuff and going over notes for work, have it all over the dashboard, that's also distracted driving,"" Abbuhl said.

Even if stopped at a red light or stop sign, drivers are still not allowed to have their cell phones in their hands.

""You're still in operation of the vehicle, and that's still considered distracted driving,"" Abbuhl said.

During a ride-along, Abbuhl observed several drivers with their devices in hand, including one woman who was seen texting at a red light. She was stopped and was given a warning. Surprisingly, she said she didn't know about the new law.

""So I explained to her what she did, and she said she was unaware of the cell phone, hands-free distracted driving law,"" Abbuhl said.

Abbuhl said the goal is not for law enforcement to write more tickets; the law is clearly designed to make our roads safer.

""There have been lives that have been lost because of it; we're just out here trying to educate people and let them know the dangers of using their phone while they are driving,"" Abbuhl said.","{'uri': 'cbsnews.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'CBS News'}",[],https://assets3.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2023/11/21/61fea0a9-3219-403c-b963-5fc14cf914c7/thumbnail/1200x630/8ae80c7bc832bcd62a715d6729159b4b/screenshot-2023-11-21-094116.png?v=5659e73acd91751548aa89950cf015b0,,-0.03529411764705881,25,25,CBS News,cbsnews.com

The Supreme Court said people working for Deliveroo couldn't be considered employees because they don't have specified hours, can work for rival companies, and can appoint someone to work in their place.

The arrangement between Deliveroo and its riders is ""fundamentally inconsistent with any notion of an employment relationship"", its judgment said.

Deliveroo riders had sought collective bargaining rights and the case was brought by the Independent Workers Union of Great Britain (IWGB).

They had tried to negotiate pay and conditions with the company, but were refused in 2017 as the members did not meet the definition of a worker under UK law.

A series of appeals were launched, culminating in the Supreme Court decision, which said they cannot benefit from union membership as they do not meet the definition of a worker or employee.

The IWGB had argued Deliveroo unlawfully interfered with riders' human rights by denying their application to be recognised for collective bargaining purposes.

Workers, under UK employment law, cannot be discriminated against nor have unlawful wage deductions - but don't receive the full range of legal rights conferred on employees.

Just over two years ago, Uber lost its Supreme Court battle and drivers were recognised as workers, not independent third-party contractors, meaning they are entitled to basic employment protections such as the minimum wage.

In the Uber case, judges concluded that drivers are ""in a position of subordination and dependency to Uber, such that they have little or no ability to improve their position through professional or entrepreneurial skills"".

The IWGB said it was disappointed at the Deliveroo ruling and was considering its options.

""Whether reflected in legislation or not, couriers are joining the union in ever bigger numbers and building our collective power to take action and hold companies like Deliveroo to account,"" a statement said.

""Our strength lies not in court rulings but in our unity as a workforce coming together to demand change.""

A Deliveroo spokesperson said: ""UK courts repeatedly and at every level have confirmed that Deliveroo riders are self-employed, and this now includes the Supreme Court, the highest court in the country.

Three prominent US legal thinkers have announced a new organisation to champion conservative legal theory within the rule of law, to fight the threat of a second Donald Trump term.

""Our country comes first,"" the three wrote in the New York Times, ""and our country is in a constitutional emergency, if not a constitutional crisis. We all must act accordingly, especially us lawyers.""

The authors were George Conway, an attorney formerly married to Kellyanne Conway, Trump's White House counselor; J Michael Luttig, a retired judge and adviser to Trump's vice-president, Mike Pence, who became a prominent January 6 witness; and Barbara Comstock, a former Republican congresswoman from Virginia.

The authors also rebuked prominent rightwing groups including the Federalist Society for not resisting the former president and his authoritarian ambitions.

Their new group, the Society for the Rule of Law Institute, would ""work to inspire young legal talent ... focus on building a large body of scholarship to counteract the new orthodoxy of anti-constitutional and anti-democratic law ... [and] marshal principled voices to speak out against the endless stream of falsehoods and authoritarian legal theories ... propagated almost daily,"" they said.

The Federalist Society and its chair, Leonard Leo, played a key role in Trump's judicial appointments, installing three hardliners on the supreme court who helped hand down rightwing wins including removing abortion rights and loosening laws on gun control, affirmative action, voting rights and other progressive priorities.

Conway, Luttig and Comstock emerged among prominent conservative opponents of Trump, warning of his authoritarian threat before and after January 6, when rioters attacked Congress in an attempt to block Joe Biden's 2020 election win.

Ninety-one criminal charges and assorted civil threats notwithstanding, Trump is now the clear frontrunner for the Republican presidential nomination while polling strongly against Biden in battleground states.

""American democracy, the constitution and the rule of law are the righteous causes of our times, and the nation's legal profession is obligated to support them,"" Conway, Luttig and Comstock wrote.

""But with the acquiescence of the larger conservative legal movement, these pillars of our system of governance are increasingly in peril. The dangers will only grow should Donald Trump be returned to the White House next November.""

Trump, they said, would stock a second administration ""with partisan loyalists committed to fast-tracking his agenda and sidestepping - if not circumventing altogether - existing laws and long-established legal norms.

""This would include appointing ... political appointees to rubber-stamp his plans to investigate and exact retribution against his political opponents; make federal public servants removable at will by the president himself; and invoke special powers to take unilateral action on first amendment-protected activities, criminal justice, elections, immigration and more.""

The Duke of Sussex's lawyers are planning to ask ministers for permission to use confidential Leveson Inquiry documents in his legal action against the publisher of the Daily Mail, the High Court has been told.

Harry, alongside a number of other high-profile people, is suing Associated Newspapers Limited (ANL) over denied allegations of unlawful information gathering.

In a judgment earlier this month, a High Court judge ruled that the legal challenges could continue but could not use information drawn from ledgers given by ANL to the Leveson Inquiry into press standards in 2011 and 2012.

ANL argued that the documents were provided with the understanding that they were confidential and were covered by publication restriction orders over their use.

Mr Justice Nicklin concluded that Harry's lawyers using information from the ledgers to support his case was a breach of a restriction order made by the inquiry's chair Sir Brian Leveson.

At a follow-up hearing in London on Tuesday, the duke's barrister David Sherborne said his legal team's ""next step"" was to write to the Government over varying the Leveson Inquiry restriction to allow material to be used.

The court was told by ANL that it had rejected a request to hand over the ledgers voluntarily and would oppose a bid to ask a minister for access to them.

Adrian Beltrami KC, for the publisher, said in written arguments that in a situation where ""much, if not all"" of the cases brought by the duke and others ""may be unsustainable when shorn of information illegitimately drawn from the ledgers"" there could be ""no safe assumption"" over whether they can be disclosed at a later stage.

He said the ledgers had been given to Harry's lawyers in breach of ""clear obligations"" of confidentiality, adding lawyers had ""acted tactically and cynically in seeking to use such illegitimately obtained information to support their speculative claims"".

Mr Beltrami said any argument that ANL's refusal to share the material ""is merely a delaying tactic"" at this stage in the legal action was ""wholly misplaced and strongly rejected"".

Mr Sherborne, representing Harry and other individuals, said in written arguments that there appeared to be ""no rationale"" for ANL refusing to provide the ""plainly relevant"" documents at this stage ""other than perhaps to score a tactical advantage over the claimants and delay progress of the claims"".

The barrister said that given ANL had described the legal challenges as ""preposterous"" and said that it has ""nothing to hide"" it would be ""surprising"" for the publisher not to provide the material voluntarily.

""The claimants ask, rhetorically, what legitimate reason is there for the defendant not to do so if it genuinely believes that the allegations of unlawful conduct made against it are without foundation, as it has so repeatedly claimed,"" Mr Sherborne said.

The hearing, which dealt with consequences of the ruling, including the payment of legal costs, concluded on Tuesday.

A further case management may be held in early March next year.

Harry is joined by singer Sir Elton John in suing ANL, as well as campaigner Baroness Doreen Lawrence who watched some of the hearing from a public gallery at the Royal Courts of Justice.

The trio are among a group - including Sir Elton's husband David Furnish, actresses Sadie Frost and Liz Hurley and ex-MP Sir Simon Hughes - accusing the publisher of carrying out or commissioning unlawful activities such as hiring private investigators to listen in to phone calls, intercept voicemail messages, and ""blag"" private records through deception.

ANL, which firmly denies the allegations, previously asked Mr Justice Nicklin at a hearing in March to rule in its favour without a trial, arguing the legal challenges were brought ""far too late"".

But the judge ruled ANL had ""not been able to deliver a 'knockout blow' to the claims"" in his judgment on November 10.

Following the ruling, ANL said in a statement: ""As we have always made unequivocally clear, the lurid claims made by Prince Harry and others of phone hacking, landline tapping, burglary and sticky-window microphones are simply preposterous and we look forward to establishing this in court in due course.""","{'uri': 'independent.co.uk', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'The Independent'}",[],https://static.independent.co.uk/2023/11/21/14/a524410709ef56a1d1ea2161a6e7aa5bY29udGVudHNlYXJjaGFwaSwxNzAwNjU5ODEx-2.74519107.jpg?quality=75&width=1200&auto=webp,eng-9079670,-0.05882352941176472,25,25,The Independent,independent.co.uk

The Independent Workers Union of Great Britain sought to represent Deliveroo riders to improve working conditions for the people who scurry around the nation´s streets delivering takeout meals to customers. When Deliveroo refused to negotiate with the union, the workers appealed, arguing that the company was violating rights guaranteed by the European Convention on Human Rights.

The court rejected the appeal, ruling that the right to collective bargaining is only guaranteed when there is an ""employment relationship"" between the workers and the company. Deliveroo riders aren´t employees because their contract with the company gives them the ""virtually unfettered right to appoint a substitute to take on their jobs,"" the court said.

Deliveroo welcomed the decision, saying it confirmed lower court rulings that the company´s riders are self-employed.

""This is a positive judgment for Deliveroo riders, who value the flexibility that self-employed work offers,"" the company said in a statement.

The union called the ruling a ""disappointment.""

""Flexibility, including the option for account substitution, is no reason to strip workers of basic entitlements like fair pay and collective bargaining rights,"" the union said. ""This dangerous false dichotomy between rights and flexibility is one that Deliveroo and other gig economy giants rely heavily upon in efforts to legitimize their exploitative business models.""","{'uri': 'dailymail.co.uk', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'Daily Mail Online'}",[],,eng-9080034,0.06666666666666665,25,25,Daily Mail Online,dailymail.co.uk

The 2-1 decision by a panel of the 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals based in St. Louis found that only the attorney general can enforce Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act, which requires political maps to include districts where minority populations' preferred candidates can win elections.

The majority said other federal laws, including the 1964 Civil Rights Act, make it clear when private groups can sue but said similar wording is not found in the voting law.

""When those details are missing, it is not our place to fill in the gaps, except when 'text and structure' require it,"" Circuit Judge David R. Stras wrote for the majority in an opinion joined by Judge Raymond W. Gruender. Stras was nominated by former President Donald Trump and Gruender by former President George W. Bush.

The decision affirmed a lower judge's decision to dismiss a case brought by the Arkansas State Conference NAACP and the Arkansas Public Policy Panel after giving Attorney General Merrick Garland five days to join the lawsuit.

Chief Judge Lavenski R. Smith noted in a dissenting opinion that federal courts across the country and the Supreme Court have considered numerous cases brought by private plaintiffs under Section 2. Smith said the court should follow ""existing precedent that permits a judicial remedy"" unless the Supreme Court or Congress decides differently.

""Rights so foundational to self-government and citizenship should not depend solely on the discretion or availability of the government's agents for protection,"" wrote Smith, another appointee of Bush.

Sophia Lin Lakin, director of the ACLU's Voting Rights Project, called the ruling a ""travesty for democracy."" She had argued the appeal on behalf of the two Arkansas groups.

""By failing to reverse the district court's radical decision, the Eighth Circuit has put the Voting Rights Act in jeopardy, tossing aside critical protections that voters fought and died for,"" Lakin said in a statement.

It was not immediately clear whether the groups would appeal. A statement from the ACLU said they are exploring their options.

Barry Jefferson, political action chair of the Arkansas State Conference of the NAACP, called the ruling ""a devastating blow to the civil rights of every American, and the integrity of our nation's electoral system.""

The state NAACP chapter and the public policy group had challenged new Arkansas state House districts as diluting the influence of Black voters. The state's redistricting plan created 11 majority-Black districts, which the groups argued was too few. They said the state could have drawn 16 majority-Black districts to more closely mirror the state's demographics.

U.S. District Judge Lee Rudofsky noted there was ""a strong merits case that at least some of the challenged districts"" in the lawsuit violate the federal Voting Rights Act but said he could not rule after concluding a challenge could only be brought by the attorney general.

The Justice Department filed a ""statement of interest"" in the case saying private parties can file lawsuits to enforce the Voting Rights Act but declined to comment on the ruling.

Monday's ruling applies only to federal courts covered by the 8th Circuit, which includes Arkansas, Iowa, Minnesota, Missouri, Nebraska, North Dakota and South Dakota. Meanwhile, several pending lawsuits by private groups challenge various political maps drawn by legislators across the country.

It's likely the case eventually will make it to the Supreme Court, where the issue was raised in a 2021 opinion by Justice Neil Gorsuch.

""I join the court's opinion in full, but flag one thing it does not decide,"" Gorsuch wrote at the time, joined by Justice Clarence Thomas. ""Our cases have assumed -- without deciding -- that the Voting Rights Act of 1965 furnishes an implied cause of action under section 2.""

Gorsuch wrote that there was no need in that case for the justices to consider who may sue. But Gorsuch and Thomas were among the dissenters in June when the Supreme Court ruled 5-4 in another Voting Rights Act case in favor of Black voters in Alabama who objected to the state's congressional districts.

The Gorsuch and Thomas opinion was referenced less than two weeks ago in another federal court decision that came to the opposite conclusion of Monday's ruling by the St. Louis-based court.

On Nov. 10, three judges on the conservative-dominated 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in New Orleans rejected arguments that there is no private right to sue under the Voting Rights Act. In a Louisiana congressional redistricting case, the panel said the Supreme Court so far has upheld the right of private litigants to bring lawsuits alleging violations of Section 2, as have other appellate courts.

Fifth Circuit Judge Leslie Southwick, a nominee of Bush, pointed to separate cases from 1999 and 2020 that reaffirmed that right.

Election law experts say most challenges seeking to enforce Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act are brought by private plaintiffs and that the Justice Department has limited resources to pursue such cases. Some voting rights experts also noted the apparent contradiction in the Alabama case decided by the Supreme Court last June and Monday's ruling by the appellate court.

""It doesn't seem to make sense,"" said Jon Greenbaum, chief counsel for the Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights Under Law. ""If the laws were that private parties couldn't bring these cases, then the Alabama case would have never even gotten off the ground.""

Lawsuits under Section 2 have long been used to try to ensure that Black voters have adequate political representation in places with a long history of racism, including many Southern states. Racial gerrymandering has been used in drawing legislative and congressional districts to pack Black voters into a small number of districts or spread them out so their votes are diluted. If only the attorney general is able to file such cases, it could sharply limit their number and make challenges largely dependent on partisan politics.

It's unlikely Congress will be willing to act. Republicans have blocked recent efforts to restore protections in the Voting Rights Act that were tossed out by the Supreme Court a decade ago. In the 2013 Shelby v. Holder decision, justices dismantled an enforcement mechanism known as preclearance, which allowed for federal review of proposed election-related changes before they could take effect in certain states and communities with a history of discrimination.

In a statement, the Congressional Black Caucus noted that private individuals and civil rights groups have been successful in giving Black voters better representation through recent challenges to congressional maps drawn by Republican lawmakers in Alabama, Louisiana and Florida.

""This decision by the appellate court is ill-advised, cannot stand, and should be appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court, which we hope will reaffirm that citizens have a private right of action to bring forward lawsuits under Section 2,"" the group said.","{'uri': 'cbsnews.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'CBS News'}",[],https://assets1.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2023/11/21/3881d167-9540-4d11-b07c-054dfe07b039/thumbnail/1200x630g2/1ecc4c77c6dd7058a55e1660ffca9f50/ap18141819852808.jpg?v=5659e73acd91751548aa89950cf015b0,eng-9078082,0.09019607843137245,25,25,CBS News,cbsnews.com

The government considered releasing the man who sparked the landmark ruling on indefinite detention - even though he raped a 10-year-old boy - in a bid to stave off the high court challenge that led to the release of 92 others.

According to documents published by the high court, on 26 May an assistant secretary in the home affairs department wrote to the offices of both ministers responsible in an email titled ""NZYQ v Minister ... indefinite detention / Al Kateb challenge ... proposal to reconsider exercising ministerial intervention powers under the Act in light of litigation risk"".

The phrase ""ministerial intervention powers"" appears to be a reference to Migration Act powers to grant a visa, releasing NZYQ from detention and removing the foundation for the high court challenge.

The email calls into question a claim made by the home affairs minister, Clare O'Neil, on Sunday that the government was advised it was ""likely"" to win the case.

The documents also confirm that approaches were made to Five Eyes countries to deport the plaintiff, NZYQ, only after the government had agreed to the special case, which conceded it was likely impossible to deport him.

That concession opened the way for the high court to overturn the 2004 decision in which the court controversially found that indefinite detention is lawful even where it is not possible to deport the unlawful non-citizen.

In the wake of fierce Coalition criticism about Labor's handling of the aftermath of the case, O'Neil said the Albanese government ""had properly prepared for the decision"" despite thinking it was likely to win.

""We knew that there was a high court action on foot. We knew that it was 20 years of legal precedent and we were advised that it was likely that the commonwealth would win the case - that is, allow us to do what we wanted to do, which is keep these people in detention,"" O'Neil said on Sunday.

O'Neil said the comments were ""referring to operational advice from my department which detailed efforts to remove the individual in this case from Australia"".

""This would have meant that this case may not have needed to proceed,"" she told Guardian Australia.

""I was not referring to legal advice. I do not discuss legal advice received by the commonwealth.""

""The commonwealth and my department have been preparing for the loss for some time. This is why work was undertaken before the high court handed down its ruling.""

The 26 May email is contained in court documents evidencing efforts to resolve the case of NZYQ, the stateless Rohingyan man who brought the landmark case.

The email was written by Marian Agbinya, the assistant secretary of the migration and citizenship litigation branch, and addressed to a senior adviser in the office of the immigration minister, Andrew Giles.

More than a dozen others are copied in, including the departmental liaison officers and chiefs of staff in both Giles' and O'Neil's offices, the home affairs department secretary, Michael Pezzullo, and the associate secretary of immigration, Stephanie Foster.

Only the subject line is visible. The entire contents of the email is redacted because it is sensitive and subject to legal professional privilege, indicating it contains legal advice.

NZYQ's bridging visa was cancelled in 2015 when he pleaded guilty to sexual intercourse with a 10-year-old minor. In February 2023 Giles refused to use personal powers to allow NZYQ to reapply for a visa.

NZYQ filed his case in the high court on 5 April. The email's reference to ""ministerial intervention"" indicates the government reconsidered whether to release NZYQ just weeks after the case was launched and just months after the refusal.

On 8 November the high court ruled in favour of the man, which has triggered the release of 93 people in long-term detention for whom there is no ""real prospect"" that removal will be ""reasonably practicable in the foreseeable future"".

On the first day of the hearing, lawyers for NZYQ complained that the government only asked Five Eyes allies, Bangladesh and Saudi Arabia to resettle him ""under the shadow of this litigation"".

While the other nations responded negatively, the United States committed to having a ""hard look"" at the case, leading the government to argue it was ""continuing to take steps directed to the plaintiff's removal by seeking to identify countries to which he could be removed"".

Asked repeatedly on Monday why the government did not approach other nations to take NZYQ until after the it agreed to the special case on 30 May establishing it was impossible to deport him, O'Neil declined to answer.

""The NZYQ case has been before the high court, the information is there. I don't have any[thing] further to add about the proceedings at this stage,"" she said.

O'Neil also did not answer whether she signed off on the special case on 30 May or whether it was Giles.

The opposition home affairs spokesperson, James Paterson, said the government still had questions to answer over what actions were taken to deport in the lead-up to NZYQ's successful high court challenge, which could see up to 340 people in detention for more than a year released.

The government has spent the last week under intense political attack from the opposition over the high court decision, which led to urgent legislation being passed in the parliament imposing strict monitoring conditions on people released under the court order.

Labor has maintained that community safety has been at the forefront of its response to the court decision, while the Law Council of Australia has called for an immediate review of the legislation passed last week.","{'uri': 'theguardian.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","[{'uri': 'paul_karp@theguardian.com', 'name': 'Paul Karp', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': False}, {'uri': 'amy_remeikis@theguardian.com', 'name': 'Amy Remeikis', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': False}]",https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7490ff070e0c382a9b6d07537b3fa9bf1d72852d/1786_427_4237_2542/master/4237.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&s=bd8cb48bda17c1591ab052edf9fc93a8,eng-9074360,0.04313725490196085,25,25,The Guardian,theguardian.com

Deliveroo riders do not have the right to collective negotiations on pay and conditions, the UK's top court has ruled, in a blow to gig economy campaigners and the unions that represent them.

The Independent Workers' Union of Great Britain (IWGB) has been fighting through the courts since 2017 to have Deliveroo riders classified as ""workers"", with the right to unionise and bargain collectively for better terms and conditions.

On Tuesday, the supreme court upheld previous judgments that the thousands of UK riders were independent self-employed contractors, and could not be classed as workers because they had the right to arrange a substitute to perform their duties if they did not want to or were unable to.

The union said it was considering its options to challenge the ruling under international law - having reached the UK's highest court. Any challenge would be likely to involve taking the case to the European court of human rights, with a challenge brought against the UK government rather than Deliveroo, lawyers said.

""The supreme court's ruling comes as a disappointment after years spent fighting a legal battle to secure riders' bare minimum employment rights. As a union we cannot accept that thousands of riders should be working without key protections like the right to collective bargaining, and we will continue to make that case using all avenues available to us,"" IWGB said in a statement, adding that it was continuing to sign up more gig economy couriers in an attempt to hold companies to account.

""Flexibility, including the option for account substitution, is no reason to strip workers of basic entitlements like fair pay and collective bargaining rights. This dangerous false dichotomy between rights and flexibility is one that Deliveroo and other gig economy giants rely heavily upon in efforts to legitimise their exploitative business models,"" IWGB said.

Deliveroo said the outcome was ""a positive judgment for Deliveroo riders, who value the flexibility that self-employed work offers"", and that thousands of people continued to apply to work with Deliveroo every week.

It pointed to a deal with the GMB union under which riders receive free insurance, sickness cover and union recognition without being recognised as workers or employees. The ruling leaves the employer free to choose which union it might wish to recognise, without the risk of a challenge that it has not chosen its workers' preferred organisation.

Deliveroo said: ""UK courts repeatedly and at every level have confirmed that Deliveroo riders are self-employed, and this now includes the supreme court, the highest court in the country.

Yvonne Gallagher, partner at law firm Harbottle & Lewis said the case was ""a fundamentally important ruling for the gig economy, not just for Deliveroo.

""In establishing that the substitution clause works as a proof that riders cannot be considered workers, the supreme court ruling may give rise to other gig economy companies following the Deliveroo employment approach - where it fits their commercial model.""

She said that in the UK ""in many cases, the use of substitution clauses means that gig workers will not attract [basic employment rights such as the minimum wage and holiday pay]"".

Gallagher added that if IWGB wanted to challenge the supreme court ruling in international courts it would have to make a claim in the European court of human rights to argue that the UK has failed to implement its treaty obligations properly - so it would be ""a claim brought against the government"".

""Such claims can succeed in forcing governments to change the law, but insisting on widening the definition of those who qualify for employment rights does look quite a stretch,"" she said.","{'uri': 'theguardian.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","[{'uri': 'sarah_butler@theguardian.com', 'name': 'Sarah Butler', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': False}]",https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b4924447ffde04d42d48d3c47a86f276980235ee/0_118_4816_2890/master/4816.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&s=4b60a0520afdca59677283f154ece60b,eng-9080034,0.1529411764705881,25,25,The Guardian,theguardian.com

Mr Adams says claims against the Provisional IRA should be struck out - the three claimants disagree.

Lawyers representing Mr Adams and the three claimants are outlining legal arguments at a High Court hearing at the Royal Courts of Justice complex in London.

The hearing is due to end on Wednesday.

Barrister Richard Hermer KC, who is leading Mr Adams's legal team, described the case as ""unusual"".

He said the Provisional IRA was an ""unincorporated association"" which was ""incapable in law of being sued"".

Mr Hermer said the conduct of the claim had been ""characterised by a significant number of procedural breaches and irregularities"".

Barrister Anne Studd KC, who is leading the claimants' legal team, said each man alleged that Mr Adams was ""liable to them"" both as an ""individual given the part he played in the preparation and planning of the attacks"" and as a ""representative"" of the Provisional IRA.

""It is anticipated that (Mr Adams) will deny that he was ever a member of the (Provisional IRA), although currently the court should note that it has no evidence upon which to base that conclusion there being no defence entered and no statement from (Mr Adams) setting out his account,"" she told the judge in a written case outline.

""This case raises important issues on access to justice in cases where a group of claimants alleged the most heinous wrongdoing by an individual who they allege was a member of an organisation responsible for significant injury through terrorist means.

""If (Mr Adams's) application succeeds, then its effect would be to give a claimant no cause of action against an individual as a representative of an unincorporated association where the defendant seeks to deny such an association without submitting any evidence as is the case here.""

Beginning a legal challenge to the Northern Ireland Troubles (Legacy and Reconciliation) Act at Belfast High Court, barrister John Larkin KC also said that a new commission which will take over thousands of unsolved deaths would be the ""only show in town"" for victims but that its architecture was ""inadequate"" and ""defective"".

The Act received royal assent in September despite widespread opposition from political parties, victims' organisations in Northern Ireland and the Irish government.

Aspects of the laws include a limited form of immunity from prosecution for Troubles-related offences for those who co-operate with the new Independent Commission for Reconciliation and Information Recovery (ICRIR).

The new Act will also halt future civil cases and legacy inquests.

The legal challenge, being brought by a number of Troubles victims and heard by Mr Justice Colton, argues that the Act does not comply with human rights law.

Opening the proceedings, Mr Larkin read from the affidavits of a number of Troubles victims whose cases are being heard jointly.

These included the affidavit of Martina Dillon, whose husband Seamus was shot dead in Dungannon in 1997.

The barrister said Mrs Dillon's grief in losing her husband was as raw today as the night he was killed.

Her affidavit said that suspected perpetrators ""can safely sleep at night knowing they will never be held accountable"" as long as the Legacy Act exists.

Mr Larkin said the Troubles had left an ""enormous collective pain"".

He added: ""A pain created by individual events but a pain that is now subject to a form of secondary traumatisation through the provisions in this Act.""

Turning to the individual provisions of the Act, Mr Larkin said if the ICRIR had been created alongside existing structures there might be little to condemn it.

He added: ""But it is the fact that this is an exclusive body, inadequate in its capacities, which extinguishes existing rights, that however imperfectly have been use in an attempt to secure truth and justice.""

The barrister described references in the Act that the ICRIR would promote reconciliation as a form of ""meretricious window dressing"".

But the commission is the only show in town and it is a defective show John Larkin KC

He added: ""If the commission stood alone there might well be complaints one might make about it if one had the faculty of going to the commission instead of seeking an inquest or bringing civil proceedings or criminal proceedings.

""But the commission is the only show in town and it is a defective show, and other shows which have been established to have worked well in the past are closed down.""

Turning to the immunity provisions of the Act, Mr Larkin said the powers would go beyond any immunity powers granted to a public inquiry.

He said: ""All that is required is a truthful, incriminating account.

""There does not have to be any expression, sincere or otherwise of remorse, there does not have to be any acknowledgement of wrongdoing in a moral sense and the account can be accompanied by triumphalism, crowing, by glorification of the criminal act.

""The panel does not have any discretion, any rule for withholding immunity once conditions are met.

""In the context of a measure which is badged as promoting reconciliation, we say the structure for immunity is fundamentally antithetical to any proper approach to reconciliation and actively harms reconciliation.""

Mr Larkin said the Act did not address the suffering of victims, but instead shut it down.

I shouldn't have to be here today to go and fight for truth and justice which I believe I am entitled to Martina Dillon

Speaking before the case started, Mrs Dillon said she hoped the courts would listen to the voices of victims.

She said: ""I am here today to fight for my husband Seamus Dillon and for each and every other victim that needs this law to be changed, and for the courts to please listen and help us.""

""I shouldn't have to be here today to go and fight for truth and justice which I believe I am entitled to.""

Amnesty International, which is supporting the legal challenge, called on the Irish Government to proceed with an inter-state legal case against the legacy laws.

The case is being heard at the Royal Courts of Justice in Belfast (Liam McBurney/PA)

Grainne Teggart said: ""Today's case is hugely significant, not only for the victims challenging this law, but for every Troubles victim having truth and justice cruelly denied to them.

""We repeatedly warned the UK Government during the passage of this legislation that if they pushed this through to law, we would see them in court.

""That is what we are doing here today. Today is day one in the fightback against this law which prioritises perpetrators at the expense of victims' rights.""

She added: ""We call on the Irish Government to swiftly make a decision to take an inter-state case. It is not right that the burden of legal challenge falls solely on the shoulders of victims.

""We note that Leo Varadkar has said in recent days that a decision will be imminent in the coming weeks. We call on them to follow through with their opposition to this law and take that case.""

The Independent Workers Union of Great Britain (IWGB) wants to represent Deliveroo riders in north London in order to negotiate on issues of pay, hours and holiday with the company.

After losing a bid for recognition at a specialist tribunal in 2017, the IWGB unsuccessfully challenged that decision at the High Court and Court of Appeal, and in April the union took its case to the Supreme Court.

However, in a unanimous ruling on Tuesday, five justices at the UK's highest court dismissed the appeal.

Clearly there is nothing in the UK legislation to stop the riders from forming their own union or joining the union as they have done. There is also nothing to prevent Deliveroo from engaging in collective bargaining with the union to seek to agree the terms and conditions applied to the riders if they so choose Supreme Court judgment

In the judgment, Lord Lloyd-Jones and Lady Rose said they agreed with previous decisions that riders are not in an ""employment relationship"" with Deliveroo and are therefore not entitled to collective bargaining rights.

The justices said multiple factors, including that riders are free to reject offers of work and to work for Deliveroo's competitors, are ""fundamentally inconsistent"" with such a relationship.

Part of the case focused on whether the arrangement between the food delivery app and its riders fell under the scope of Article 11 of the European Convention on Human Rights - which covers the right to join trade unions.

Rejecting this argument, the justices said: ""Clearly there is nothing in the UK legislation to stop the riders from forming their own union or joining the union as they have done.

Deliveroo riders have protested against the pay and conditions offered by Deliveroo (Flora Bowen/PA)

""There is also nothing to prevent Deliveroo from engaging in collective bargaining with the union to seek to agree the terms and conditions applied to the riders if they so choose.""

They continued: ""The issue is whether Article 11 requires the United Kingdom to go beyond that current position and to enact legislation conferring on Article 11 workers the right to require their reluctant employer to recognise and negotiate with the union of their choice.""

The IWGB's initial application to be recognised for collective bargaining purposes was first refused by a specialist tribunal in November 2017.

The Central Arbitration Committee rejected the union's application as riders were able to pass a job to a substitute, meaning they were not obliged to provide a ""personal service"" and could not be classified as ""workers"".

Following the Supreme Court's ruling, a Deliveroo spokesperson said: ""UK courts repeatedly and at every level have confirmed that Deliveroo riders are self-employed, and this now includes the Supreme Court, the highest court in the country.

""This is a positive judgement for Deliveroo riders, who value the flexibility that self-employed work offers.

""Thousands apply each week to work with Deliveroo because they want to be able to decide for themselves when, where and whether to work.

""We are proud to be able to offer tens of thousands of riders this flexibility alongside the security of free insurance, sickness coverage, support for new parents and a unique union recognition agreement.

""We will continue to listen to and work with riders to offer them the work they tell us they want.""

In a statement, the IWGB said the ruling came as a ""disappointment"".

It continued: ""As a union we cannot accept that thousands of riders should be working without key protections like the right to collective bargaining, and we will continue to make that case using all avenues available to us, including considering our options under international law.""

The union added: ""Flexibility, including the option for account substitution, is no reason to strip workers of basic entitlements like fair pay and collective bargaining rights.

‘The judiciary is mindful that not all proceedings are suitable for live broadcasting,’ Legislative Council panel says

Hong Kong courts will start to live stream some proceedings early next year in a bid to boost public confidence in the city’s justice system.

The city’s judiciary told a Legislative Council panel on Tuesday that courts were planning to broadcast the cases deemed appropriate to the public.

“The judiciary is mindful that not all proceedings are suitable for live broadcasting,” the panel paper said. “The judiciary is examining the guiding principles as well as the implementation practicalities of live broadcasting of court proceedings.”

The plan was first announced by Chief Justice Andrew Cheung Kui-nung earlier during the opening of the legal year, with the top judge calling the move a “natural way forward”.

He added it would increase transparency and bolster confidence in the legal system.

The step will also bring Hong Kong in line with law jurisdictions in Britain, Canada, Australia, and the United States, all of which broadcast proceedings at their top courts.

The US Supreme Court only allows audio recordings of arguments during hearings as it upholds a ban on cameras in the courtroom. The High Court of Australia, meanwhile, provides audio and video recordings a day after it has finished sitting.

In January, Chief Justice Cheung said that not all trials, especially those involving a jury and vulnerable witnesses, would be suitable for live broadcasting, and suggested beginning with appellate proceedings, particularly those at the Court of Final Appeal.

But he warned that the judiciary should also consider possible misuse of broadcast trials or doxxing of judges and legal representatives.

Britain allowed cameras in a criminal trial for the first time in England and Wales in July last year, when a manslaughter case was televised.

Filming was limited to the sentencing, with only the judge appearing on camera. The British government said the move would give the public a greater understanding of the judicial process.Hong Kong judges try out AI to speed up transcribing as lawyers see its potential

Bar Association chairman Victor Dawes told the Post that he supported the judiciary’s move to further adopt technology.

“From a logistical point of view, appeal hearing may be more suitable for trial runs but the judiciary will have a better understanding on logistical issues,” he said.

Senior counsel Ronny Tong Ka-wah welcomed the move, describing it as a “good step forward”.

He suggested starting with simple criminal and civil cases without sensitive information, expressing confidence that existing restrictions would be enough to prevent footage misuse.

“As cases are open hearings anyway, the usual sanctions as to deliberate misreporting should apply. If need be, there should be clear legislative guidelines issued,” Tong said.

Separately, the judiciary said it would consult the legal profession and other court users at the end of the year on the mandatory use of its electronic case management system, inviting the profession and litigants to contribute their views on a suitable timetable, legislative amendments, exemptions and support needed to make the electronic system a default in the city’s proceedings.

Since last year, e-filing of legal papers has been allowed at the District Court for personal injury cases, tax claims, civil action and employees’ compensation cases, and simple cases at the Magistrates’ Courts involving summonses.

Law firms and litigants must be registered on the electronic case management system to file legal documents and make payments online, instead of using over-the-counter services at city courts.Courting technology: why some Hong Kong lawyers are slow to go paperless

The judiciary administrator added that by the end of October, 350 court users, including 283 law firms, registered accounts under the electronic system, a sharp increase from 43 law firms reported in February.

The system also handled 24.2 per cent of eligible cases between last May and October this year, according to the judiciary.

Starting next year, the judiciary will “incrementally” roll out the electronic system to the Court of Final Appeal, the High Court, non-summons cases at Magistrates’ Courts and the Small Claims Tribunal.","{'uri': 'scmp.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'South China Morning Post'}",[],https://cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/d8/images/canvas/2023/11/21/d19e7d02-c5eb-4b30-aeac-c6cba5c53be4_51431bc2.jpg?itok=OwiUt10y,,0.3411764705882352,25,25,South China Morning Post,scmp.com

Beginning a legal challenge to the Northern Ireland Troubles (Legacy and Reconciliation) Act at Belfast High Court, barrister John Larkin KC also said that a new commission which will take over thousands of unsolved deaths would be the ""only show in town"" for victims but that its architecture was ""inadequate"" and ""defective"".

The Act received royal assent in September despite widespread opposition from political parties, victims' organisations in Northern Ireland and the Irish government.

Aspects of the laws include a limited form of immunity from prosecution for Troubles-related offences for those who co-operate with the new Independent Commission for Reconciliation and Information Recovery (ICRIR).

The new Act will also halt future civil cases and legacy inquests.

The legal challenge, being brought by a number of Troubles victims and heard by Mr Justice Colton, argues that the Act does not comply with human rights law.

Opening the proceedings, Mr Larkin read from the affidavits of a number of Troubles victims whose cases are being heard jointly.

These included the affidavit of Martina Dillon, whose husband Seamus was shot dead in Dungannon in 1997.

The barrister said Mrs Dillon's grief in losing her husband was as raw today as the night he was killed.

Her affidavit said that suspected perpetrators ""can safely sleep at night knowing they will never be held accountable"" as long as the Legacy Act exists.

Mr Larkin said the Troubles had left an ""enormous collective pain"".

He added: ""A pain created by individual events but a pain that is now subject to a form of secondary traumatisation through the provisions in this Act.""

Turning to the individual provisions of the Act, Mr Larkin said if the ICRIR had been created alongside existing structures there might be little to condemn it.

He added: ""But it is the fact that this is an exclusive body, inadequate in its capacities, which extinguishes existing rights, that however imperfectly have been use in an attempt to secure truth and justice.""

The barrister described references in the Act that the ICRIR would promote reconciliation as a form of ""meretricious window dressing"".

He added: ""If the commission stood alone there might well be complaints one might make about it if one had the faculty of going to the commission instead of seeking an inquest or bringing civil proceedings or criminal proceedings.

""But the commission is the only show in town and it is a defective show, and other shows which have been established to have worked well in the past are closed down.""

Turning to the immunity provisions of the Act, Mr Larkin said the powers would go beyond any immunity powers granted to a public inquiry.

He said: ""All that is required is a truthful, incriminating account.

""There does not have to be any expression, sincere or otherwise of remorse, there does not have to be any acknowledgement of wrongdoing in a moral sense and the account can be accompanied by triumphalism, crowing, by glorification of the criminal act.

""The panel does not have any discretion, any rule for withholding immunity once conditions are met.

""In the context of a measure which is badged as promoting reconciliation, we say the structure for immunity is fundamentally antithetical to any proper approach to reconciliation and actively harms reconciliation.""

Mr Larkin said the Act did not address the suffering of victims, but instead shut it down.

Speaking before the case started, Mrs Dillon said she hoped the courts would listen to the voices of victims.

She said: ""I am here today to fight for my husband Seamus Dillon and for each and every other victim that needs this law to be changed, and for the courts to please listen and help us.""

""I shouldn't have to be here today to go and fight for truth and justice which I believe I am entitled to.""

Amnesty International, which is supporting the legal challenge, called on the Irish Government to proceed with an inter-state legal case against the legacy laws.

Grainne Teggart said: ""Today's case is hugely significant, not only for the victims challenging this law, but for every Troubles victim having truth and justice cruelly denied to them.

""We repeatedly warned the UK Government during the passage of this legislation that if they pushed this through to law, we would see them in court.

""That is what we are doing here today. Today is day one in the fightback against this law which prioritises perpetrators at the expense of victims' rights.""

She added: ""We call on the Irish Government to swiftly make a decision to take an inter-state case. It is not right that the burden of legal challenge falls solely on the shoulders of victims.

""We note that Leo Varadkar has said in recent days that a decision will be imminent in the coming weeks. We call on them to follow through with their opposition to this law and take that case.""

The hearing, which is expected to last at least five days, continues.","{'uri': 'independent.co.uk', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'The Independent'}",[],https://static.independent.co.uk/2023/11/21/12/3a28ae30bc446560f4b751919cb73f1bY29udGVudHNlYXJjaGFwaSwxNzAwNjU0OTE1-2.74625959.jpg?quality=75&width=1200&auto=webp,eng-9079554,-0.403921568627451,25,25,The Independent,independent.co.uk

Janet Mills and Attorney General Aaron Frey have tasked the commission with performing a review of the events leading up to the Lewiston shootings and the response to it. Army reservist Robert Card, 40, killed 18 people in a bowling alley and a restaurant on Oct. 25 before dying of a self-inflicted gunshot wound.

The commission held its first meeting on Monday and members unanimously voted to request subpoena power from the Maine Legislature.

""We will be seeking military records, and those might not be accessible to us without subpoena power,"" said Toby Dilworth, a former assistant U.S. attorney for the District of Maine and a commission member. ""It's essential that we have this subpoena power.""

The commission is chaired by Daniel Wathen, former chief justice of the Maine Supreme Judicial Court. Other members include Debra Baeder, the former chief forensic psychologist for the state, and Paula Silsby, a former U.S. attorney for the District of Maine.

The panel is expected to investigate potential missed opportunities to prevent the shootings. Card was well known to law enforcement and fellow service members had raised flags about his behavior, mental health state and potential for violence before the shootings. Card spent two weeks in a psychiatric hospital in New York last summer after an altercation with other reserve members.

Mills and Frey swiftly released a statement that they supported the move to use subpoena power. Mills, who created the commission via executive order, has called on the commission to follow the facts of the case and keep them as transparent to the public as possible.

Mills and Frey said in their statement they would ""immediately begin consulting with the Independent Commission and legislative leadership to prepare legislation granting the commission the power of subpoena, with the goal of having that legislation prepared for the Legislature's consideration at the beginning of the next session.""

The commission will meet again on Dec. 14, Wathen said. He said his goal was for the commission to produce a written report within six months, which was a timeline he called ""a very ambitious goal, but highly desirable for obvious reasons.""

The commission also took comments from the public on Monday. Rep. Suzanne Salisbury, a Westbrook Democrat, called on the commission to collaborate with law enforcement as it performs its review.

""I hope that law enforcement's voice can be heard and used as the experts they are,"" Salisbury said.","{'uri': 'nbcnews.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'NBC News'}",[],"https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_nbcnews-fp-1024-512,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2023-11/231120-maine-shooting-subpeona-kh-92a6f8.jpg",eng-9078000,-0.01960784313725494,25,25,NBC News,nbcnews.com

Former President Donald Trump is about to learn once again that the First Amendment, while sweeping in its protections of speech from government interference, isn't absolute. Based on arguments at the Washington, D.C., Circuit Court of Appeals on Monday, it seems likely that the appellate court will at least partially reimpose a gag order against Trump in the federal election interference case. While the order would limit what Trump can say, it would allow others to speak the truth.

Last month, District Judge Tanya Chutkan imposed a limited gag order against the former president, which prohibited him from disparaging the court staff, the special prosecutor and his staff and likely future witnesses. The order was far narrower in scope than the one requested by prosecutors: Chutkan declined to include statements that Trump may make about Washington, the Justice Department in general, the federal government more broadly or the judge herself.

Chutkan's order struck a delicate balance between the First Amendment rights of a political candidate and the need to protect the administration of justice. As Chutkan noted, Trump's ""presidential candidacy does not give him carte blanche to vilify and implicitly encourage violence against public servants who are simply doing their job.""

Trump appealed the order, and the circuit court put it on hold while it considers the case. On Monday, a three-judge panel of appellate judges heard arguments about the gag order -- and it didn't go well for Trump. The judges appear very likely to uphold the order, while potentially limiting its scope.

Trump and his team focused on his speech rights and incorrectly asserted that, unlike every other person in this country, the former president possesses an ""absolute freedom"" to say what he wishes. This freedom, they argued, holds no matter how much he threatens court staff members, prosecutors or potential witnesses. The prosecution, understandably, focused on the need to protect the administration of justice broadly and those court employees, special counsel Jack Smith and his staff and possible witnesses.

Trump's arguments, if accepted by the court, would essentially mean that a court would at least have to wait until there has been documented witness intimidation before imposing a gag order. Such a standard can't be and isn't the law. While we have never had a case exactly like this one, gag orders aren't per se unconstitutional, and they are allowed when circumstances justify them, such as to prevent harassment of witnesses, prejudice of the jury or the publication of trade secrets or other confidential information.

While Trump and his supporters frame the gag order as silencing one man, this gag order would actually allow far more people to speak.

It is true that we have never seen a gag order like the one in this case. But we have never elected a president who sought to undermine the peaceful transfer of power and, allegedly, engage in crimes to do so. We have never had a former president who called prosecutors a ""team of thugs."" We have never had a former president-turned-criminal defendant with an apparent history of testing the line when it comes to witness tampering.

When Trump, the criminal defendant, and yes, the political candidate, speaks, he attempts to silence others. A limited gag order would still allow him to vigorously defend himself in the legal and political spheres, yet crucially it would protect those who are called to testify. Trump is entitled to speak, and the public has the right to listen. But in a criminal case, his speech can -- and must -- be balanced against the public's right to the fair administration of justice, which includes the ability of witnesses to testify free of threats and intimidation.

Gag orders should be narrowly tailored and imposed as a last resort, when they are basically the only way to allow the legal system to function fairly. Trump isn't wrong in saying that when a gag order is placed on a political candidate, we need to tread carefully. Political speech stands at the apex of protected speech. And political speech targeted at government officials is just the type of speech the government would want to censor.

But Trump is wrong in saying that there is only one side of the scale to consider. Our democracy depends on the quaint idea that the rule of law still exists. The criminal justice system will crater if bullies can hide behind the First Amendment and intimidate those who keep the system working -- court staff members and prosecutors. Similarly, criminal trials will become farces if defendants can merely intimidate witnesses into silence.

Limiting Trump's speech is not just consistent with decades of judicial precedents. It is essential for this case to proceed in a timely and fair fashion. Only with a narrowly tailored gag order can Americans be confident that the eventual verdict, however the jury decides, will reflect the rule of law.","{'uri': 'msnbc.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'MSNBC.com'}",[],"https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_nbcnews-fp-1024-512,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2023-11/231120-donald-trump-se-125p-3fed37.jpg",eng-9078152,0.01960784313725483,25,25,MSNBC.com,msnbc.com

Officials in Strasbourg are investigating a suspected meteorite strike, after a parked car was found with a 50-centimetre diameter hole in its roof.

The fire department were called out early on Monday morning to reports of smoke coming from a car which was parked in a suburb of the city in north-east France.

""Following reconnaissance by the first team, we suspect the fall of a stellar body,"" wrote the Bas-Rhin Sdis, the regional fire department, in its intervention report published mid-day.

""When we arrived, we noticed a relatively large impact, around 50 centimetres in diameter, which had gone through the roof, underbody and fuel tank of the vehicle"", fire department captain Matthieu Colobert told AFP.

A search concluded that there was no radioactivity.

""No object was found,"" he continued. ""Either the object was so small that we can't find it, or the impact was such that the object disintegrated and turned to dust"", he suggested.

Colobert said his team does have a ""suspicion"" about a gravel stone which is around two centimetres wide, which was found at the scene. It has been handed to police for further analysis.

A police spokesman told AFP: ""It's about the size of a hazelnut, looks like burnt wood, very light."" He announced that the object would be sent to Paris to a forensics department.

Second District Judge John Judge in Moscow, Idaho, said the court would, however, operate a livestream, available on its YouTube channel, that would ensure members of the public can observe the proceedings.

Bryan Kohberger is charged with four counts of murder in connection with the deaths at a rental house near the university campus in Moscow last November. A judge entered a not-guilty plea on Kohberger's behalf earlier this year. Latah County Prosecutor Bill Thompson has said he intends to seek the death penalty, and the case is scheduled for trial this fall, although it could be postponed.

The judge had been allowing news cameras in the courtroom during hearings under strict conditions, but on Friday, he granted a request by Kohberger's attorneys to ban them. Judge wrote that some photographic and video coverage had zoomed in on Kohberger, despite his directive that shots show the entire courtroom, and that some shots depicted him entering or exiting the courtroom, despite orders that images only be taken when court is on the record and not in recess.

""It is the intense focus on Kohberger and his every move, along with adverse headlines and news articles, that leads the Court to conclude that continued photograph and video coverage inside the courtroom by the media should no longer be permitted,"" Judge wrote.

Wendy Olson, an attorney representing a coalition of media organizations, including The Associated Press, which sought to preserve their ability to take photos and video during hearings in the case, did not immediately respond to an email and phone call seeking comment Monday evening.

The bodies of Madison Mogen, Kaylee Goncalves, Xana Kernodle and Ethan Chapin were found Nov. 13, 2022, at a home across the street from the University of Idaho campus. Investigators pieced together DNA evidence, cellphone data and surveillance video that they say links Kohberger to the slayings.

According to the affidavit, Kohberger's cellphone pinged in the vicinity of the house 12 times prior to the murders. Steve Goncalves, Kaylee's father, told ""48 Hours"" in September that before the gag order, one of the lead investigators told him they believe Kohberger had been scouting out the house.

""He had to know when people were coming, people were going,"" Steve Goncalves said.

Kohberger was a graduate student studying criminology at Washington State University, which is a short drive from the scene of the killings across the state border. He was arrested at his parents' home in Pennsylvania, and the unusual details of the case have drawn widespread interest.

Judge said his order, which cannot be appealed, would balance the public's interest with Kohberger's right to a fair trial and the orderly administration of justice, because the court would not have to monitor who was recording images of what.

""To be clear, the Court is not accusing all journalists and media outlets of violating the Court's orders,"" he wrote. ""However, Court operated video system will give the Court greater control over what is being videoed, will lessen the burden on the bailiffs, will help to alleviate counsels' concerns, and will allow the media and the public access to the video footage of the proceedings.""

Last month, the judge rejected a motion to throw out Kohberger's indictment.

Kohberger's lawyers had argued his indictment should be thrown out on the grounds of ""error in grand jury instructions,"" CBS affiliate KREM reported.

Kohberger's defense took particular issue with the burden of proof being established to the jury as ""probable cause"" instead of ""beyond a reasonable doubt,"" which it argued was not standard in the state of Idaho, KREM reported.","{'uri': 'cbsnews.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'CBS News'}",[],https://assets2.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2023/01/05/b50fe43f-dd6e-42ab-9805-a2d170032ff6/thumbnail/1200x630/c85ca77c573aa42e08758e85f552eb2f/hypatia-h-7684bae553386d54659e1c8803486a58-h-762df0713e16ad419212a71292d3cd19.jpg?v=5659e73acd91751548aa89950cf015b0,eng-9078341,-0.3254901960784313,25,25,CBS News,cbsnews.com

Wisconsin's supreme court will hear oral argument on Tuesday in a high-stakes lawsuit seeking to strike down the maps for the state's legislature. The result could bring an end to what may be the most gerrymandered districts in the United States and upend politics in Wisconsin.

The case, Clarke v Wisconsin Elections Commission, could bring an end to more than a decade of Republican dominance in the Wisconsin legislature. In 2011, Republicans drew districts for the state legislature that were so distorted in their favor that it made it impossible for them to lose their majorities. Last year, the state supreme court implemented new maps that made as little change as possible from the old ones when lawmakers and the state's Democratic governor reached a redistricting impasse.

The map for Wisconsin's state assembly may be the most gerrymandered body in the US. It packs Democrats into as few districts as possible while splitting their influence elsewhere. Even though Wisconsin is one of America's most politically competitive states, Republicans have never held fewer than 60 seats in the state assembly since 2012. The gerrymandering in the assembly carries over to the state senate, where Wisconsin law requires districts to be comprised of three assembly districts.

The case was filed the day after Janet Protasiewicz formally took her seat on the supreme court in August, flipping control of the bench and giving liberals a 4-3 majority. Protasiewicz, who called the maps ""rigged"" during her campaign last year, a comment that has prompted Republicans in the legislature to threaten impeaching her.

The challengers in the case argue that the maps are unconstitutional for two reasons. First, they say, 75 of the state's 132 legislative districts are non-contiguous. That is a clear violation of a mandate in the state's constitution that says districts have to ""be bounded by county, precinct, town or ward lines, to consist of contiguous territory and be in as compact form as practicable"".

Second, they argue that the way the maps came to be implemented ran afoul of the state constitution. In 2021, the state supreme court took over the redistricting process after Governor Tony Evers, a Democrat, vetoed a GOP-drawn plan. The court, which then had a conservative majority, invited a range of submissions for a new map, but announced it would pick a proposal that made as little change as possible to the existing maps. It initially chose a plan drawn by Evers, but that map was rejected by the US supreme court. The state supreme court then chose a different plan submitted by legislative Republicans. It was the same map Evers had vetoed in 2021.

That decision, the challengers argue, allowed the legislature to essentially override Evers's veto, the challengers say, violating the separation of powers between governmental branches.

Republicans argue that the districts are constitutional. Several localities in Wisconsin have annexed non-contiguous territories so to keep localities whole. The state supreme court also exercised a constitutionally permissible role in choosing a map, they say, because the governor and lawmakers had reached an impasse.

The state elections commission has said that it would need any maps to be in place for next year's elections no later than 15 March 2024 so a decision from the supreme court is expected relatively quickly.","{'uri': 'theguardian.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","[{'uri': 'sam_levine@theguardian.com', 'name': 'Sam Levine', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': False}]",https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f2ffc41cd353d349aa6d1c360e18d99882a9718b/0_140_3648_2189/master/3648.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&s=b3c3430e80d8a2952d4c6c6ed9fb71ba,eng-9078388,0.1372549019607843,25,25,The Guardian,theguardian.com

County fire foundation collected donations despite fundraising ban,"Los Angeles County Supervisor Janice Hahn has called for an investigation into the Los Angeles County Fire Department Foundation after learning that the charity, created to financially support the county Fire Department, may have collected donations months after the state barred it from fundraising.

On March 10, the California Department of Justice, which regulates charities, informed the foundation by mail that it had not submitted a routine annual financial form for 2021. Four months later, the department sent another letter informing the foundation that it was now considered ""delinquent,"" meaning it could not raise funds or dole out donations, per state regulations.

The nonprofit, which has its own volunteer board of directors, was formed in 2016 to support the Fire Department, hosting ceremonies for agency personnel and buying equipment. The foundation's website asks for donations for wildfire support, mechanical CPR devices and new ropes, among other needs.

""Your donations save lives that taxes cannot,"" the website reads.

Hahn in a statement she was ""outraged and disappointed"" that the foundation kept taking in these donations months after being notified by the state it was behind on its paperwork.

""Whether it was malicious or accidental, there is no excuse for jeopardizing this organization that has become so important to our firefighters or for misleading donors who thought they were contributing to a nonprofit in good standing,"" she said. ""I am calling for a full investigation into exactly what happened and why it took so long for the fire chief and the Board of Supervisors to be told.""

Stacy Mungo Flanigan, the foundation's president, said she did not know until last month that the organization was delinquent.

Flanigan said she received the March letter from the Department of Justice informing the foundation it was missing paperwork only in mid-October when it showed up in her mailbox -- already opened. She said the mailbox is located at the county Fire Department headquarters, and she checks it only about once a month.

""The moral of the story is, I didn't know,"" she said. ""The moment I knew we were delinquent, we took it seriously.""

The Department of Justice sent out additional letters to the foundation on July 21 and Sept. 29, informing it of its delinquent status and warning that it could lose its tax-exempt status if the proper paperwork wasn't filed. Flanigan said she never received either of those letters.

At Tuesday's Board of Supervisors meeting, Hahn plans to ask her colleagues to join her in a motion that asks the county's lawyers to investigate the foundation and find out if ""any deliberate or unintentional wrongdoing has occurred."" The motion also asks for an audit of the money the charity has received and spent since it was formed in the spring of 2016.

Flanigan said the foundation plays a critical role for the department. Since 2019, she said, it has given roughly $5 million to the department for items including Pelotons, jaws of life, refrigerators and mechanical CPR devices.

She also noted multiple charitable organizations that support county employees have, at one point, been placed on delinquent status by the Department of Justice.

After the March letter turned up this fall, she said she immediately sent the missing paperwork to the Department of Justice and expects the foundation to be back in good standing, though it is unclear when. She said she was told it could take up to three months for the state agency to process the documents.

Fire Chief Anthony Marrone said the department will ""fully cooperate"" with an investigation into the foundation.

On Wednesday, Marrone told the foundation's board of directors in a letter that the department would stop taking donations from the foundation. He also ordered the foundation to remove the department ""name, likeness and logo"" from its website and postpone an upcoming celebration it had planned in honor of the department's 100th anniversary.

The same day, he sent out a memo barring staff from requesting donations from the foundation and buying items from the foundation store, which sells T-shirts, keychains and pins.

Flanigan said Marrone's decision has ground the foundation's gift-giving to a halt.

She will stop paying the cellphone bills for the 585 iPads the foundation bought for firefighters, and is now storing 36 washers and dryers meant for the county's fire stations.","{'uri': 'latimes.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'Los Angeles Times'}",[],https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/c7ac484/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6258x3520+0+326/resize/1200x675!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F19%2F35%2Ff8240e5d40bc91370878be616188%2F1170750-me-0819-vanessa-bryant-trial-003-ik.jpg,,0.1607843137254903,25,25,Los Angeles Times,latimes.com

The Independent Workers Union of Great Britain (IWGB) had tried to represent a group of Deliveroo riders in order to negotiate pay and conditions with the company.

The union was first refused permission in 2017 on the basis that riders were not ""workers"" under UK labour law and it has since mounted a number of appeals.

The IWGB took its case to the UK's highest court in April, arguing that it was an unlawful interference with riders' human rights to deny the IWGB's application to be recognised by Deliveroo for collective bargaining.

But the Supreme Court unanimously dismissed the IWGB's appeal in a ruling on Tuesday.

Donald Trump's legal team was in federal court in Washington, DC on Monday for oral arguments concerning the partial gag order imposed on the former president in his federal election interference case.

Judge Tanya Chutkan ruled that Mr Trump cannot make ""disparaging or ""inflammatory"" comments about people or entities involved in the case brought by Special Counsel Jack Smith.

Mr Trump's team argued that as he is running for president any restrictions on what he can say while he campaigns would violate his right to free speech.

A panel of judges didn't appear to buy that argument, but an official ruling is yet to be made.

Meanwhile, the former president's civil fraud trial in New York enters its eighth week. In that trial, Mr Trump's attorneys won a pause on the gag order imposed on him there.

Over the weekend, Mr Trump visited the US-Mexico border in Texas, where Republican Governor Greg Abbott endorsed his 2024 White House run.

Mr Trump served food to members of the National Guard and others stationed at the border for the upcoming Thanksgiving holiday before a rally of his supporters.","{'uri': 'independent.co.uk', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'The Independent'}",[],https://static.independent.co.uk/2023/11/19/14/1790164195.jpg?quality=75&width=1200&auto=webp,,-0.01960784313725494,25,25,The Independent,independent.co.uk

The British government's aggressive politicisation of human rights is a dangerous assault on democracy that must be halted before irrevocable damage is done, the UK director of Human Rights Watch (HRW) has warned.

In an exclusive interview with the Guardian, Yasmine Ahmed, who has been the UK director of HRW since November 2020, said the government indicating it could ""disapply"" the Human Rights Act to an emergency bill that will allow it to send asylum seekers to Rwanda - despite the supreme court ruling the policy illegal - is part of an escalating attack on human rights.

""With previous governments there was always an attempt to at least try to appear as if they were comply ing with domestic or international human rights law and to respect the courts and human rights institutions,"" Ahmed said. ""Now there is no attempt to do this - in fact, it's quite the opposite.""

She continued: ""Rishi Sunak's government must know that even scrapping the Human Rights Act will not prevent it from facing significant legal barriers to its Rwanda policy, but what we're seeing is the UK moving towards a place where the government feels it can undermine the integrity of the judiciary, undermine or scrap human rights laws that don't serve its current political agenda, and create new laws that do. This is a dangerous place to find ourselves in. This can start to look very much like authoritarianism.""

Ahmed says that since she took up the UK directorship of Human Rights Watch three years ago, the government has launched an unprecedented attack on human rights enshrined in British and international law.

""Not only is the government talking about ripping up domestic human rights law and ignoring its international obligations, it has launched an open attack on the right to peacefully demonstrate, is locking up climate protesters, criminalising refugees and has given the police unprecedented powers over citizens,"" Ahmed said.

""This approach not only discredits and undermines our ability to hold other human rights violators to account on the international stage, but it creates a model of governance that puts political ideology over a state's legal obligation to uphold basic human rights that were put into law to protect us all. Once you attack, discredit and tear up these laws and frameworks it could be almost impossible to put them back together.""

She says that in recent weeks, attempts to stop pro-Palestinian protests "" by the former home secretary Suella Braverman and the government's attacks on the supreme court's ruling that its Rwanda asylum policy is illegal shows how emboldened the state has become in showing contempt for human rights.

""They have been successful in making us believe that ripping up human rights laws and putting new ones in place will only affect vulnerable and controversial groups,"" she said. ""But all of us, at any time, may need to exercise our rights or hold the state to account and suddenly discover that we have lost the power to do so.""","{'uri': 'theguardian.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","[{'uri': 'annie_kelly@theguardian.com', 'name': 'Annie Kelly', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': False}]",https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8185c8ace4dcd823c882792b45182b6e6ec1904b/0_60_4300_2580/master/4300.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&s=28a4be7a54c6d3f89e77ea9245333d6d,,-0.3019607843137255,25,25,The Guardian,theguardian.com

The bill is the third attempt to cure a long-running legal defect in the powers of the Australian Criminal Intelligence Commission to conduct special investigations and operations.

The bill, which was introduced on Tuesday and passed the Senate on Friday, was cited by the opposition leader, Peter Dutton, as an example of bipartisan cooperation during fierce political arguments on the unrelated issue of releases from indefinite detention.

But Greens senator David Shoebridge told the Senate the ""only credible"" explanation for the bill's urgency is if a decade's worth of ""covert warrants and surveillance is likely to have been found to be unlawful and therefore won't stand up in court"".

The designation of an investigation as ""special"" enlivens the ACIC's coercive powers to force people to produce documents or items or submit to an examination, with penalties of up to five years in prison for failure to attend and answer questions.

The focus of such investigations includes high-risk criminal targets, outlawed motorcycle gangs, criminal exploitation of the migration system, firearms trafficking, ""high risk and emerging drugs"", and national security impacts from serious and organised crime.

In December 2019 the home affairs minister, Peter Dutton, convinced Labor to support an urgent bill to retrospectively validate ACIC special investigations, over fears one target was set to win a high court case against the extraordinary powers.

In November 2022, the Albanese government passed a second bill to ""provide greater certainty"" about the ACIC board's powers to authorise special operations and investigations.

In the House of Representatives the Greens leader, Adam Bandt, said that passing retrospective legislation was ""very serious"" and queried ""has a government agency been acting in a way that is potentially unlawful"".

The attorney general, Mark Dreyfus, said the bill ensures the ACIC ""can continue to undertake its vital statutory function to combat serious and organised crime in Australia and keep the Australian community safe"".

Amendments for ""vital statutory functions"" were ""standard practice"", he said in reply to Bandt.

In the Senate, Shoebridge said the bill appeared designed ""to protect past illegal activities by these agencies, because there is no other explanation for the rush"".

""The only credible urgency is that they know the activities were illegal, and they've probably been illegal for a decade, and a whole bunch of covert warrants and surveillance is likely to have been found to be unlawful and therefore won't stand up in court,"" he said.

According to the ACIC's 2022-23 annual report, in March 2023 it withdrew a summons for a person to appear before an ACIC examiner when the person, known by the pseudonym DCL22, raised ""constitutional grounds"" in a full federal court appeal.

In February 2023 high court proceedings in a separate case were discontinued by consent, after a plaintiff known as JAM ""raised constitutional issues"" relating to charges that appeared on his AFP-issued police check.

In September 2020 Guardian Australia revealed several other instances of the ACIC quietly settling cases or withdrawing notices when the legality of its powers was challenged.

A spokesperson for Dreyfus told Guardian Australia that ""consistent with the practice of successive governments, it is necessary for the government to take steps to ensure that agencies can continue to discharge their core functions"". ""This bill does not expand ACIC's powers.""

On 14 November, Dutton said that the Coalition would support the bill ""in relation to an issue around"" the ACIC.

""Those bills pop up all the time to address quirky outcomes that the courts provide for, decisions that we can't really agree with or understand, but you can patch it up with a change to the law,"" Dutton told 2GB Radio.

The shadow attorney general, Michaelia Cash, told the Senate the bill follows ""changes commenced under the former Coalition government and continued by Labor in government"".

She said it would ""preserve the status quo and ensure that there is no legal doubt about decision-making processes undertaken by the ACIC so it can continue to combat serious and organised crime"".

In a statement on Tuesday, an ACIC spokesperson said: ""The Australian Criminal Intelligence Commission (ACIC) takes its legal and compliance responsibilities seriously.

""The ACIC does not comment publicly regarding exchanges of intelligence and information with its partner agencies. This is especially the case for matters that may be before the courts.""","{'uri': 'theguardian.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","[{'uri': 'paul_karp@theguardian.com', 'name': 'Paul Karp', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': False}]",https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/dd53da76e676a6de0eee34e42c936f4fd1420b95/0_98_4455_2673/master/4455.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&s=bcf03ff4ce3fbfb96cf5c557359d981c,,-0.1215686274509804,25,25,The Guardian,theguardian.com

Today's hot trend for policymakers is talking about artificial intelligence. This incredibly powerful technology is here to stay, and new research shows that most of us are optimistic about how generative AI will be able to improve our lives.

But there are some new and concerning threats to which policymakers must pay attention. This includes a horrific misuse of this positive tech: bad actors abusing AI to put real people in sexually explicit situations, including minors.

This criminal use of AI tools is not just reprehensible; it could destroy a person's life and dignity. There is currently a gap in the law addressing such conduct that may allow bad actors to go free, and policymakers need to address it now to ensure the culprits can be appropriately held to account.

Hundreds of laws already make illegal many of the ways bad actors can abuse AI tools. If AI is used to commit fraud, we have laws against fraud. The same is true for using AI for illegal discrimination, and the list goes on.

WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)?

Every existing law applies to AI like it does to its offline corollaries. But gaps do exist, and Americans are getting hurt.

One such gap remains when it comes to prosecuting predators handling sexually explicit images of minors. Today's laws require such images to be real, live-shot photos. But abusers are using AI tools to escape justice by claiming in court that since the sexually explicit image of a real minor is ""created by AI,"" it's not ""real,"" and thus not criminal. Unfortunately, the existing letter of the law is letting abusers escape the purposes of the law.

At the same time, other bad actors leverage AI to generate ""deepfakes"" of innocent parties in compromising, sexually explicit positions. Think of this as a modern day photoshopping of a person's head on another's body - except now, the fake is more difficult to distinguish.

Once again, the laws on this are murky at best. Harassment and defamation of character are existing ways to prosecute an offender, but since this is ""AI"" and not a real photo, a legal gap exists that must be filled.

GOP LAWMAKERS SOUND ALARM OVER AI USED TO SEXUALLY EXPLOIT CHILDREN

These holes in our laws could provide a dangerous haven for criminals, allowing them to hide behind the letter of the law while eviscerating its spirit. Thus, legislative attention is warranted and urgently needed. Lawmakers should act, not to ban or overregulate AI with a Red Tape Wishlist, but to patch these holes in our existing laws to ensure criminals can't work around them to abuse innocent people.

The first step for policymakers is to enact the Stop Deepfake CSAM Act. This simple bill updates existing child protection laws to make clear that it's illegal if a criminal uses AI to ""modify"" sexual images of children. If they are using a real child in it, even if the rest is AI generated, this is child pornography. It is illegal, and policymakers must ensure these predators go to prison.

Next is to approve the Stop Non-Consensual Distribution of Intimate Deepfake Media Act. This updates existing state privacy laws to make it clear that it is illegal to distribute AI images of an identifiable person with the intent to cause harm - addressing serious concerns about the horrific harassment of ""deepfakes.""

These changes empower law enforcement to punish bad actors using AI for nefarious purposes. This isn't to say that just making something illegal will stop it, but this is a positive step to getting recompense for harmed parties.

The pursuit of justice in the digital age must be dynamic and recognize the new dimensions AI introduces into criminal activity. This isn't merely a legislative update; it's a moral imperative.

The government must hold those who weaponize tools, including AI, against us accountable, which ensures that the digital world is an extension of our commitment to dignity, safety and justice.

The long-awaited review, released on Tuesday by attorney general, Mark Dreyfus, would also require ministerial consent to prosecute journalists who publish stories in the public interest. The proposal would also remove criminal liability from hundreds of offences.

The Human Rights Law Centre welcomed aspects of the overhaul but suggested that a proposed general secrecy law went ""too far"". It implored the attorney general to ""strike the right balance between secrecy and transparency in our democracy after a decade of opacity"".

The new catch-all provision is envisioned to address the ""gap"" exposed by the recent confidentiality breach scandal by consulting giant PwC .

Dreyfus ordered a review in December last year of the ""number, inconsistency, appropriateness and complexity of commonwealth secrecy offences"".

The number of secrecy offences had increased from 506 in 2009 to 875 in late 2022 when the Australian Law Reform Commission (ALRC) issued a report that concluded many of these offences were at odds with the then-Labor government's commitment to ""open and accountable government"".

The attorney general's department review recommends criminal liability be stripped from 168 of the 875 offences, with a further reduction expected after the introduction of the new general secrecy law.

It will also capture officials who expose ""sensitive information"" that affects the effective working of government and is considered to undermine public trust in government.

The ALRC's report did not consider ""prejudice to the effective working of government"" a strong enough reason for criminal offences but the department's review disagreed, saying it was appropriate to be captured.

The review, however, noted ""embarrassment to government"" was not a sufficient reason to pursue for criminal offences against an official.

While a general public interest case was not included in the review to avoid duplication with public interest disclosure laws, stronger rules will be introduced around public interest journalism.

Dreyfus said the Albanese government believed a ""strong and independent media is vital to democracy and holding governments to account"".

""Journalists should never face the prospect of being charged or even gaoled just for doing their jobs,"" Dreyfus said.

Kieran Pender, a senior lawyer at HRLC, said the government's commitment to press freedom and whistleblower protections was welcome but its proposed general secrecy offences went ""too far"" and were contrary to the ALRC's earlier recommendation.

Jail time for some offences was increased under the Coalition and Pender said these changes should have been reversed by the current government.

""The government's review has also refused to recalibrate secrecy offences that apply to all Australians, not just public servants, and ignores calls for a general public interest defence,"" he said.

""The government should not waste this opportunity to robustly protect transparency and press freedom, which are cornerstones of our democracy.""

The review's release follows last week's trial of army whistleblower David McBride, who pleaded guilty on Friday afternoon to three charges after the ACT supreme court upheld a commonwealth intervention to withhold key evidence.

McBride, a former military lawyer, pleaded guilty to stealing commonwealth information and giving it to journalists at the Australian Broadcasting Corporation.

The ABC subsequently used the material as the basis for an investigative series exposing war crimes in Afghanistan titled The Afghan Files.

McBride had earlier unsuccessfully attempted to use existing public interest disclosure protections to avoid prosecution but his lawyers abandoned the bid after the commonwealth moved to suppress expert evidence.

The tax office whistleblower Richard Boyle similarly attempted to use the whistleblower protections earlier this year but a South Australian judge ruled they did not cover his alleged actions.

Boyle is facing 24 charges - which he says stem from trying to collect evidence for a public interest disclosure - including taping private conversations without consent and taking photos of taxpayer information.

Last Thursday, the federal government published a discussion paper on further changes to whistleblower protections it will consider as part of its second tranche of reforms.

The proposed changes include determining whether whistleblowers should be protected for gathering evidence before disclosing possible wrongdoing.

The need for a standalone whistleblower protection authority, and a financial reward system for those coming forward, will also be considered before the end of the year.","{'uri': 'theguardian.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","[{'uri': 'sarah_basford_canales@theguardian.com', 'name': 'Sarah Basford Canales', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': False}]",https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/db01e9466afbcde498678d1a65a016b62755e7d1/888_1102_4870_2922/master/4870.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&s=e622b7555acf8494b9e134bbee5e61de,eng-9079195,-0.1529411764705882,25,25,The Guardian,theguardian.com

Three judges on the Manhattan-based 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals panel heard the professors' appeal of a ruling dismissing their claim that having an exclusive union representative, regardless of whether or not they become union members, violates their free-speech rights under the First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution.

New York and most other states have laws requiring that one union exclusively represent groups of public employees. The U.S. Supreme Court in the 1984 case Minnesota State Board for Community Colleges v. Knight upheld a Minnesota law barring anyone other than an exclusive union representative from participating in bargaining sessions.

Six City University of New York (CUNY) professors, five of whom are Jewish, sued the CUNY system and the Professional Staff Congress (PSC) last year after the union adopted a resolution condemning ""the continued subjection of Palestinians to the state-supported displacement, occupation, and use of lethal force by Israel."" The professors said they viewed the resolution as antisemitic.

U.S. District Judge Paul Engelmayer in Manhattan dismissed the case in March, saying the professors' free-speech claims were precluded by the Knight ruling.

Nathan McGrath of the Fairness Center, a nonprofit law firm that represents workers in disputes with unions, told the 2nd Circuit on Monday that Knight merely addressed who can bargain with public employers and not whether exclusive representation itself is constitutional.

McGrath said a 2018 Supreme Court ruling in Janus v. AFSCME, which held that public-sector unions cannot require non-members to pay fees to cover bargaining costs, made clear that public employees cannot be forced to support a union's speech. But Circuit Judges Guido Calabresi and Alison Nathan seemed skeptical.

""You may be right that that's what the Supreme Court had in mind, but they didn't hold it,"" Calabresi said.

McGrath maintained that Knight ""doesn't stand for the proposition that there is constitutional immunity for any type of violation that could come from the exclusive representation system.""

Nathan said that striking down exclusive representation would pose practical issues, particularly in light of Knight's bar on individual workers having a voice at the bargaining table.

The judge seemed to agree when Cleland Welton of the New York Attorney General's office, who argued for CUNY, said there would be significant variations in working conditions for professors covered by bargaining agreements and those who are not. Welton said that, for example, non-union professors could potentially be paid less.

And that, Nathan said, ""would force membership or incentivize membership in a way that would be constitutionally problematic.""

The panel also included Circuit Judge Amalya Kearse, who did not speak during the argument. All three judges are appointees of Democratic presidents.

Janus was a major victory for critics of public-sector unions, but has not had the devastating impact on union finances that some experts predicted or led to other legal setbacks for unions. Several appeals courts have rejected challenges to exclusive union representation, including claims that Janus overruled Knight.

The case is Goldstein v. Professional Staff Congress CUNY, 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, No. 23-384.

For the plaintiffs: Nathan McGrath of the Fairness Center; William Messenger of the National Right to Work Legal Defense and Education Foundation

For the union: Scott Kronland of Altshuler Berzon

For CUNY: Cleland Welton of the New York State Attorney General's office

(CBS DETROIT) - Nine people were arrested in a statewide warrant sweep, the Michigan Attorney General's office announced Monday.

State officials say the Michigan Department of Attorney General, Detroit Police Department, and various local law enforcement agencies conducted a statewide warrant sweep on Nov. 16.

The nine arrests were related to crimes of operating as unlicensed builders and fraud against the Michigan Unemployment Insurance Agency (UIA), Attorney General Dana Nessel said in a press release.

Authorities conducted the sweep in Ingham, Lapeer, Livingston, Macomb, Mecosta, Oakland, Roscommon, Saginaw, and Wayne counties.

Some targets of the warrant sweep remain out of custody, according to Nessel.

""I'm thankful to the many law enforcement agencies and officers who made this successful sweep possible, along with the special agents from my Department,"" Nessel said in a written statement. ""When fraudsters and bad actors harm consumers and Michigan residents, we will pursue justice however and wherever needed.""

Officials say defendants were provided a bond and notice to appear by their local court.

Court dates have not yet been set.

Nessel said cases against the unlicensed builders were initiated by consumer complaints to the Department of Licensing and Regulatory Affairs (LARA) alleging failure to perform substandard work agreed to in a contract and no proof of license.

Officials say there has been a significant increase in cases of unlicensed builders since 2020.","{'uri': 'cbsnews.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'CBS News'}",[],https://assets3.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2023/11/07/498ed496-70a8-4aa0-9a82-ecb3045ef690/thumbnail/1200x630/54c6ad39ff6bfd179ed1a80289935915/gettyimages-1459710019.jpg?v=5659e73acd91751548aa89950cf015b0,,-0.192156862745098,25,25,CBS News,cbsnews.com

Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com.

New Hampshire should be spending at least 80% more per pupil on public schools, a judge said Monday in one of two rulings that could force significant changes to education funding.

Lawmakers have been grappling with the issue for decades after the state Supreme Court ruled in the 1990s that the state is required to provide and pay for an adequate education. In response, the Legislature began sending each school district a set amount of aid per pupil -- currently $4,100. Actual costs are much higher, however, and local property taxpayers make up the difference, with wide disparities due to differences in property wealth between communities.

JUDGE TOSSES NEW HAMPSHIRE TEACHERS UNION BID TO SHOOT DOWN VOUCHER PROGRAM

Conval Regional School District and 17 others challenged the base amount in court in 2019, and after a trial in April, Rockingham County Judge David Ruoff agreed with them Monday that the current allocation is unconstitutional. While the plaintiffs argued aid must be increased to at least $9,900 per pupil, Ruoff declined to set a definitive amount but said it should be at least $7,356.

In his order, Ruoff said while he is mindful that the Legislature has the final say, school funding is a ""complicated and politically-charged issue with a history that suggests some level of judicial intervention is now necessary."" He suggested politics have impeded the state's duty to children, but said ""that ends today.""

NEW HAMPSHIRE'S RECOVERY-FRIENDLY WORKPLACE PROGRAM EXPANDS TO NATIONWIDE INSTITUTE

In a separate case, Ruoff also found the state has violated the constitution by not redistributing excess money collected via the statewide education property tax from wealthier towns to poorer communities.

The rulings are likely to be appealed. A spokesperson for the attorney general's office, which represented the state, said officials were reviewing the orders and considering next steps.

Kimberly Rizzo Saunders, superintendent of the Conval Regional School District, said the court recognized the substantial evidence offered by plaintiffs.

The fatal incident unfolded nearly two months ago on Sept. 28 when 68-year-old Craig Sumer Elliott went out for a jog with his two dogs while pushing a pushcart on a sidewalk in the 10400 block of Katella Avenue, where he encountered the victim, 40-year-old Antonio Garcia.

Elliott allegedly used his pushcart to nudge Avalos to wake him up and get around him, according to the Orange County District Attorney. When he woke up, Avalos began yelling at Elliott to get away from him.

The 68-year-old recorded the confrontation. His video shows Avalos standing up and throwing a shoe at Elliott. In retaliation, Elliott pulled a gun from his push cart and shot Avalos three times, killing him.

Elliott had an active concealed carry with the Orange County Sheriff's Department when he allegedly shot and killed Avalos.

The Garden Grove Police Department arrested Elliott on Nov. 17. Prosecutors charged him with voluntary manslaughter with one felony enhancement of personal use of a firearm. He has since been released on a $100,000 bail.

In a ruling on November 10, a judge concluded that Harry - along with other high-profile individuals including Sir Elton John and Baroness Doreen Lawrence - could continue their claims over alleged unlawful information gathering against Associated Newspapers (ANL).

The trio are among a group of high-profile individuals - including Sir Elton's husband David Furnish, actresses Sadie Frost and Liz Hurley and ex-MP Sir Simon Hughes - accusing the publisher of carrying out or commissioning unlawful activities such as hiring private investigators to place listening devices inside cars, ""blagging"" private records and accessing and recording private phone conversations.

Sir Elton John is part of the group bringing legal action against Associated Newspapers (Aaron Chown/PA)

ANL, which firmly denies the allegations, had asked a judge at a hearing in March to rule in its favour without a trial, arguing the legal challenges were brought ""far too late"".

But Mr Justice Nicklin ruled ANL had ""not been able to deliver a 'knockout blow' to the claims"" earlier this month.

In his 95-page-judgment, the judge said that each of the seven people in the ANL claim have a ""real prospect"" of demonstrating that ANL concealed ""relevant facts"" that would have allowed them to bring a claim against the publisher earlier.

A hearing is now due to take place on Tuesday to deal with the consequences of the judgment.

The cases remain at an early stage and ANL has yet to file a formal defence in the case which could see a third High Court trial centred on Harry's allegations of unlawful information gathering against major newspaper publishers.

Following the ruling, ANL said in a statement: ""As we have always made unequivocally clear, the lurid claims made by Prince Harry and others of phone hacking, landline tapping, burglary and sticky-window microphones are simply preposterous and we look forward to establishing this in court in due course.""

Monday, Andrea and Timothy Carpenter saw firsthand the crushed Ford Escape their 22-year-old son was riding in on March 19 when a 40-year-old man, allegedly high on fentanyl, killed him with his pickup truck.

The Carpenter's son's death is among a troubling rise in traffic fatalities nationwide that prosecutors and police want to prevent with a new bill.

""The loophole in the drugged driving law needs to be closed,"" said Nassau County District Attorney Anne Donnelly.

Under the state's current law, an impaired driver can only be arrested if the officer can name the drug impairing them. But the test to identify the drug can only be administered after the arrest.

""In other words, if a person is impaired by the use of drugs, but refuses a test, law enforcement must engage in a guessing game, which of course they cannot do. So they have to release that person,"" said Suffolk County District Attorney Raymond Tierney.

New York also requires a drug to be on a public health law list to trigger a drugged driving violation, but prosecutors say the list doesn't keep pace with the proliferation of rapidly changing synthetic drugs.

""It is long overdue for New York state to resolve issues in the law that make it hard to successfully gather critical evidence in these cases. This deprives victims of justice,"" said Alisa McMorris, whose son was killed in a DWI crash.

Without a change, these families say dangerous criminals will stay on the road.

The families said they will head to Albany on Jan. 9 to push for the bill's passage.","{'uri': 'cbsnews.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'CBS News'}",[],https://assets1.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2023/11/20/0006e661-d687-4ae0-93be-eb8a8da3716f/thumbnail/1200x630/771f5d35808614d1fdd146550d4dcfe4/new-fan-6p-pkg-li-drivi-wcbs8i7m-hi-res-still.jpg?v=5659e73acd91751548aa89950cf015b0,,-0.3490196078431372,25,25,CBS News,cbsnews.com

Please try again later{{ /verifyErrors }}

State authorities were investigating Monday after a California Highway Patrol officer shot and killed a man over the weekend in the middle of a Los Angeles area freeway during a struggle recorded on video.

Sunday afternoon's deadly encounter occurred after the highway patrol responded to multiple calls of a male pedestrian walking in westbound lanes of Interstate 105 in south LA County, the agency said in a statement. All traffic in that direction was temporarily blocked.

""During the contact with the pedestrian, a struggle ensued and an officer involved shooting occurred,"" the statement said.

The Los Angeles County medical examiner's office confirmed the person died but did not provide identification, pending notification of family. A cause of death was not immediately released.

The highway patrol referred inquiries about the investigation to the California Department of Justice, which typically investigates fatal police shootings. The justice department confirmed it was investigating, but provided no additional details.

A minute-long video recorded by a bystander and posted on social media begins with an officer on top of another person as the two grapple in the middle of a closed stretch of freeway. It was not clear who took the original video.

As they struggle, a shot is fired and the officer suddenly jumps to his feet while the other man goes limp on the pavement. The officer immediately fires at least four shots at the prone man, the video shows. For the remainder of the clip, the officer keeps his gun drawn while the man lies motionless.

Ed Obayashi, a use-of-force expert who investigates police shootings for law enforcement agencies in California, cautioned against jumping to conclusions from the video alone.

Obayashi said investigators will want to know why the officer approached the pedestrian without a partner or other backup nearby. ""They were able to close the freeway, so presumably there was law enforcement in the area,"" he said.

Obayashi said the investigation will focus on whether the man was armed and why the officer felt the need to shoot after standing up and disengaging from the fight.

""Was there a knife? Or a stun gun?"" Obayashi said investigators will ask. ""We don't know what kind of threat this officer perceived.""","{'uri': 'independent.co.uk', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'The Independent'}",[],https://static.independent.co.uk/2023/11/20/22/California_Highway_Patrol_Shooting_38061.jpg?quality=75&width=1200&auto=webp,eng-9078791,-0.2549019607843137,25,25,The Independent,independent.co.uk

DuPont had asked the high court in June to review the case, saying its defense was hamstrung during Travis Abbott's 2020 trial.

The company said Abbott's case is unique, as are the thousands of lawsuits alleging that a West Virginia DuPont plant discharged cancer-causing Perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) into the Ohio River consolidated in multidistrict litigation (MDL) in Ohio federal court. DuPont claimed a lower court improperly restricted it from contesting findings that it negligently exposed people to PFOA from lawsuits that were tried earlier as test trials, or ""bellwethers.""

Doing so kept the company from mounting a defense that key elements of the cases are different, including specifics of Abbott's PFOA exposure, it said.

The company had asked the justices to determine the court cannot make the results from bellwether trials binding on the company in every other case within the MDL.

As is customary, the court's order was issued without further explanation.

DuPont did not immediately respond to a request for comment. An attorney for Abbott said they are pleased with the court's decision.

PFOA is among a class of chemicals called per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances, or PFAS, that are used in wide range of products including non-stick cookware and firefighting foams, and are associated with certain cancers, hormonal dysfunction and other diseases.

They are referred to as ""forever chemicals"" because they don't easily break down in the human body or nature.

The company appealed Abbott's trial victory to the 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in 2021, arguing the bellwethers were never intended to be representative of every case in the MDL, many of which have settled.

DuPont argued Abbott's circumstances were much different from the plaintiffs in the bellwether trials. For example, his water wells were up to 56 miles away from the plant, while two of the bellwether plaintiffs got water less than a mile away. Those differences could have convinced a jury Abbott's injuries were not reasonably foreseeable to DuPont.

The 6th Circuit upheld the lower court's decision, finding it was right to conclude that DuPont's behavior impacted the plaintiffs in virtually identical ways, so it was appropriate to bar the company from relitigating arguments it had repeatedly lost before.

Dissenting from the high court's decision not to grant review, Justice Clarence Thomas said Monday the bellwether trials were not meant to be representative of all the cases in the multidistrict litigation, and DuPont should not have been barred from contesting elements of negligence found in those earlier cases.

Justice Brett Kavanaugh said he would have heard the case.

The case is E.I. du Pont de Nemours & Co v. Abbott, U.S. Supreme Court, No. 23-13.

Patricia Martin, 64, was indicted on Nov. 9 on three counts of theft, two counts of financial exploitation of an elderly person, one count of money laundering, and one count of financial institution fraud.

According to the indictment, the thefts happened between December 2020 and October 2022. She's accused of moving money from her uncle Oscar Wilkerson's bank accounts to at least two other accounts in an effort to cover up the thefts, and used the money for cryptocurrency investments in her own name.

The Illinois Supreme Court disbarred Martin in September, after she previously admitted to misconduct.

""She intentionally used for her own purposes more than $240,000 she had agreed to hold for an elderly relative who was residing in a nursing home, made false statements to the physician who held her relative's power of attorney about the balances in his bank and investment accounts, and did not produce documents in response to an ARDC subpoena,"" according to the court's Attorney Registration and Disciplinary Commission.

She had been licensed to practice law in Illinois since 1986 before the state's highest court stripped her of her license in September.

CBS 2's Chris Tye first broke the story about Martin's conduct.

Martin, who spent 24 years on the bench, retired as Cook County's top juvenile court judge in 2020.

Around the same time, the Illinois Supreme Court - which investigates attorney misbehavior - alleges that as her uncle's power of attorney, Martin ""used at least $246,203.80 of... funds without his authority for her own personal purposes.""

""If you can't trust a judge, who can you trust?"" said Ken Rapier, a friend of Martin's uncle, Oscar Wilkerson, a former Tuskegee Airman who died in February. ""It really upsets me when somebody takes advantage of the Tuskegee Airmen.""

Five months before he died, Wilkerson - who lived his final days at a south suburban retirement center - sued Martin.

The lawsuit accused Martin of stealing hundreds of thousands of dollars from Wilkerson and converting it into ""cryptocurrency that she held in her own name and over which she maintained exclusive control.""

Due to her ""continued unresponsiveness"" to court hearings and orders, a judge ordered Martin to pay three times as much - $1.1 million dollars - to Wilkerson's estate.

Along the way, court rulings indicate Judge Martin failed to show up and follow court orders - which led to an investigation by Cook County State's Attorney Kim Foxx's office.

Martin has owned since owned up to misconduct.

In an affidavit obtained by CBS 2, Martin acknowledged ""the evidence would clearly and convincingly establish the facts and conclusions of misconduct.""

CBS 2 Legal Analyst Irv Miller called Martin's admission a massive fall from grace.

""It's going to shake the entire Circuit Court of Cook County,"" he said. ""She's agreeing that the evidence against her clearly - and she uses the word 'clearly' - establishes that she committed misconduct in this particular case.""

Despite that admission, Martin has argued she shouldn't have to pay the $1.1 million to Wilkerson's estate, since her uncle is now dead.

""The plaintiff's death,"" her lawyer wrote, ""suspend[s] the court's jurisdiction"" in this matter.

""They're making a technical argument - frankly, it may have merit - that because the plaintiff died while this proceeding was pending, there is no proper plaintiff - and if there is no proper plaintiff, the lawsuit can't proceed,"" Miller said.

In July, Cook County prosecutors charged Martin with criminal contempt of court related to court orders - as recently as this April - where the court ordered Martin ""not to move funds of Oscar Wilkerson.""

Regardless, prosecutors say, Judge Martin kept moving funds - $598 here, $277 there - and more and more. Prosecutors say Martin transferred much of the money to Bitcoin, and they say have the receipts they say prove it.

""Even if you're a former judge, you cannot thumb your nose at a court order - and that's what the current judge hearing the case has indicated occurred in this case,"" Miller said, ""and that's why she was pretty upset about it.""

Martin made her first appearance on the theft and money laundering charges on Friday, and is due back in court in Bridgeview on Dec. 20. She was allowed to remain free as she awaits trial.","{'uri': 'cbsnews.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'CBS News'}",[],https://assets1.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2023/07/31/0f96449b-4e02-46bd-8c1a-fab960a3e827/thumbnail/1200x630/ec8398844559a3580c7c8f2f95c3c052/judge-patricia-martin.jpg?v=5659e73acd91751548aa89950cf015b0,,-0.1137254901960785,25,25,CBS News,cbsnews.com

But for Philadelphia, available staffing is already a challenge.

Officially, Philadelphia police say the strike will have minimal impact on calls for help. They'll respond, but a SEPTA police work stoppage means questions about a naturally increased volume of fewer available officers.

The officers cover SEPTA property across the city and into Delaware, Bucks, Chester and Montgomery Counties - as well as regional rail that reaches Trenton and Wilmington.

At the massive 69th Street transportation hub, SEPTA police stay busy answering calls.

A source within the Upper Darby Township Police Department said a strike would amount to a ""headache"" for his officers.

Scheduled days off would be canceled depending on the length of the strike.

SEPTA said it would also add more security guards for the Market-Frankford and Broad Street Lines.

He was also named in a report that alleges racist and antisemitic language from police leaders.

On Monday, both the mayor and police department of a New Jersey township were accused of abuse of power in unrelated incidents that saw the city's top official criminally charged and the state attorney general recommending the ouster of the police chief and a sergeant.

Sal Bonaccorso, 63, who has been the mayor of Clark since 2001 and came under fire a year ago when he was secretly recorded using racist language, is accused of falsifying records to benefit his landscaping company.

State officials say the Office of Public Integrity and Accountability determined that Bonaccorso ran his underground tank-removal business, Bonaccorso & Son LLC, out of his township office and used municipal resources. He is accused of using township equipment including computers and fax machines, and directing township workers ""solely for the purpose of running his private business,"" according to a statement.

""Any elected leader who abuses his power and position and misuses public property and public employees for his own benefit, at taxpayers' expense, betrays the public's trust,"" New Jersey Attorney General Matthew J. Platkin said in a statement.

The mayor has been charged with second-degree misconduct, third-degree tampering with public records or information, third-degree witness tampering, fourth-degree forgery and fourth-degree falsifying or tampering with records, the AG said.

Bonaccorso could not be reached for comment Monday afternoon.

Clark, a town of 15,200 about 13 miles south of Newark, is about 90 percent white and 2 percent of its residents are Black. The 4.3-square-mile community of well-manicured lawns and comfortable homes has a median income of about $114,000, according to the U.S. Census Bureau.

The AG on Monday also detailed the results of a separate investigation involving Clark's police department and alleged racist, sexist and antisemitic behavior in a withering 43-page report.

The mayor, Police Chief Pedro Matos and Sgt. Joseph Teston, who leads the internal affairs unit, allegedly used problematic language while discussing hiring practices, the AG's report said.

Platkin is recommending Matos and Teston be fired.

Matos and Teston could not be reached for comment Monday afternoon.

Matos routinely failed to forward allegations of wrongdoing to the county prosecutor's office and ""violated the standard of conduct related to derogatory comments, and failed to conduct internal affairs investigations,"" according to a statement.

The Union County prosecutor's and the state's Attorney General's Office office took over Clark's police department in July 2020 amid misconduct allegations. The state attorney general promised a public report on the problems there, NBC New York reported.

Teston violated the standard of conduct for derogatory comments and failed to conduct internal affairs investigations, Platkin said.

He was also arrested in 2022 outside a professional sports arena in New York, the AG's Office said. The charges were ultimately dropped, but Teston admitted to striking an unarmed person with a glass bottle and fleeing.

Platkin's recommendations for termination of the officers are not binding, a statement said.

In 2022, audio recordings surfaced capturing Bonaccorso using profanity and racist language, thrusting the mayor and his small town into the national spotlight. Bonaccorso resisted calls to resign. He apologized in April 2022.

Bonaccorso acknowledged he is heard on secret audio recordings made by former Clark police Lt. Antonio Manata. Bonaccorso on the recordings uses the N-word and other derogatory terms.

Wilkinson Stekloff is among the ""boutique"" law firms that typically pay higher bonuses than bigger firms. New York law firm Milbank, the only large U.S. law firm to publicly announce annual bonus figures so far this year, said earlier this month that it will hand out bonuses ranging from $15,000 to $115,000 based on seniority.

Bonuses for first-year associates at Wilkinson Stekloff will start at $26,250 and increase by class year, according to a Monday internal email viewed by Reuters. The firm will pay out the bonuses by Dec. 15.

""We are delighted to recognize the phenomenal contributions our associates make to the success of our clients and the firm,"" Wilkinson Stekloff said in a statement.

The firm's website lists 23 associates. There are also four counsel, who according to the internal email will hear about their bonuses separately.

Wilkinson Stekloff's partners said in the internal email that it was an ""extraordinary and unprecedented year,"" and it had five separate cases go to trial, a record for the firm.

Milbank announced its bonuses for associates on Nov. 7, alongside a new higher base salary scale ranging from $225,000 for its most junior lawyers up to $425,000 for eighth-year associates. Milbank's bonus amounts are the same as it gave out last year.

The country's biggest law firms typically adjust their salary scales within days or weeks of one another to remain competitive. No other large firm has yet publicly matched or exceeded Milbank's salary scale, and are likely waiting to see what peer firms do.","{'uri': 'reuters.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'Reuters'}","[{'uri': 'sara_merken@reuters.com', 'name': 'Sara Merken', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': False}]",https://www.reuters.com/resizer/2xggDnmCmv5HEkLz7Bwi6weTziY=/728x381/smart/filters:quality(80)/cloudfront-us-east-2.images.arcpublishing.com/reuters/E33YGNVLEZKEXDIIGKY7OSGIGM.jpg,,0.5215686274509803,25,25,Reuters,reuters.com

""Clark is very good, a good place. And [Bonaccorso] made it better than the mayor before him,"" a Clark resident said before the charges were announced.

Platkin said the criminal charges came as a result of another investigation into the police department, its chief and claims of racist comments made by the mayor at another official.

The document, published by the Centre for Brexit Policy, said Britain should give its 'intention to quit' the ECHR and the Strasbourg court which oversees implementation of the treaty.

Mr Howe added: 'Even if the UK courts allow removals to Rwanda to go ahead, migrants' lawyers can then make direct petitions to the Strasbourg court. It is doomed to fail.'

It comes as details of the new Rwanda asylum laws were accidentally revealed outside No10 yesterday.

Officials were snapped by photographers as they carried papers that appeared to be draft versions of the emergency legislation pledged by Mr Sunak.

It revealed the proposed name of the law as the Asylum (Removal to Rwanda) Bill.

A visible summary said it would set out measures 'requiring the removal to Rwanda of asylum seekers'.

In a speech in London, Mr Sunak said: 'I'm committed to doing what is necessary to get that scheme up and running.

'And I won't let a foreign court stop us from getting flights off to Rwanda.'","{'uri': 'dailymail.co.uk', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'Daily Mail Online'}",[],https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2023/11/20/21/78037505-0-image-a-79_1700515920214.jpg,eng-9074973,-0.06666666666666665,25,25,Daily Mail Online,dailymail.co.uk

The 2-1 decision by a panel of the 8th Circuit Court of Appeals based in St. Louis found that only the U.S. attorney general can enforce Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act, which prohibits discriminatory voting practices such as racially gerrymandered districts.

The majority said other federal laws, including the 1964 Civil Rights Act, make it clear when private groups can sue said but similar wording is not found in the voting law.

""When those details are missing, it is not our place to fill in the gaps, except when 'text and structure´ require it,"" U.S. Circuit Judge David R. Stras wrote for the majority in an opinion joined by Judge Raymond W. Gruender. Stras was nominated by former President Donald Trump and Gruender by former President George W. Bush.

The decision affirmed a lower judge´s decision to dismiss a case brought by the Arkansas State Conference NAACP and the Arkansas Public Policy Panel after giving U.S. Attorney General Merrick B. Garland five days to join the lawsuit. Neither organization immediately returned messages seeking comment Monday.

Chief Judge Lavenski R. Smith noted in a dissenting opinion that federal courts across the country and the U.S. Supreme Court have considered numerous cases brought by private plaintiffs under Section 2. Smith said the court should follow ""existing precedent that permits a judicial remedy"" unless the Supreme Court or Congress decides differently.

""Rights so foundational to self-government and citizenship should not depend solely on the discretion or availability of the government´s agents for protection,"" wrote Smith, another appointee of George W. Bush.

The ruling applies only to federal courts covered by the 8th Circuit, which includes Arkansas, Iowa, Minnesota, Missouri, Nebraska, North Dakota and South Dakota. Meanwhile, several pending lawsuits by private groups challenge various political maps drawn by legislators across the country.

A representative for the Justice Department declined to comment.

It's not the final word on the 14th Amendment.

We now have arguably the most important 14th Amendment ruling about Donald Trump to date. Friday's decision from Colorado isn't entirely convincing, but its most useful feature may be that it lays the groundwork for the U.S. Supreme Court to weigh in.

Colorado District Judge Sarah Wallace found in her lengthy opinion that Trump engaged in insurrection. That might lead one to think that Trump is therefore barred from the presidency under the Constitution's insurrection clause. But Wallace also said the president isn't an ""officer"" under the provision in question, so, according to the Colorado state judge, Trump isn't banned from the presidency despite his otherwise unconstitutional behavior. My colleague Hayes Brown explained why it's a dubious distinction on Wallace's part.

But the state trial judge won't have the last word. Importantly, unlike other courts that have punted on the subject recently, Wallace issued an actual ruling, based on facts and evidence, even if her conclusion is wanting. On that note, the Colorado challengers are attacking the ""officer"" distinction on appeal to the state's Supreme Court. If they're successful in doing so -- leading to a ruling that Trump is ineligible -- then the U.S. Supreme Court will more likely step in to make a definitive, nationwide ruling.

The U.S. justices have discretion over their docket, but they'll be more likely to review a decision that keeps Trump off the ballot; if a lower federal court or state high court says he can stay on the ballot, then the justices can maintain the status quo by simply rejecting any appeals of such decisions and declining to get involved.

But if the Colorado Supreme Court endorses her insurrection finding yet disagrees with her ""officer"" rationale on legal grounds, then Wallace's decision may have been the first step in the issue's judicial resolution.","{'uri': 'msnbc.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'MSNBC.com'}",[],"https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_nbcnews-fp-1024-512,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2023-11/231120-donald-trump-jm-1433-bd1a4b.jpg",eng-9075414,0.1843137254901961,25,25,MSNBC.com,msnbc.com

Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com.

Michigan Democrats who have transformed gun laws in the state in the wake of multiple mass school shootings are now making it more difficult for individuals with convictions for misdemeanor domestic violence from gaining access to guns.

Gov. Gretchen Whitmer signed legislation Monday that prohibits individuals convicted of a misdemeanor related to domestic violence from possessing firearms for at least an eight-year-period. State law currently includes firearm restrictions for those with felonies related to domestic abuse, but no law had existed for misdemeanor domestic violence.

""These bills are based on a simple idea: if you have been found guilty in court for violently assaulting your partner, you should not be able to access a deadly weapon that you could use to further threatened, harm or kill them."" Whitmer said at a bill signing in Kalamazoo. ""It's just common sense.""

MICHIGAN DEMS, GRETCHEN WHITMER ARE PURSUING A GREEN NEW DEAL, THREATENING FUTURE GRID STABILITY

MICHIGAN JURY ACQUITS 3 MEN IN PLOT TO KIDNAP GOV. GRETCHEN WHITMER

The eight-year ban for misdemeanor domestic violence convictions is only the latest firearm restriction added to Michigan law since Democrats took control of both chambers of the state Legislature and retained the governor's office last election.

Legislation implementing red flag laws, stricter background checks and safe storage requirements were all signed by Whitmer earlier this year. The overhauled gun laws follow two deadly mass school shootings that happened in Michigan within a 14-month period.

Democratic State Sen. Stephanie Chang, a lead sponsor of the bill package, said Monday that the latest legislation would put Michigan in line with similar laws in 31 other states and the District of Columbia.

Federal law already prohibits those charged with felonies or misdemeanors related to domestic violence from purchasing or possessing a gun. But advocates have pushed for state-level laws that they say can be better enforced and won't be threatened by future Supreme Court rulings.

Earlier this month, the Supreme Court took up a challenge to a federal law that prohibits people from having guns if they are under a court order to stay away from their spouse, partner or other family members. The nation's high court heard arguments on Nov. 7 and seemed likely to preserve the federal law.

""As the Supreme Court weighs whether to uphold common-sense laws to disarm domestic abusers, Governor Whitmer and the Michigan legislature are taking a clear stand: If you have a history of intimate partner violence, you have no business owning a gun,"" John Feinblatt, president of Everytown for Gun Safety, said in a statement.

Firearms are the most common weapon used in homicides of spouses, intimate partners, children or relatives in recent years, according to data from the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Guns were used in more than half, 57%, of those killings in 2020, a year that saw an overall increase in domestic violence during the coronavirus pandemic.

Under the legislation signed Monday in Michigan, people convicted of a misdemeanor that involved domestic violence will be not allowed to purchase, possess, or use a firearm or ammunition until they have completed the terms of imprisonment, paid all fines and eight years had passed.

The parents of Maggie Wardle, a 19-year-old shot and killed by an ex-boyfriend at Kalamazoo College in 1999, spoke in support of the legislation at Monday's signing.

""This law, now passed and signed into law today, will save someone's life and give them the chance to live a full meaningful life, the chance Maggie did not get,"" Rick Omillian, Maggie's stepfather, said Monday.","{'uri': 'foxnews.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'Fox News'}",[],https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2023/11/Gretchen-Whitmer.gif,eng-9078389,-0.3568627450980392,25,25,Fox News,foxnews.com

That concern led the 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals last week to undo the certification of five statewide classes of Ford (F.N) pickup owners who claimed that their trucks' braking systems were defectively designed. Judges Danny Boggs, Amul Thapar and Chad Readler said in a per curiam opinion that the trial judge, U.S. District Judge Gershwin Drain of Detroit, abused his discretion by failing to explain why class allegations could be evaluated in a single proceeding.

Specifically, the 6th Circuit held that Drain did not provide sufficient analysis on commonality, one of the threshold requirements for class certification under Rule 23 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.

The trial judge had certified only issues classes, rather than classes seeking money damages, in order to eliminate individual questions about reliance and timeliness. He also avoided variations in state consumers laws by certifying different issue classes for pickup owners in different states.

But the judge was nevertheless obliged, the 6th Circuit said, to explain why there is only one classwide answer to the questions of whether Ford's brake system was defective, whether Ford knew about the defects, and whether the allegedly concealed information would have been important to pickup truck purchasers.

Ford, which is represented by Dykema Gossett, Bush Seyferth and O'Melveny & Myers, declined to comment on the ruling.

Plaintiffs lawyers from DiCello Levitt; The Miller Law Firm; Beasley, Allen, Crow, Methvin, Portis & Miles; and Lieff Cabraser Heimann & Bernstein said via email that they are confident the issue classes will be recertified on remand to Drain, the trial judge.

""The element of commonality is supported by the law and the facts,"" said Powell Miller of the Miller firm.

Drain certified five statewide classes (from Alabama, California, Florida, Georgia and Texas) to determine if a Hitachi-made component of the braking system led to defects. The judge dedicated only a few paragraphs to the commonality requirement, concluding that all of the class claims arose from the same alleged defect.

Even though the issue class would not definitively establish Ford's liability to each class member, Drain said, a jury trial on the alleged defect and Ford's knowledge of it would go a long way toward resolving the case.

""If the jury concludes there is no defect or that the defect is not material, plaintiffs' claims fail,"" the trial judge said. ""Conversely, if the jury finds there is a material defect then the scope of subsequent trials will be narrowed significantly.""

Ford argued in its petition for interlocutory review of Drain's ruling that the issue is not nearly as simple as Drain's analysis suggested. Ford said there were several changes to the design and manufacturing process for the allegedly problematic part over the long class period. It also insisted that its knowledge of the alleged defect changed over that time period.

So, according to Ford, Drain framed the commonality question incorrectly. Under the U.S. Supreme Court's 2011 decision in Wal-Mart Stores Inc. v. Dukes, Ford said, class certification depends not on whether a jury might find a single answer to the design defect question but whether the question can only have one answer.

""Plaintiffs must show that a reasonable jury would have to answer the question the same for every class member,"" Ford said. ""If, based on the evidence, a reasonable jury could answer the question differently for different class members, the question cannot be 'common to the class' for purposes of Rule 23.""

Plaintiffs lawyers responded that the trial judge did, in fact, consider -- and reject -- Ford's arguments about variations across model years in the allegedly defective Hitachi [RIC:RIC:HITCHG.UL] parts. According to class counsel, Drain determined that any variations were too inconsequential to divert from the classwide issue of whether the brake system was defective.

The 6th Circuit, though, sided with Ford. The design defect question is only appropriate for a classwide resolution, the appeals court said, ""if the same malfunction could have corrupted the brake cylinders of all the relevant F-150 model years.""

It may be that modifications to the allegedly problematic part were too minor to bar classwide resolution of the defect question, the 6th Circuit said. The court said it may also be of no consequence that plaintiffs are alleging two distinct theories for how the purported defect affected the braking system. But the trial judge simply did not provide assurances that he took these considerations into account, the appeals court said.

""That analysis is all but absent,"" the opinion said. ""All we have is the summary conclusion.""

Ford had asked the court to rule that the trial judge erroneously viewed the evidence in the light most favorable to the plaintiffs in reaching his decision on class certification. The 6th Circuit did not go as far as that, but said Drain, on remand, ""must evaluate whether each of the four Rule 23(a) factors is actually satisfied, not merely that the factors are properly alleged.""

The appeals court did not reach Ford's alternative argument that plaintiffs failed to meet Rule 23's superiority requirement because they hadn't shown issue classes to be the most efficient way to resolve the dispute. The plaintiffs countered that the 6th Circuit has already joined other circuits in holding that issue classes are a superior means of resolving claims when plaintiffs otherwise meet Rule 23's threshold requirements.","{'uri': 'reuters.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'Reuters'}","[{'uri': 'alison_frankel@reuters.com', 'name': 'Alison Frankel', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': False}]",https://www.reuters.com/resizer/KRihzwdclm1LsqwjyTZZwQAz50U=/728x381/smart/filters:quality(80)/cloudfront-us-east-2.images.arcpublishing.com/reuters/MQNQLXLITNM5ZBYI7ITXLKAZ3M.jpg,,-0.3019607843137255,25,25,Reuters,reuters.com

He couldn't be more wrong,"The latest opinion denying a challenge to Donald Trump's eligibility to run for president has occasioned a lot of teeth-gnashing about how the court, in the words of Colorado's secretary of state, gave Trump a ""get-out-of-jail-free card for insurrection."" The frustration is understandable but shortsighted.

In fact, the opinion by Colorado District Judge Sarah B. Wallace is a giant step toward disqualifying Trump from the ballot on constitutional grounds.

The Colorado challenge is one of several brought under Section 3 of the 14th Amendment, which disqualifies officials who ""have engaged in insurrection"" against the United States from holding federal office. The provision gives rise to the argument that Trump is not qualified to run for president because of his role in the events of Jan. 6, 2021.

In the last few of its 102 pages, Wallace's opinion concludes that the president is not ""an officer of the United States"" for the purposes of the amendment and is therefore not disqualified from the ballot. Trump hailed this as ""a gigantic court victory.""

But the former president was either bluffing or being obtuse. In fact, the opinion goes nine-tenths of the way toward recognizing the challengers' claim and disqualifying Trump before opting for a close and questionable textual reading on the officer question. The ruling is far more important for how it goes against Trump than for the court's final change of direction.

Every other court that has taken up the 14th Amendment claim to date has shied away from adjudicating it on the merits, finding it was a political question or otherwise unsuited for determination by the courts. The Colorado judge, by contrast, held a week-long evidentiary hearing, taking testimony on the law and the facts.

Wallace's resulting opinion works methodically through the evidence to determine that Trump did indeed engage in insurrection, which only a trial court can do. In the process, she rejected Trump's 1st Amendment defense, finding that his intentional incitement of the Jan. 6 marauders overcame any free-speech claim.

The order that will be appealed to higher courts thus has nearly everything that would be needed to disqualify Trump from the ballot. Its final flinch on whether the president is an officer is a discrete question of textual interpretation that any appellate court could decide differently.

The challengers' brief, in fact, treated the officer issue almost as an afterthought, though a subsequent Wall Street Journal op-ed by former Atty. Gen. Michael Mukasey brought new attention to the question. And the conclusion that the president is not an officer has drawn ferocious criticism from eminent scholars, including the conservative former appellate Judge J. Michael Luttig, who called it ""unfathomable.""

However weak or strong the claim -- I don't think it's as ridiculous as others contend -- the important point is that higher courts will decide it as a question of law. They may well disagree with Wallace on that point while adopting her far more important finding that Trump engaged in insurrection.

It's widely assumed that any appellate ruling disqualifying Trump from the ballot would prompt intervention by the U.S. Supreme Court, which would have the final say. And it's hard to imagine that the Supreme Court could or would make the determination that Trump engaged in insurrection without a factual record to review. In that way, Wallace's opinion sets what had been an empty table for the court.

Of course, appellate courts could agree with Wallace on the officer question or differ with her on other legal grounds. A higher court could, for example, reject Wallace's definition of insurrection as ""any public use of force or threat of force by a group of people to hinder or prevent the execution of law"" -- an expansive definition based on a historical analysis of the term's meaning during Reconstruction, when the 14th Amendment was adopted. Higher courts could also hold that enforcement of Section 3 is a political question that only Congress can answer, though that would raise other questions about the states' power to ensure candidates meet other basic qualifications for the ballot.

The bottom line, however, is that the Colorado opinion gives the challengers what they needed most -- a determination that Trump engaged in insurrection -- while raising legal questions that the higher courts would have had to answer in any case. It thereby breathes new life into a potential legal solution to the Trump nightmare that might otherwise have remained quixotic.","{'uri': 'latimes.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'Los Angeles Times'}",[],https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/f0cb706/2147483647/strip/true/crop/4887x2749+0+255/resize/1200x675!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F69%2Fc5%2Fd45cdad6421688e499d435511c09%2Felection-2024-trump-insurrection-amendment-01177.jpg,eng-9075414,0.07450980392156858,25,25,Los Angeles Times,latimes.com

QUITTING the European Court of Human Rights is the only way to revive the Rwanda plan, Rishi Sunak has been told.

The PM's deportation scheme is doomed to fail as long as Britain is beholden to meddling judges in Strasbourg, a report says.

The Centre for Brexit Policy insists his emergency legislation after last week's Supreme Court defeat will not make the government immune to challenges on ECHR grounds.

Barrister Martin Howe has warned: ""The Rwanda removal scheme is still left vulnerable to ECHR-based legal challenges in the UK courts.

""There will be challenges based on individual circumstances even if emergency legislation reverses the effect of the Supreme Court decision, unless that emergency legislation is drafted to exclude those individual challenges as well.""

He also vowed to ignore ECHR so-called ""pyjama injunctions"" where anonymous Strasbourg judges scupper removal flights at the last minute.

In his report Mr Howe says the Euro court now actively ""subverts"" its original aim of protecting human rights.

He said: ""The Strasbourg Court has transformed it into something completely different, by acting effectively as a law-making body rather than sticking to its allotted task of interpreting the text which was agreed by the founding states.""

A new treaty with Rwanda will also be signed in the coming days to plug the holes raised by the Supreme Court around refugee safety.","{'uri': 'thesun.co.uk', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'The Sun'}","[{'uri': 'jack_elsom@thesun.co.uk', 'name': 'Jack Elsom', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': False}]",https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/SUNEXCL_gettyimages-457191852jpg-JS245706403-1.jpg?strip=all&quality=100&w=1920&h=1080&crop=1,eng-9074973,0.09019607843137245,25,25,The Sun,thesun.co.uk

Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com.

New York's highest court on Monday upheld a New York City law that forbids police from using chokeholds or compressing a person's diaphragm during an arrest, rejecting a challenge from police unions to a law passed after the death of George Floyd.

The New York Court of Appeals, in a unanimous decision, ruled that the law is clear in its language and that it does not conflict with an existing state law that bans police from using chokes.

The city's law came as governments across the country prohibited or severely limited the use of chokeholds or similar restraints by police following Floyd's death in 2020, which occurred as a Minneapolis police officer kneeled on his neck for several minutes.

NEW YORK CITY TO REDUCE POLICE NUMBERS, SLASH BUDGETS DUE TO BILLIONS SPENT ON MIGRANT CRISIS

NYC TO CUT OVERTIME PAY FOR POLICE DESPITE BEING UNDERSTAFFED BY 'THOUSANDS'

The Police Benevolent Association of the City of New York, along with other law enforcement unions, sued the city over its law and have argued that its language is vague as to what officers are allowed to do during an arrest. In a statement, John Nuthall, a spokesman for the Police Benevolent Association of the City of New York, said the ruling will provide clarity to officers.

""While this is not the outcome we had hoped for, the Court's decision is a victory insofar that it will provide our officers with greater certainty when it comes to the statute, because under this Court's decision, it must be proven at a minimum that an officer's action in fact 'impedes the person's ability to breathe,' was 'not accidental,' and was not a 'justifiable use of physical force,'"" Nuthall said.

The New York Police Department has long barred its officers from using chokeholds to subdue people. New York state also has a law banning police chokeholds that was named after Eric Garner, who was killed when a New York Police Department officer placed him in a chokehold in 2014.

The city's law, while banning chokes, also includes a provision that forbids officers from compressing a person's diaphragm. Such a compression, though kneeling, sitting or standing on a person's chest or back, can make it difficult to breathe.","{'uri': 'foxnews.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'Fox News'}",[],https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2023/11/New-York-Protest.gif,eng-9078194,-0.0980392156862745,25,25,Fox News,foxnews.com

The former US president’s legal team has signalled that it will fight any restrictions to the Supreme Court

A federal appeal court appeared inclined on Monday to reimpose at least some restrictions on Donald Trump’s speech in his landmark election subversion case. But the judges wrestled with how to craft a gag order that does not infringe on the former president’s free speech rights or prevent him from defending himself on the campaign trail.

The three judges on the panel asked sceptical and at times aggressive questions of lawyers on both sides while weighing whether to put back in place an order from a trial judge that barred Trump from inflammatory comments against prosecutors, potential witnesses and court staff.

The judges raised a litany of hypothetical scenarios that could arise in the months ahead as they considered how to fashion a balance between an order that protects Trump’s First Amendment rights and the need to protect “the criminal trial process and its integrity and its truth finding function.”

“There’s a balance that has to be undertaken here, and it’s a very difficult balance in this context,” Judge Patricia Millett told Cecil VanDevender, a lawyer with special counsel Jack Smith’s office. “But we have to use a careful scalpel here and not step into really sort of skewing the political arena, don’t we?”

VanDevender replied that he agreed but said he believed that the gag order imposed last month does strike the appropriate balance

The court did not immediately rule but its questions left open the possibility that it might narrow the gag order, setting parameters on what Trump, as both a criminal defendant and the leading candidate for the 2024 Republican presidential nomination, can and cannot say as the trial date nears. Trump’s team has signalled that it will fight any restrictions to the Supreme Court.

No matter the outcome, the stakes are high given the volume and intensity of Trump’s public comments about the case, the massive public platform he holds on social media and the campaign trail, and the limited legal precedent for restricting speech of political candidates – let alone for the White House – who are criminal defendants.

In a sign of the argument’s import, special counsel Smith himself attended, sitting in the front row of the courtroom in a building just blocks from the US Capitol stormed on January 6, 2021, by rioters motivated by Trump’s false claims about the election he lost to Democrat Joe Biden.

Monday’s arguments spanned nearly two-and-a-half hours, with Trump lawyer D John Sauer fielding most of the questions as he pressed his case that the gag order was too vague and an unconstitutional muzzling.

“The order is unprecedented, and it sets a terrible precedent for future restrictions on core political speech,” Sauer said. He described it as a “heckler’s veto,” unfairly relying on the theory that Trump’s speech might someday inspire other people to harass or intimidate his targets.

“They can’t draw a causal line from any social media post to threat or harassment when we have wall to wall media coverage of this case,” Sauer told the court.

But those points were greeted coolly by the court.Trump echoed Nazis with use of word ‘vermin’, Biden says

Judge Brad Garcia pressed Sauer to explain why the court should not take preventive steps before violence materialises against potential witnesses or others. Another judge noted that a Texas woman who has since been arrested was accused of making a death threat against the judge in the Trump case, Tanya Chutkan, just one day after Trump posted on social: “If you go after me, I’m coming after you!”

“This is predictably going to intensify as well as the threats, so why isn’t the District Court justified in taking a more proactive measure and not waiting for more and more threats to occur and stepping in to protect the integrity of the trial?” Garcia asked.

Another judge in the case, Cornelia Pillard, sharply questioned Sauer over whether he believed any restrictions on Trump’s speech were allowed, telling him: “I don’t hear you giving any weight at all to the interest in a fair trial.”

Judge Millett recoiled at Sauer’s argument that Trump was merely engaged in core political speech.

“Labelling it core political speech begs the question if it’s political speech or speech aimed at derailing the criminal process,” she said.

But the judges also repeatedly wondered where to strike a balance, raising the prospect that the order could be narrow. Millett at one point expressed incredulity at the idea that Trump would not be able to respond to criticism by rival candidates in a debate.

“He has to speak Miss Manners while everyone else is throwing targets at him?”

The order has had a whirlwind trajectory through the courts since Chutkan imposed the order in response to a request from prosecutors, who cited among other comments Trump’s repeated disparagement of Smith as “deranged.”

The judge lifted it days after entering it, giving Trump’s lawyers time to prove why his words should not be restricted. But after Trump took advantage of that pause with comments that prosecutors said were meant to sway his former chief of staff against giving unfavourable testimony, Chutkan put it back in place.

Pillard and Millett are appointees of former president Barack Obama. Garcia joined the bench earlier this year after being nominated by US President Joe Biden. Obama and Biden are Democrats.

The four-count indictment against Trump in Washington is one of four criminal cases he faces as he seeks to reclaim the White House in 2024. The case is set for trial next March 4.

He has been charged in Florida, also by Smith’s team, with illegally hoarding classified documents at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Palm Beach, Florida. He has also been charged in state court in New York in connection with hush money payments to porn actor Stormy Daniels, who alleged an extramarital affair with him, and in Georgia with working to subvert the 2020 presidential election in that state.

Don't be surprised if Donald Trump's gag order in the federal election interference case is reimposed but narrowed in some way, if Monday's oral argument is any indication. While the three-judge federal appeals court panel in Washington sounded frustrated with the presentation by Trump's lawyer, it didn't seem fully satisfied with the government's approach, either.

Trump lawyer John Sauer didn't want to give an inch during his argument that restrictions on his client violated political speech rights under the First Amendment as Trump runs for office again. But Sauer's stubborn position left it unclear what a court could prohibit under a gag order that isn't already illegal.

Yet, the judges didn't sound completely assured by the argument from Justice Department lawyer Cecil VanDevender, including over what exactly Trump can say about special counsel Jack Smith, his staff and witnesses in the case.

As often happens in appellate proceedings, the panel was looking for where to draw the line, mindful of both the First Amendment and the considerations that led U.S. District Judge Tanya Chutkan to impose the order following Trump's history of menacing comments ahead of his scheduled March trial. He has pleaded not guilty to the indictment that accuses him of criminally plotting to overturn the 2020 election he lost to President Joe Biden. All three judges on the appellate panel were appointed by Democratic presidents -- one by Biden and two by Barack Obama.

If the panel is inclined to reimpose the order but in a more limited way, one open question is whether the judges specify the contours of their preferred order in their forthcoming opinion, or whether they send the matter back to Chutkan to formulate a new order based on the panel's ruling. Whatever the panel decides, further appeals to the Supreme Court may come.

In the meantime, the gag order in Washington is on hold, as is the order limiting Trump's statements about court staff in his ongoing civil fraud trial in New York.","{'uri': 'msnbc.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'MSNBC.com'}",[],"https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_nbcnews-fp-1024-512,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2023-11/231120-donald-trump-se-1241p-d6ecd2.jpg",eng-9078152,-0.3647058823529412,25,25,MSNBC.com,msnbc.com

The Foreign Secretary sought to reassure anxious Tory MPs of his stance on the controversial European Court of Human Rights.

Sources said he stressed the importance of punching on with Rishi Sunak's new plan for emergency legislation and a new treaty - and then take on Strasbourg if pushed.

The ex-PM even slapped down his close pal George Osborne for suggesting he was soft on the issue - saying his former Chancellor does not know his views on the subject too well.

Newly enobled Lord Cameron was grilled this evening at a packed meeting of the Conservative 1922 committee.

Sources at the gathering told The Sun his opening remarks stressed the importance of stopping the boats - a totemic issue for many Tories.

They said the ex-PM insisted he had first-hand experience with the European Court of Human Rights and knew what a pain it could be.

Lord Cameron cited his own battle in stripping prisoners of voting rights, an ECHR no-no which he continued to defy as PM.

Last week Mr Osborne said bringing the former PM back into government signalled that leaving the ECHR - demanded by some Tories - was off the table given his stance.

Many other Tory MPs including sacked Home Secretary Suella Braverman want Mr Sunak to go further by disapplying all ECHR or Human Rights Act laws in migration policy.

Immigration Minister Robert Jenrick is also said to be pushing this idea privately but has received pushback from Cabinet colleagues.

Supreme Court judges tore the Rwanda plan apart last week because it violated several international treaties as well as domestic law.

The PM scrambled to salvage the policy - which has already cost £140million - by announcing new laws to declare the East African nation ""safe"" so domestic courts will throw out appeals.

Today Government lawyer Lord Pannick was spotted clutching a draft of the new Removal to Rwanda Bill.

The grainy picture appeared to show reference to the Human Rights Act, sparking speculation Mr Sunak could be poised to disapply parts of it.

Mr Sunak also vowed to ignore ECHR so-called ""pyjama injunctions"" where anonymous Strasbourg judges scupper removal flights at the last minute.

Lord Cameron likened his address to Tory MPs tonight as ""a bit like going back to school"" and got a rapturous reception from backbenchers.

The judges picked apart Judge Tanya Chutkan's order, which prohibits Trump from targeting court personnel and witnesses, following his repeated attacks on Special Counsel Jack Smith. But they also acknowledged the difficulty of managing the case, asking whether the former president could use social media to in effect tell a witness 'don't act treasonously - don't cooperate' as a form of intimidation.

Trump's lawyer raised repeated concerns that the order would infringe on the former president's First Amendment rights, and members of the three-judge panel who are considering it weighed in with some of their misgivings while asking questions about who the former president could go after and under what circumstances. 'Is slimy liar inflammatory'? asked Judge Patricia Millet.

She asked a series of hypothetical questions to Cecil VanDevender, who argued on behalf of government prosecutors. 'I understand that he hasn't participated in debates thus far,' said Millet, who then proposed a hypothetical where Trump did appear on stage, and political rivals went after him for his repeated prosecutions (Trump is facing 91 charges in four criminal indictments). She asked why Trump couldn't respond by telling them it was all a 'political vendetta' by prosecutors who were 'doing the bidding of Joe Biden,' making a point of observing that 'I'm not saying everything's true here' in the hypothetical.

'He can't stand on the stage and say that?' the judge wanted to know. 'He has to speak Miss Manners while everyone else is throwing targets at him.' She also asked about what things Trump could and couldn't say, and whether it constituted disallowed 'targeting' versus allowable venting and protestations of his innocence. 'Is slimy liar inflammatory?' she wanted to know.

The judges revealed a keen interest in balancing the defendant's free speech rights with the government's interest in preserving a fair trial where witnesses come forward to speak truthfully and court personnel aren't subject to threats or harassment. The Justice Department cited a series of inflammatory Trump's both in recent months and during a period around his 2020 election overturn effort. 'I don't hear you giving any weight at all to the interests in a fair trial. Am I right that you don't?' Judge Cornelia Pillard asked Trump lawyer D. John Sauer.

The government conceded that Special Counsel Jack Smith, who Trump regularly calls 'deranged,' is a special case, as both a prominent representative of the government and a court personnel participant. But that raised the question, posed by judges, of whether Trump would be free to attack lower profile 'line prosecutors' in the case. The matter is more than academic after Trump faced a different gag order in his New York fraud case after going after Judge Arthur Engoron's chief clerk.

Her debate scenario (still hypothetical since Trump has been sitting them out while his Republican rivals mostly lay off him and attack each other) verged toward absurdity when Judge Millet asked questions about whether Trump could simply inveigh generally versus calling an individual a liar. 'But he can't say they're a liar?' she asked. VanDevender said he would be free to avoid a direct attack, and instead say 'what he said was untrue, and here's why.'

Then she asked if Trump could say someone was an 'untruth speaker?' All three judges are either Barack Obama or Joe Biden appointees, although the matter could get appealed to the Supreme Court if it goes against Trump.

Closely watched disputes in Colorado, Minnesota and Michigan have been dismissed by judges there, but voters seeking Trump's removal from the primary and general election ballots under Section 3 of the 14th Amendment have vowed to continue their fights, raising the possibility with each stage of proceedings that the Supreme Court will be asked to intervene.

""We are in uncharted waters. It's very unpredictable,"" Eric Segall, a law professor at Georgia State University, told CBS News. ""Whatever happens in state court, the Supreme Court, and on the actual merits of this and the procedures we're using, we're not finding the law, we're not interpreting the law, we are creating the law.""

Known as the disqualification clause, Section 3 of the 14th Amendment states that no person shall hold office if they have ""previously taken an oath as a member of Congress, or as an officer of the United States"" and engaged in insurrection or rebellion against the Constitution.

The clause was enacted in 1868, in the wake of the Civil War, to keep former Confederate civil and military officeholders from holding state or federal office again, and was largely forgotten until the Jan. 6, 2021, assault on the U.S. Capitol.

In the wake of the Jan. 6 attack, when a mob of Trump's supporters breached the U.S. Capitol in an attempt to stop Congress from tallying state electoral votes, groups of voters in Georgia and North Carolina argued that GOP Reps. Marjorie Taylor Greene and Madison Cawthorn were ineligible to run for reelection under Section 3.

An administrative law judge in Georgia found there was not enough evidence that Greene engaged in insurrection and should be kept off the ballot there, while Cawthorn's defeat in his primary ended the challenge to his eligibility.

But in New Mexico, a state court judge ruled that a county commissioner had to be removed from his post and is barred from holding any federal or state office under Section 3 because of his participation in the Jan. 6 riot.

Though the cases did not involve Trump, and Section 3 has never been invoked against a former president, they set important legal precedent, said Ron Fein, legal director of Free Speech For People, which brought the case against Cawthron.

""All three of these are important legal building blocks and precedents that we continue to cite in our case and [Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington] cites in Colorado and that help establish the legal framework that we're arguing in this case against Trump,"" Fein told CBS News.

Free Speech For People filed the legal challenges to Trump's candidacy in Michigan and Minnesota on behalf of voters in those states and is asking courts to block their secretaries of state from putting Trump on the 2024 GOP primary and general election ballots.

""We cannot allow our democracy to be extorted by threats of violence by unsuccessful political candidates like Trump,"" Fein said. ""And the lesson that the framers of the 14th Amendment learned at the price of hundreds of thousands of lives was that someone who took an oath to support the Constitution and broke that oath and engaged in insurrection is too dangerous for public office because if they are allowed back into office, they will do the same or worse.""

Cases brought by voters and advocacy groups that seek to disqualify Trump from running in 2024 have been brought in more than half of the states, including the cases that have gone to court in Colorado, Michigan and Minnesota, according to a compilation from Lawfare.

In Colorado, a state court judge in Denver said in a ruling Friday that Section 3 does not apply to Trump and ordered him to be placed on the presidential primary ballot. Judge Sarah Wallace wrote in her 102-page decision that Trump ""incited an insurrection on January 6, 2021 and therefore 'engaged' in insurrection within the meaning of Section Three of the Fourteenth Amendment"" -- the first time a court has ever made such a finding -- but she said was ""unpersuaded"" that Section 3 applies to the president under the phrase ""officers of the United States.""

In Minnesota, the state supreme court tossed out a case seeking to keep Trump off the ballot for the Republican primary because it is an ""internal party election to serve internal party purposes,"" but said Minnesota voters could pursue their case after the state's March 5 primary as to the general election ballot.

And in Michigan, a judge on the state Court of Claims ruled last week that the arguments from voters there present a political question that bars consideration by the courts ""at this time,"" and dismissed the suit.

Voters in Michigan appealed the decision Friday and are seeking immediate review by the Michigan Supreme Court. Meanwhile, Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, which is behind the Colorado suit, said it will file an appeal with the Colorado Supreme Court ""shortly.""

The cases raise questions that have been a subject of debate by legal scholars in panel discussions, op-eds and law review articles -- namely whether Jan. 6 was an ""insurrection,"" whether Trump engaged in insurrection and whether the presidency is among the offices covered by Section 3.

Wallace, the Colorado judge, wrote in her ruling that it appears the ""drafters of the Section Three of the Fourteenth Amendment did not intend to include the president as 'an officer of the United States,'"" and concluded that it does not apply to Trump.

As the proceedings make their way through the courts, legal scholars generally agree that if even one state high court rules that Trump is disqualified from running for office and orders him removed from the ballot, the former president will appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court, thrusting the nation's highest court into the center of a politically charged issue amid the 2024 campaign.

""If some jurisdictions start disqualifying him, the Supreme Court needs to weigh in,"" said Richard Hasen, an expert in election law and law professor at the University of California, Los Angeles. ""My dog in this fight is for finality.""

There are several issues that could give the Supreme Court an off-ramp to not deciding the merits of a case involving whether Trump is ineligible for office, but Hasen stressed that a definitive ruling from the justices would be in the nation's interest.

""We're going to be in a bad situation politically if this hangs over the election and people don't know if they're voting for a candidate who is not allowed to even hold office,"" he said.

Because elections in the U.S. are run by the states, legal experts predicted that there could be a situation where Trump's name is excluded from the ballot in one state -- if its high court rules he cannot hold office under Section 3 and that decision remains in force -- but listed on the ballot in another.

""On the one hand, that would be very unusual to have a major party candidate who's not on the ballot,"" said Press Millen, a trial attorney who represented the voters challenging Cawthorn's candidacy. ""But on the other hand, if you look at down-ballot races, it's not at all atypical.""

In the 2012 Republican presidential primary in Virginia, for example, candidates Newt Gingrich, Rick Santorum, Rick Perry and Jon Huntsman did not appear on the ballot, and there have been instances where the names of third-party candidates have been left off ballots in some states for general elections, such as Kanye West in Virginia, Arizona and Wisconsin in 2020.

""A state has a legitimate interest in excluding an ineligible candidate from the general election ballot, if it has to be resolved at that stage,"" Fein said.

He noted, though, that it's preferable for the issue of Trump's eligibility to be resolved at the primary stage so GOP primary voters can choose from candidates who are constitutionally eligible to hold office.

If Trump is kept off the ballot in a state, the former president could launch a write-in campaign, though the rules for doing so differ by state.

""But the big picture is that even if he amassed a majority of votes through a write-in campaign, he would continue to be ineligible to appear on the general election ballot, and it's not a way to evade the requirements of the Constitution,"" Fein said.","{'uri': 'cbsnews.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'CBS News'}",[],https://assets2.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2023/11/20/f5962ec0-7f19-441b-8821-5bf32ff2df62/thumbnail/1200x630g2/d59b323f6c9f7ff0de92d68cc48a0f5d/gettyimages-1790161182.jpg?v=5659e73acd91751548aa89950cf015b0,eng-9075414,0.1137254901960785,25,25,CBS News,cbsnews.com

(KDKA) -- The owner of a Westmoreland County gun store is facing charges after an investigation into her business sales, the district attorney's office said.

Tracey McMahan is facing multiple charges after the Westmoreland County District Attorney's Office said one customer paid her thousands of dollars for a gun that was never received and another tried to sell a shotgun but never got the money for it.

The district attorney's office said the investigation into McMahan, who owns Hi Grade Shooting Supply, began after a victim contacted Westmoreland County detectives in October.

According to investigators, the victim paid McMahan $4,600 to buy a combo shotgun through her business but the customer never got the gun or a refund. McMahan allegedly provided excuses, saying the firearm was lost in shipping or damaged before she stopped communicating, the district attorney's office said.

A second victim who tried to sell a firearm through Hi Grade Shooters Supply reported a similar situation to detectives.

The district attorney's office said the second victim tried to sell a Beretta shotgun to McMahan's business on consignment for $3,500 but never received the funds.

McMahan was charged with several counts of theft and receiving stolen property. The Westmoreland County District Attorney's Office said she's facing additional charges filed by Pennsylvania State Police. Court documents show she was also charged with theft by deception.

She was arraigned and released on $50,000 unsecured bond, the district attorney's office said.","{'uri': 'cbsnews.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'CBS News'}",[],https://assets3.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2021/12/10/ad507255-f1ed-4f28-9fc9-b7dcb8fdc9b2/thumbnail/1200x630/9c5032a913dafe0a2b96ed561a259033/GettyImages-1327894263.jpg?v=5659e73acd91751548aa89950cf015b0,,-0.3490196078431372,25,25,CBS News,cbsnews.com

(AP) - Michigan Democrats who have transformed gun laws in the state in the wake of multiple mass school shootings are now making it more difficult for individuals with convictions for misdemeanor domestic violence from gaining access to guns.

Gov. Gretchen Whitmer signed legislation Monday that prohibits individuals convicted of a misdemeanor related to domestic violence from possessing firearms for at least an eight-year-period. State law currently includes firearm restrictions for those with felonies related to domestic abuse, but no law had existed for misdemeanor domestic violence.

""These bills are based on a simple idea: if you have been found guilty in court for violently assaulting your partner, you should not be able to access a deadly weapon that you could use to further threatened, harm or kill them."" Whitmer said at a bill signing in Kalamazoo. ""It's just common sense.""

The eight-year ban for misdemeanor domestic violence convictions is only the latest firearm restriction added to Michigan law since Democrats took control of both chambers of the state Legislature and retained the governor's office last election.

Legislation implementing red flag laws, stricter background checks and safe storage requirements were all signed by Whitmer earlier this year. The overhauled gun laws follow two deadly mass school shootings that happened in Michigan within a 14-month period.

Democratic State Sen. Stephanie Chang, a lead sponsor of the bill package, said Monday that the latest legislation would put Michigan in line with similar laws in 31 other states and the District of Columbia.

Federal law already prohibits those charged with felonies or misdemeanors related to domestic violence from purchasing or possessing a gun. But advocates have pushed for state-level laws that they say can be better enforced and won't be threatened by future Supreme Court rulings.

Earlier this month, the Supreme Court took up a challenge to a federal law that prohibits people from having guns if they are under a court order to stay away from their spouse, partner or other family members. The nation's high court heard arguments on Nov. 7 and seemed likely to preserve the federal law.

""As the Supreme Court weighs whether to uphold common-sense laws to disarm domestic abusers, Governor Whitmer and the Michigan legislature are taking a clear stand: If you have a history of intimate partner violence, you have no business owning a gun,"" John Feinblatt, president of Everytown for Gun Safety, said in a statement.

Firearms are the most common weapon used in homicides of spouses, intimate partners, children or relatives in recent years, according to data from the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Guns were used in more than half, 57%, of those killings in 2020, a year that saw an overall increase in domestic violence during the coronavirus pandemic.

Under the legislation signed Monday in Michigan, people convicted of a misdemeanor that involved domestic violence will be not allowed to purchase, possess, or use a firearm or ammunition until they have completed the terms of imprisonment, paid all fines and eight years had passed.

The parents of Maggie Wardle, a 19-year-old shot and killed by an ex-boyfriend at Kalamazoo College in 1999, spoke in support of the legislation at Monday's signing.

""This law, now passed and signed into law today, will save someone´s life and give them the chance to live a full meaningful life, the chance Maggie did not get,"" Rick Omillian, Maggie´s stepfather, said Monday.","{'uri': 'dailymail.co.uk', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'Daily Mail Online'}",[],https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2023/11/20/19/wire-78033093-1700508369-448_636x382.jpg,eng-9078389,-0.403921568627451,25,25,Daily Mail Online,dailymail.co.uk

A gag order against former President Donald Trump in a federal election interference case is being weighed by a three-judge panel after they heard arguments in a federal appeals court in Washington, D.C., on Monday.

During the two-and-a-half hours of arguments, the appeals court judges appeared skeptical of both sides on whether to reinstate an order from a trial judge that prevented Trump from making inflammatory comments against prosecutors, potential witnesses and court staff.

Cecil VanDevender, a lawyer with Special Counsel Jack Smith's office, argued that a gag order is necessary to prevent intimidation and threats against participants in the case where Trump is accused of scheming to overturn the 2020 election.

Meanwhile, Trump lawyer John Sauer urged the court to revoke the order.

The court did not immediately rule, but the outcome of Monday's arguments will set parameters on what Trump, as both a criminal defendant and the leading candidate for the 2024 Republican presidential nomination, can and cannot say as the trial date nears.

The judges hearing the case include Cornelia Pillard and Patricia Millett, both appointees of former President Barack Obama, and Brad Garcia, who joined the bench earlier this year after being nominated by President Biden.

U.S. District Judge Tanya Chutkan first imposed the partial gag order Oct. 17, blocking Trump from making statements targeting Smith, his staff, witnesses and court personnel.

The order was later put on hold pending a previous appeal from the former president before being reinstated by Chutkan on Oct. 29.

The order does not prevent Trump from airing general complaints about the case, and Chutkan has said the former president is still allowed to assert his claims of innocence and that the case is politically motivated.

Trump has continued to deny any wrongdoing in the case, and has argued that it is part of an effort to prevent him from winning the presidency in 2024. He has also sharply criticized those involved in the case, including Smith, whom he often refers to as ""deranged.""

A panel of judges in a federal appeals court said Monday that only the federal government -- not citizens and groups -- can sue under a key part of the Voting Rights Act, effectively gutting the legislation in seven states.

The ruling, which applies to Arkansas, Iowa, Minnesota, Missouri, Nebraska, North Dakota and South Dakota, found that only the U.S. attorney general is able to bring a suit under Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act.

The vast majority of Voting Rights Act claims are brought by private citizens and civil rights groups, who foot the bill for time-consuming litigation to protect voting rights. The Department of Justice, with limited staff and resources, typically brings just a small fraction of the cases fought nationally.

It is sure to be challenged -- likely to the U.S. Supreme Court -- which has limited the voting law's power significantly over the last decade.

""If this ruling were allowed to stand, it would decimate the Voting Rights Act,"" Rick Hasen, an election law expert at the UCLA School of Law, said.

The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit ruled Monday that the Arkansas State Conference NAACP and the Arkansas Public Policy Panel could not challenge redistricting maps in Arkansas because Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act does not provide a ""private right of action.""

The groups had sought to challenge Arkansas lawmakers' redistricting in the state, where a Republican-controlled legislature drew eleven majority-Black districts in the state's 100-seat House of Representatives. The state is 16% Black.

The ruling, affirming a lower court's dismissal of the case, goes against decades of precedent where judges have assumed or specifically affirmed a private right of action under the Voting Rights Act.

""Since the original Arkansas opinion came down, I think there have been 15 decisions by other courts around the country about whether Section 2 includes a private right of action and all but one of held like, of course it does,"" said Michael Li, a redistricting expert at the Brennan Center for Justice.

Li said he believes the ruling will be overturned on appeal, but it is currently the law of the land in seven states.

In addition to blocking the Arkansas groups from seeking additional voting rights for Black voters there, the ruling will overturn a recent win for Native American voters in North Dakota. A federal judge ruled last week that North Dakota state lawmakers had diluted two Native American tribes' voting rights, violating Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act. Lawmakers were due to redraw state legislative maps before the end of the year.","{'uri': 'nbcnews.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'NBC News'}",[],"https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_nbcnews-fp-1024-512,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2023-11/231120-voters-election-se-1255p-51db7c.jpg",eng-9078082,0.1607843137254903,25,25,NBC News,nbcnews.com

""He has to speak 'Miss Manners' while everyone else is throwing targets at him?"" Millett said skeptically during a two-hour oral argument at the federal courthouse in Washington. ""It would be really hard in a debate, when everyone else is going at you full bore. Your attorneys would have to have scripted little things you can say.""

""It's not how I want my children to speak,"" Millett added of Trump's rhetoric, ""but that's really not the question.""

Another appeals judge, Nina Pillard, suggested on at least five occasions that the trial judge's order goes too far by appearing to bar Trump from making hostile comments about individuals in the public eye who could be witnesses in the case.

Pillard said she doubted figures like former Vice President Mike Pence, former Attorney General Bill Barr or former Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman Mark Milley were likely to change their stories based on Trump's invective -- or even based on more direct threats or attacks that might flow from them.

""I would assume that their testimony would not be affected,"" said Pillard, also an Obama appointee.

Despite the panel's concerns with the breadth of the gag order, imposed last month by U.S. District Court Tanya Chutkan, the appeals judges nevertheless seemed prepared to endorse a narrower version of it, agreeing with prosecutors that Trump shouldn't have carte blanche to make statements that could intimidate witnesses or threaten the integrity of the proceedings.

""We have to use a careful scalpel here,"" Millett said.

It's unclear whether the appeals court panel intends to rewrite the gag order itself or send it back to Chutkan with new instructions. The timeline for action is also unclear. The panel took up the case on an emergency basis, but it often takes weeks or months for an appeals court panel to rule on complex issues of law. And the panel is likely not the final word: The losing side may appeal the panel's decision to the full bench of the appeals court or the Supreme Court.

Both Millett and Pillard suggested that Trump's attorneys gave too little weight to Chutkan's responsibility to protect the trial. And the appeals panel's third judge, Bradley Garcia, an appointee of President Joe Biden, noted that Chutkan had issued the gag order after holding a detailed hearing on the matter and gathering voluminous facts to support her decision.

Chutkan issued the order on Oct. 16, but it's not currently in effect because the appeals court panel suspended it while the panel considers the matter.

Chutkan imposed the gag order to constrain Trump's inflammatory rhetoric, saying his attacks on prosecutors and potential witnesses posed a threat to the ""administration of justice"" and risked stoking threats against people involved in the case. Trump is set to go on trial March 4 on charges that he committed multiple conspiracies to derail the transfer of power in a bid to remain president despite losing the 2020 election.

On Monday, at a federal courthouse steps from the Capitol, special counsel Jack Smith -- under guard by deputy U.S. marshals -- watched as one of his prosecutors, Cecil VanDevender, argued for the reinstatement of the gag order.

In her order, Chutkan barred Trump from ""targeting"" potential witnesses or referencing the subject of their testimony. She also forbade Trump from going after prosecutors by name, while permitting him to make broader attacks on the Biden administration and the Justice Department. And the Obama-appointed judge also barred Trump from attacking court personnel.

After the panel suspended the gag order while it hears Trump's appeal, Trump used the interim to resume his attacks on Smith's team -- and even on Smith's family members -- as well as potential witnesses.

Pillard seemed to concur with Trump lawyers' arguments that language in the gag order prohibiting their client from ""targeting"" prosecutors, jurors and witnesses was vague.

""'Targeting' does raise a little bit of unclarity,"" she said.

The appeals court judges sharply criticized Trump's position that virtually any restriction on his ability to discuss the case publicly would be a violation of his First Amendment free speech rights. But they seemed at times to be equally confounded by prosecutors' efforts to draw lines about which aspects of Trump's speech were acceptable and which weren't.

At one point, to the judges' consternation, VanDevender said Trump's description of a prospective witness as a ""liar"" would be impermissible, but he could describe the same witness as someone who tells ""untruths.""

""I know that's a little bit of a fine line,"" VanDevender said.

The judges also seemed perplexed by the order's prohibition on statements that target Smith himself -- or even the line prosecutors who work for him. Many of those attorneys may be public figures in their own right and represent the government the same way Smith does, they noted.

In an apparent concession, VanDevender told the judges that Smith was not asking to be personally protected from criticism by Trump.

The judges didn't dwell on the question of whether it's proper to consider Trump's political role when making decisions related to his criminal case, but Millett pressed Trump's attorney, John Sauer, about whether he would be making these arguments if Trump were not a candidate for president.

""It's still unconstitutional,"" Sauer said of the gag order. ""The campaign adds an additional, but still-powerful, reason.""

On several occasions during Monday's arguments in the large ceremonial courtroom, Millett raised her voice in frustration at lawyers for both sides. She also briefly buried her head in her hands late in the court session.

Prosecutors cast the gag order as an urgent constraint on Trump's ability to intimidate or threaten witnesses. They say he knowingly stokes violent supporters to act against his perceived adversaries and has overtly attempted to silence key witnesses like his former White House chief of staff, Mark Meadows -- messages that could also chill the testimony of less powerful figures.

They cited his August social media post -- ""If you go after me, I'm coming after you"" -- as well as his targeted attacks on Meadows, Pence and Milley, all potential witnesses in the case. In September, Trump accused Milley of treatson and said he would have been put to death in an earlier era.

Trump also repeatedly casts Smith as ""deranged"" and has attacked specific prosecutors in his office.

Chutkan's directive is separate from a gag order a New York state judge issued against Trump last month, barring him from commenting publicly about the judge's principal law clerk or other court staff. That judge, Arthur Engoron, has been overseeing a lengthy bench trial in a civil case the New York attorney general filed targeting Trump's business empire over claims of pervasive fraud.

Last week, a state appeals court judge temporarily lifted the gag order there. Trump responded by quickly taking to his social media site to fire off a new salvo against Engoron and his clerk.","{'uri': 'politico.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'POLITICO'}",[],https://static.politico.com/3f/6b/e7dcc78f44e2ad9beb94f07f5646/https-delivery-gettyimages.com/downloads/1527386991,eng-9078152,-0.2941176470588235,25,25,POLITICO,politico.com

The New York Court of Appeals, in a unanimous decision, ruled that the law is clear in its language and that it does not conflict with an existing state law that bans police from using chokes.

The city's law came as governments across the country prohibited or severely limited the use of chokeholds or similar restraints by police following Floyd's death in 2020, which occurred as a Minneapolis police officer kneeled on his neck for several minutes.

The Police Benevolent Association of the City of New York, along with other law enforcement unions, sued the city over its law and have argued that its language is vague as to what officers are allowed to do during an arrest. In a statement, John Nuthall, a spokesman for the Police Benevolent Association of the City of New York, said the ruling will provide clarity to officers.

""While this is not the outcome we had hoped for, the Court´s decision is a victory insofar that it will provide our officers with greater certainty when it comes to the statute, because under this Court´s decision, it must be proven at a minimum that an officer´s action in fact 'impedes the person´s ability to breathe,´ was 'not accidental,´ and was not a 'justifiable use of physical force,´"" Nuthall said.

The New York Police Department has long barred its officers from using chokeholds to subdue people. New York state also has a law banning police chokeholds that was named after Eric Garner, who was killed when a New York Police Department officer placed him in a chokehold in 2014.

The city's law, while banning chokes, also includes a provision that forbids officers from compressing a person's diaphragm. Such a compression, though kneeling, sitting or standing on a person's chest or back, can make it difficult to breath.

Palestine Action activists will argue they had ""lawful justification"" to commit burglary and criminal damage against an Israeli defence company they wanted to shut down, a court has heard.

The eight defendants, including the group's co-founders, are charged with offences relating to a campaign to put Elbit Systems' UK arm ""out of business"".

Opening the prosecution case at Snaresbrook crown court in north-east London on Monday, Sally Hogan said the defendants, who are not all charged with each of the 13 counts, do not deny committing burglaries, causing damage to the outside of buildings, threatening Elbit's landlord, Jones Lang LaSalle, in order to put the company out of business nor possession of articles with intent to cause criminal damage, but claim they were entitled to do so in law.

She told the jury: ""They caused damage to property, damage that caused thousands of pounds. They went into buildings as trespassers with the intent of causing damage ... Why did they want to do that? They wanted to put Elbit out of business.

""They say what we did was with a lawful justification and that is the stark issue for you, members of the jury [to decide upon].""

Hogan said Palestine Action was a ""lawful protest group"", set up by Huda Ammori and Richard Barnard, who recruited the other defendants and other individuals to their organisation. She told the jury the prosecution case was that the pair ""in a sense directed to others about what they should do"". Hogan said Ammori and Barnard had posted online about what they were doing and ""why they said they were justified in taking the action they took"".

The prosecutor said that while there was a right to disagree and protest in the UK, the demonstrations by Palestine Action had crossed the line of what was allowed into unlawful protest and had not followed the rule of law.

She said: ""It won't have escaped your knowledge that there have been many protests recently but the prosecution say there are rules, there are laws to prevent offences being committed during the course of protests.""

The defendants - Ammori, Barnard, Caroline Brouard, Jocelyn Cooney, Robin Refualu, Genevieve Scherer, Nicola Deane and Emily Arnott - are all charged with encouraging people to commit criminal damage against Elbit, which they all deny in fact and in law. They have pleaded not guilty to all of the offences, which are said to have occurred between June 2020 and February 2021.","{'uri': 'theguardian.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","[{'uri': 'haroon_siddique@theguardian.com', 'name': 'Haroon Siddique', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': False}]",https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/79ce0651420c409cf15f3da152e8effa79612c84/0_383_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&s=d474a3d5e0ee4e82abcead81ec572ab3,,-0.4352941176470588,25,25,The Guardian,theguardian.com

The ABA's Council of the Section of Legal Education and Admission to the Bar voted Friday to gather public comments on proposed changes to its standards that would enable new and existing law schools with no physical campus to apply for accreditation.

Only law schools with brick-and-mortar locations are currently eligible for ABA accreditation. The ABA has allowed a growing number of those schools to offer fully or mostly online Juris Doctor programs alongside their residential ones, but fully online schools have remained ineligible to apply for the ABA's stamp of approval.

Daniel Thies, chairperson of the ABA Council's Strategic Review Committee, on Friday called the proposal to accredit online law schools a ""significant change"" that could help lower the cost of a legal education. He noted that online J.D. programs offered by ABA-accredited law schools generally charge the same tuition for online and residential students.

""Likely, that's because they're all offered by brick-and-mortar law schools that have all the same expenses associated with brick-and-mortar law schools,"" Thies said.

ABA accreditation would be a boon for the small cohort of existing online law schools because their graduates would be able to sit for the bar exam in any state. Currently only California offers the bar for graduates of non-ABA accredited law schools.

Thies suggested that some traditional law schools may object to the change for fear of added competition. But longstanding perceptions that distance education is lower quality than in-person teaching have diminished significantly following the rapid shift to online education during the COVID-19 pandemic, several ABA council members said Friday.

Purdue Global Law School is the oldest online law school -- it was founded in 1998 as the Concord Law School before its acquisition by Purdue in 2017. There are a handful of other fully online law schools scattered across the country.

Annual tuition for Purdue's part-time online J.D. program is about $13,500. By comparison, annual tuition for ABA-accredited Southwestern Law School's new fully online J.D. program is the same as its residential program -- $38,944 for part-time students.

""I am very happy to see that the ABA is finally considering moving in this direction,"" said Purdue Law Dean Martin Pritikin said Monday. ""Virtually every other field of higher education has been quicker to embrace online learning.""

Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com.

When Staff Sgt. Buck Aldridge fatally shot Leonard Cure during a roadside struggle after pulling him over for speeding, it wasn't the first time a traffic stop involving the Camden County sheriff's deputy had spiraled into violence.

Last year, Aldridge dragged a driver from a car that crashed after fleeing the deputy on Interstate 95. Body and dash camera video obtained by The Associated Press show the driver on his back as Aldridge punches him. Records indicate the deputy faced no disciplinary action.

Personnel records show Aldridge was fired in August 2017 by a police department in the same Georgia county after he threw a woman to the ground and handcuffed her during a traffic stop. The Camden County Sheriff's Office hired him nine months later.

Aldridge stopped Cure for speeding Oct. 16 and ended up shocking the 53-year-old Black man with a Taser after he refused to put his hands behind him to be cuffed. Body and dash camera videos show Cure fought back and had a hand at the deputy's throat when Aldridge shot him point-blank.

Relatives have said Cure likely resisted because of psychological trauma from spending 16 years imprisoned in Florida for an armed robbery he didn't commit. Officials exonerated and freed him in 2020.

The Georgia Bureau of Investigation is investigating Cure's death and will submit its findings to prosecutors. Aldridge's attorney said the video shows he fired in self-defense. Critics question whether he should have been wearing a badge at all, given his history of aggression.

""This guy should have never been on the force,"" said Timothy Bessent Sr., president of Camden County's NAACP chapter.

The AP obtained Aldridge's personnel records as well as reports and videos from the June 2022 chase and arrest using Georgia's open records law.

A former U.S. Marine, Aldridge, 41, worked nearly five years for the Kingsland Police Department in Georgia's southeast corner. His file shows Aldridge was disciplined for using unnecessary force in February 2014 and May 2017. The second time he was suspended for three days without pay.

The department fired Aldridge for his third infraction just three months later. Police records say Aldridge was assisting with a traffic stop when he tried to handcuff a woman -- not to arrest her, but to keep her outside her car. One deputy told investigators Aldridge cuffed the woman after ""picking her up and throwing her on the ground."" She was cited for letting an unlicensed person drive her car.

Aldridge was hired by the sheriff's office in May 2018. He disclosed his firing on his job application.

Aldridge's termination wouldn't automatically disqualify him from working for another agency, though some would consider it a huge liability, said retired police Maj. Neill Franklin.

""If someone's terminated from another police department for use of excessive force, they're not getting hired by the Maryland State Police or the Baltimore Police Department,"" said Franklin, who led training programs for both agencies. ""It's just not worth the risk.""

Bessent and other advocates say it's an example of Camden County Sheriff Jim Proctor tolerating unnecessary violence.

Proctor, who has been sheriff for a decade, declined to comment. Spokesman Capt. Larry Bruce cited the investigation into Cure's death and pending civil litigation involving other deputies.

Since last year, six Camden County deputies have been indicted on felony charges and fired for violence against jail detainees and a motorist.

In September 2022, jail security cameras recorded guards rushing into the cell of Jarrett Hobbs, who was punched in the head and neck and hurled against a wall. Hobbs was charged with assaulting jailers until his attorney obtained the video. His charges were dropped, and three deputies were indicted.

Two more jailers were charged and fired for incidents in March and July. Security video showed one push a detainee to the floor and punch him before another guard intervened. The other deputy shoved a handcuffed detainee headfirst into a door, knocking him unconscious.

""You've got these deputies running wild and doing what they want to do,"" said Harry Daniels, a civil rights attorney who won a legal settlement for Hobbs. ""The consequences have come from the GBI and the district attorney's office. It should not come from an outside agency.""

He points to Christine Newman, named ""Deputy of the Month"" two months after a dash camera recorded her slapping a handcuffed driver across the face and slamming the woman's head into a patrol SUV. The driver had refused to exit her vehicle after being pulled over for a rolling stop Jan. 16, 2022.

Newman was fired a year later after being indicted on charges including aggravated assault and violating her oath of office. She has pleaded not guilty. Newman's attorney, Robert Persse, called her a ""loyal deputy"" whom he looks forward to defending in court.

The number of deputies facing charges ""indicates a culture that may not encourage use of force, but certainly tolerates inappropriate use of force,"" said retired LaGrange, Georgia, Police Chief Louis Dekmar.

""If folks are held accountable and there are clear lines, you generally don't see that in law enforcement agencies,"" said Dekmar, a former president of the International Association of Chiefs of Police.

A spike in claims involving the sheriff's office caused Camden County's government to get dropped by its insurance company in July, said Mike Spiers, the county's risk management director. The county got new policies, he said, but its deductible for liability jumped from $25,000 per claim to $250,000.

Aldridge was placed on administrative leave while the GBI investigates Cure's death.

""Buck Aldridge is a fine officer and the video speaks for itself,"" said Adrienne Browning, Aldridge's attorney. ""It's clear his life was in danger and he defended himself.""

Video of the fatal confrontation along I-95 shows Aldridge telling Cure he's being charged with reckless driving for speeding in excess of 100 mph (161 kph). Cure argues, but obeys commands to get out and put his hands on his truck. However, he ignores commands to put his hands behind him.

That's when Aldridge fires his Taser into Cure's back. Cure fights back, and video shows them grappling beside the highway. Cure maintains a grip on Aldridge's face and neck after being struck with a baton.

""Yeah, bitch!"" Cure says. Then he slumps to the ground after Aldridge fires a single shot.

Dekmar, Franklin and a third expert told AP they believe the shooting was legal, as Aldridge appeared to be in danger when he fired. But they also criticized how Aldridge began the encounter by shouting at Cure and said he made no effort to deescalate.

""He escalated the situation with Mr. Cure,"" said former Memphis police officer Thaddeus Johnson, a criminal justice professor at Georgia State University and a senior fellow for the Council on Criminal Justice. ""He has no control over his emotions.""

Johnson said Aldridge showed a similar lack of control during a June 2022 arrest after chasing two speeding cars.

After one car crashes, body and dash camera video shows Aldridge shouting expletives as he approaches with his gun drawn. The driver is on his back when Aldridge starts dragging him headfirst from the car, then punches him.

The driver resists being cuffed but complies after another deputy's dog bites him and Aldridge shocks him with a Taser. The driver was charged with drug trafficking, reckless driving and fleeing an officer.

Aldridge was promoted to staff sergeant two months later. His sheriff's personnel file shows no disciplinary actions.

Johnson said he sees no justification for Aldridge punching the arrested driver. Even if prosecutors don't charge him in Cure's death, he said, ""from what I saw in the video, he deserves to be fired.""

""We have to hold officers to a higher standard,"" Johnson said, ""even though they are human.""","{'uri': 'foxnews.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'Fox News'}",[],https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2023/11/Camden-County-Sheriffs-Office.gif,eng-9076017,-0.2705882352941177,25,25,Fox News,foxnews.com

Michael Gove, the Levelling Up, Housing and Communities Secretary, had in July refused planning permission for the scheme on heritage and environmental grounds, overturning approval from the local council.

Stuart Machin, the CEO of M&amp;S, one of the best-known names in British business, called Gove's decision ""utterly pathetic"" and in August the retailer launched a legal challenge.

""We are pleased that the court has recognised the merits of our legal challenge on every one of the six counts that we raised, and approved our case to proceed to the next stage,"" Machin said in a statement.

""We have been clear from the very start that the refurbishment of the existing store was not possible, so this is only the first step in the lengthy process of overturning the government´s senseless decision.""

The Department for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities declined to comment.

Klain most recently was a partner at U.S. law firm O'Melveny & Myers since April. He rejoined the firm, where he worked earlier in his career, after holding the top advisor role in the White House until February.

He will join San Francisco-based Airbnb as chief legal officer on Jan. 1 and report to co-founder and CEO Brian Chesky, the company said.

""Ron is both a big-picture strategic thinker and a highly skilled operator, and I'm thrilled he'll be a close advisor,"" Chesky said in a statement.

In his most recent stint at O'Melveny, Klain was a member of the firm's executive committee and headed its strategic counseling and crisis management practice. The Los Angeles-founded firm has about 800 lawyers globally.

A longtime Democratic staffer, he was earlier chief of staff to former Vice President Al Gore and to Biden when he was vice president under President Barack Obama.

Klain said he had planned to be at O'Melveny indefinitely, but the opportunity to join Airbnb ""was impossible to pass up.""

O'Melveny chair Bradley Butwin said in a statement that the firm appreciates Klain's contributions and will continue to work closely with him as a client.

Klain will succeed Rich Baer, who joined Airbnb as legal chief in 2019 and announced his retirement last month, according to a company spokesperson.

Jay Carney, a former Amazon executive who previously served as White House press secretary to President Barack Obama and communications director to Biden when he was vice president, joined Airbnb as global head of policy and communications last year.

The judges picked apart Judge Tanya Chutkan's order, which prohibits Trump from targeting court personnel and witnesses, following his repeated attacks on Special Counsel Jack Smith. But they also acknowledged the difficulty of managing the case, asking whether the former president could use social media to in effect tell a witness 'don't act treasonously - don't cooperate' as a form of intimidation.

Trump's lawyer raised repeated concerns that the order would infringe on the former president's First Amendment rights, and members of the three-judge panel who are considering it weighed in with some of their own misgivings, while asking questions about who the former president could go after and under what circumstances.

'Is slimy liar inflammatory'? asked Judge Patricia Millet.

A federal appeals court is weighing a gag order that a district judge imposed on former President Donald Trump preventing him from targeting potential witnesses or court personnel in his January 6 case

She asked a series of hypothetical questions to Cecil VanDevender, who argued on behalf of government prosecutors.

'I understand that he hasn't participated in debates thus far,' said Millet, who then proposed a hypothetical where Trump did appear on stage, and political rivals went after him for his repeated prosecutions (Trump is facing 91 charges in four criminal indictments).

She asked why Trump couldn't respond by telling them it was all a 'political vendetta' by prosecutors who were 'doing the bidding of Joe Biden,' making a point of observing that 'I'm not saying everything's true here' in the hypothetical.

'He can't stand on the stage and say that?' the judge wanted to know.

'He has to speak Miss Manners while everyone else is throwing targets at him.'

She also asked about what things Trump could and couldn't say, and whether it constituted disallowed 'targeting' versus allowable venting and protestations of his innocence.

'Is slimy liar inflammatory?' she wanted to know.

Trump has repeatedly called Jack Smith 'deranged.' But could he call him a 'slimy liar' under the terms of a gag order?

Judge Tanya Chutkan imposed the order. The court must weigh free speech and fair trial issues

The judges revealed a keen interest in balancing the defendant's free speech rights with the government's interest in preserving a fair trial where witnesses come forward to speak truthfully and court personnel aren't subject to threats or harassment.

The Justice Department cited a series of inflammatory Trump's both in recent months and during a period around his 2020 election overturn effort.

'I don't hear you giving any weight at all to the interests in a fair trial. Am I right that you don't?' Judge Cornelia Pillard asked Trump lawyer D. John Sauer.

The government conceded that Special Counsel Jack Smith, who Trump regularly calls 'deranged,' is a special case, as both a prominent representative of the government and a court personnel participant.

But that raised the question, posed by judges, of whether Trump would be free to attack lower profile 'line prosecutors' in the case.

The matter is more than academic, after Trump faced a different gag order in his New York fraud case after going after Judge Arthur Engoron's chief clerk.

In her debate scenario (still hypothetical since Trump has been sitting them out while his Republican rivals mostly lay off him and attack each other) verged toward absurdity when Judge Millet asked questions about whether Trump could simply inveigh generally versus calling an individual a liar.

'But he can't say they're a liar?' she asked.

VanDevender said he would be free to avoid a direct attack, and instead say 'what he said was untrue and here's why.'

Then she asked if Trump could say someone was an 'untruth speaker?'

All three judges are either Barack Obama or Joe Biden appointees, although the matter could get appealed to the Supreme Court if it goes against Trump,.","{'uri': 'dailymail.co.uk', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'Daily Mail Online'}",[],https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2023/11/20/17/78029781-0-image-m-16_1700501540770.jpg,eng-9073936,-0.2313725490196078,25,25,Daily Mail Online,dailymail.co.uk

Democratic Gov. Janet Mills and Attorney General Aaron Frey have tasked the commission with performing a review of the events leading up to the Lewiston shootings and the response to it. Army reservist Robert Card, 40, killed 18 people in a bowling alley and a restaurant on Oct. 25 before dying of a self-inflicted gunshot wound.

The commission held its first meeting on Monday and members unanimously voted to request subpoena power from the Maine Legislature.

""We will be seeking military records, and those might not be accessible to us without subpoena power,"" said Toby Dilworth, a former assistant U.S. attorney for the District of Maine and a commission member. ""It's essential that we have this subpoena power.""

The commission is chaired by Daniel Wathen, former chief justice of the Maine Supreme Judicial Court. Other members include Debra Baeder, the former chief forensic psychologist for the state, and Paula Silsby, a former U.S. attorney for the District of Maine.

The panel is expected to investigate potential missed opportunities to prevent the shootings. Card was well known to law enforcement and fellow service members had raised flags about his behavior, mental health state and potential for violence before the shootings. Card spent two weeks in a psychiatric hospital in New York last summer after an altercation with other reserve members.

Mills and Frey swiftly released a statement that they supported the move to see subpoena power. Mills, who created the commission via executive order, has called on the commission to follow the facts of the case and keep them as transparent to the public as possible.

Mills and Frey said in their statement they would ""immediately begin consulting with the Independent Commission and legislative leadership to prepare legislation granting the commission the power of subpoena, with the goal of having that legislation prepared for the Legislature´s consideration at the beginning of the next session.""

The commission will meet again on Dec. 14, Wathen said. He said his goal was for the commission to produce a written report within six months, which was a timeline he called ""a very ambitious goal, but highly desirable for obvious reasons.""

The commission also took comments from the public on Monday. Rep. Suzanne Salisbury, a Westbrook Democrat, called on the commission to collaborate with law enforcement as it performs its review.

""I hope that law enforcement's voice can be heard and used as the experts they are,"" Salisbury said.

Late Friday afternoon, Colorado District Judge Sarah Wallace handed down her ruling in a case brought to challenge former President Donald Trump's eligibility to hold office again under Section 3 of the 14th Amendment. The case had several questions to answer, including whether this clause applied to Trump, whether he'd ""engaged"" in an insurrection and whether, as the plaintiffs in the case argued, the Colorado secretary of state should be required to keep him off the ballot.

The answers Wallace came to were stacked against Trump, including that ""Trump engaged in an insurrection on January 6, 2021 through incitement, and that the First Amendment does not protect Trump's speech."" Wallace nevertheless decided Trump was eligible for the ballot anyway, finding that the drafters of the 14th Amendment did not include the president as an ""officer"" of the United States. The resulting victory for Trump, ordering an insurrectionist to be placed on the ballot, threatens the future of democracy on the most confounding of technicalities.

The so-called insurrection clause of the 14th Amendment targets anyone who swore an oath ""as a member of Congress, or as an officer of the United States, or as a member of any State legislature, or as an executive or judicial officer of any State, to support the Constitution of the United States."" If, after swearing that oath, that person ""engaged in insurrection or rebellion against the same, or given aid or comfort to the enemies thereof,"" then they are barred from being ""Senator or Representative in Congress, or elector of President and Vice-President,"" or holding ""any office, civil or military"" at the state or federal levels. Both parts of that construction are important, as we'll get into later.

In her ruling, Wallace walked through each of the hurdles that could trip up the case and found that the petitioners -- a group of Republican and unaffiliated voters -- had cleared almost all of them. Unlike states like Michigan, state law in Colorado specifically gives the secretary of state the power to determine whether a candidate is qualified for the role in question. And past secretaries of state have kept people off the ballot for any number of reasons, clearly setting a precedent for doing the same with Trump.

Wallace agreed with testimony given during the two-week trial that the 14th Amendment's insurrection clause didn't only apply to those who took part in the Civil War and that a law later passed by Congress didn't negate its effect. She also ruled that the House Jan. 6th Committee's findings, which Trump-friendly witnesses attacked as a political hit job, were relevant and credible. Accordingly, she found that the Jan. 6, 2021 attack on the Capitol ""easily satisfy"" the definition of an insurrection as used in the 14th Amendment.

As for whether Trump ""engaged"" in an insurrection, Wallace rejected his defense that his statements leading up to storming the Capitol were protected speech under the First Amendment. While she rejected the petitioners' argument that Trump's inaction to stop the attack sooner was disqualifying in and of itself, she found it did help prove his intent. ""Engagement under Section Three of the Fourteenth Amendment includes incitement to insurrection,"" she concluded, and Trump's actions fit the bill.

In the last few pages of the 102-page decision, though, Wallace turned toward whether the clause applies specifically to Trump as a former president. And that's where everything falls apart.

Wallace ruled that it's both unclear from the amendment's phrasing whether the presidency is an ""office...under the United States"" that someone could be blocked from holding, or whether ""Trump took an oath as 'an officer of the United States'"" when he became president.

It's a stance that left me gobsmacked when I first read it because it may be the finest splitting of hairs that I've ever seen in so crucial a ruling. For example, Wallace buys the Trump team's arguments that ""Section Three specifies that the disqualifying oath is one to 'support' the Constitution whereas the Presidential oath is to 'preserve, protect and defend' the Constitution."" She also accepts the team's claim that an earlier draft of the amendment which included the president and vice president instead of ""officers"" meant that the two roles were deliberately excluded from the final version's intended effects.

Let's go ahead and say for a second that the drafters of the amendment didn't specifically have former presidents in mind when listing people who had sworn to protect the Constitution. It may have been entirely unthinkable that such a person could engage in insurrection -- but to refute that the president is, as expert testimony during the trial stated, an officer of the United States defies reason. Especially when that refutation is based on the idea that the term is too broad to include the presidency.

In finding the narrowest possible justification for ruling that Trump isn't disqualified, Wallace refused to stick her neck out ahead of the other courts that have either punted on the decision until later or claiming that it's Congress that needs to make the final call. In the second to last paragraph, she even concedes the ruling was influenced by her ""reluctance to embrace an interpretation which would disqualify a presidential candidate without a clear, unmistakable indication that such is the intent of Section Three.""

Yes, it's true that Trump is an anomaly in many ways. His attempt to stay in the White House after losing the 2020 election has raised a number of questions that our political and legal systems have never had to answer. But as the Justice Department said in a recent court filing, he stands ""stands alone in American history for his alleged crimes. No other president has engaged in conspiracy and obstruction to overturn valid election results and illegitimately retain power."" And while he has not been convicted in either the federal election interference case or the one brought in Georgia, his well-established efforts to overturn a lawful election and prevent the peaceful transfer of power cannot and should not be underemphasized in these rulings.

I didn't expect every case being filed against Trump's qualifications to be a slam dunk victory for the plaintiffs. There were always going to be enough competing rulings that the question would reach the Supreme Court. I am also glad that there is now at the very least a legal determination that Trump met the higher bar of ""engaging"" in insurrection in 2021. But I am surprised, and disappointed, by how hard judges and other officials have scrambled to find even the slightest plausible loophole to avoid holding Trump accountable.","{'uri': 'msnbc.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'MSNBC.com'}",[],"https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_nbcnews-fp-1024-512,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2023-11/231120-donald-trump-jm-1032-ea678f.jpg",eng-9075414,0.08235294117647052,25,25,MSNBC.com,msnbc.com

Apple's agreements limit ""feature competition"" within peer-to-peer payment apps, including prohibiting existing or new platforms from using ""decentralized cryptocurrency technology,"" the complaint said.

Lawyers for the former US president Donald Trump urged a federal appeals court on Monday to revoke a gag order in the federal case charging him with plotting to overturn the results of the 2020 presidential election.

""The order is unprecedented and it sets a terrible precedent for future restrictions on core political speech,"" Trump's attorney John Sauer told a three-judge panel.

Prosecutors with the special counsel Jack Smith's team, meanwhile, are urging the court to put back in place an order barring Trump from making inflammatory statements about potential witnesses and lawyers in the case.

The prosecutors say those restrictions are necessary to prevent Trump from undermining confidence in the court system and intimidating people who may be called to testify against him.

Defense lawyers call the gag order an unconstitutional muzzling of Trump's free speech rights and say prosecutors have presented no evidence to support the idea that his words have caused harm or made anyone feel threatened.

During arguments on Monday, Sauer called the gag order a ""heckler's veto"", unfairly relying on the theory that Trump's speech might someday inspire other people to harass or intimidate his targets.

The three judges appeared skeptical of Sauer's arguments that the gag order was unconstitutional or had been entered without sufficient cause.

Judge Brad Garcia pressed Sauer to explain why the court ccould not take steps now before threats against those involved proliferate.

""This is predictably going to intensify as well as the threats, so why isn't the district court justified in taking a more proactive measure and not waiting for more and more threats to occur and stepping in to protect the integrity of the trial?"" he asked.

The gag order is one of multiple contentious issues being argued ahead of the landmark March 2024 trial. Defense lawyers are also trying to get the case dismissed by arguing that Trump, as a former president, is immune from prosecution and protected by the first amendment from being charged.

The outcome of Monday's arguments will not affect those constitutional claims, but it will set parameters on what Trump as both a criminal defendant and leading presidential candidate can and cannot say as the trial date nears.

The order has had a whirlwind trajectory through the courts since the US district judge Tanya Chutkan imposed it last month in response to a request from prosecutors, who cited among other comments Trump's repeated disparagement of Smith as ""deranged"".

The judge lifted it days after entering it, giving Trump's lawyers time to prove why his words should not be restricted. But after Trump took advantage of that pause by posting on social media comments that prosecutors said were meant to sway his former chief of staff against giving unfavorable testimony, Chutkan put it back in place.

The US court of appeals for the District of Columbia circuit later lifted it as it considered Trump's appeal.

The judges hearing the case include Cornelia Pillard and Patricia Millett, both appointees of Barack Obama, and Brad Garcia, who joined the bench earlier this year after being nominated by Joe Biden.

A dramatic video captured the moment a Georgia police officer saved a woman from a burning vehicle after she allegedly led him on a chase at speeds in excess of 100 mph in the Atlanta area.

The incident involving Officer Clay Musselman happened along the East-West Connector on Oct. 13, according to the Cobb County Police Department, who hailed his actions as going ""above and beyond the call of duty.""

Footage released by the department shows Musselman trailing a female driver in a high-speed pursuit before being told by a sergeant to not chase her any further.

Musselman could be seen approaching the vehicle after it failed to maneuver a corner in the road and crashed, bursting into flames.

An explosion could be seen as Musselman got out of his police cruiser and began making his way toward the fiery wreck.

""Help! Help!"" a voice could be heard saying before Musselman smashed open the driver-side front window of the vehicle.

""Come out, come out,"" he told the woman.

""I can't, my arm is broken,"" she replied as the flames raged around her.

""You have to, come on,"" Musselman responded.

Police said the driver - who they did not identify - was then taken to a local hospital to be treated for a broken arm and hip fracture.

The Prime Minister said he would do ""what is necessary"" to get the scheme off the ground amid reports of a Cabinet split over plans to override human rights laws.

The Government has promised a new treaty and emergency legislation to ensure the plan is legally watertight following a Supreme Court ruling against it last week.

But the promised new treaty with the African nation appears unlikely to be ratified before the new year and The Times reported that the domestic laws have run into Cabinet opposition.

Immigration minister Robert Jenrick is pushing for the legislation to disapply the Human Rights Act and direct courts to ignore the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) in asylum cases, but he is said to have faced opposition from Home Secretary James Cleverly, Attorney General Victoria Prentis and Justice Secretary Alex Chalk.

Asked about the report following a speech in London, Mr Sunak said: ""I'm completely committed to doing what is necessary to get those flights off and that scheme up and running.

""Because we have prepared for all circumstances we have been working on a new treaty with Rwanda that will address all the concerns that were raised by the Supreme Court, and we will combine that with new emergency legislation that will make it crystal clear - and give Parliament the opportunity to confirm - that Rwanda for all of these purposes is a safe place to implement our scheme.

""And I won't let a foreign court stop us from getting flights off to Rwanda.

""This is a reasonable country. This is a reasonable government.

""But people's patience has run thin and we have got to end this merry-go-round. And that is what I am determined to do.""

It was the UK Supreme Court, rather than ""a foreign court"", which dealt the latest blow to the Government's hopes of sending asylum seekers who arrive in the UK on a one-way trip to Rwanda.

But the Tories are keen to ensure that the ECHR and the Strasbourg court which rules on it will not prevent the policy - which was first announced in 2020 - from being implemented.

Mr Sunak has pinned his hopes on a new legally binding pact with Kigali alongside emergency legislation after the Supreme Court ruled the policy unlawful on November 15.

Downing Street had said in the hours after the defeat that the deal would be laid before Parliament in the ""coming days"" so removal flights can take off ""as soon as possible"".

But Whitehall sources said the treaty is not expected to be published until some time after Chancellor Jeremy Hunt details his set-piece financial announcement on Wednesday.

With the Commons due to rise for its Christmas recess on December 19, there are not enough sitting days to ratify the treaty before the new year under the current schedule, with No 10 saying at least 21 are legally required.

The source did not expect any problems getting Kigali to sign off on the treaty, believing that the emergency legislation is the greater challenge.

Labour's shadow home secretary Yvette Cooper said: ""This is just further chaos from the Conservatives. Further delay to a plan which has already failed.

Unlike all other federal judges, each Supreme Court justice is a judge unto himself or herself. An enforcement mechanism is needed for an ethics code to work.

Still, an uncodified potential enforcement procedure may be available, however flawed it might be sunlight.

Attorneys appearing before the court, including those filing amicus briefs, and other interested citizens can file fact-based motions seeking to use the new code to request a judge to recuse himself or herself for bias or the appearance of bias.

While there is no formal procedure for such motions, and they may be routinely denied, they can when publicized bring this issue to public attention. Hopefully, the embarrassment this might cause over time will force Congress to create a formal code with enforcement.

To the editor: Chemerinsky suggests ways for the Supreme Court to determine standards for the justices' recusals from controversial cases.

Perhaps the real problem lies in the appointment of malleable political jurists who adjust the form of the mantle that they wear due to their life appointment.

The signal disasters of the court -- the Dred Scott case, opening the gates of slavery to all states and territories, thus preordaining the Civil War; and Plessy vs. Ferguson, codifying and enshrining the inequality of the races for many decades -- came from justices who failed to act decently and morally.

Trump asked the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit to overturn or pause District Judge Tanya Chutkan's October limited gag order -- which is currently not in effect -- that would bar him from publicly targeting individual prosecutors, court staff, or potential witnesses tied to the 2020 election-related federal prosecution. The special counsel had urged Chutkan to impose even broader restrictions on the former president's pretrial speech, alleging his public comments threatened the proper administration of the judicial process and might inspire violence from supporters.

Her order did not go as far as prosecutors had requested, but Chutkan said she was treating the former president like any other defendant by preventing him from publicly speaking out against those who might testify against him at trial.

Trump's public targeting of the prosecution -- he has called Smith ""deranged"" and weighed in on reports that former White House chief of staff Mark Meadows cooperated with the probe -- and prosecutors' efforts to curtail him have injected partisan politics into what are at-times mundane pretrial scuffles over a defendant's freedoms.

""This is not about whether I like the language Mr. Trump uses,"" Chutkan said in an October hearing. ""This is about language that presents a danger to the administration of justice."" She said that part of her role is to protect the integrity of the judicial process, and freedom-of-speech protections ""yield"" when those principles are threatened.

The appeals court temporarily put the gag order on hold ahead of Monday's hearing at Trump's request, so it is currently not in effect.

Chutkan's order, Trump's attorneys argued in court filings, was ""muzzling President Trump's core political speech during an historic Presidential campaign"" and was ""viewpoint based.""

The prosecutors and potential witnesses whom Trump was barred from publicly targeting are high-level government officials, they said, and are thus linked to Trump's political campaign. Any restriction on Trump's speech, his defense attorneys argue, limits his right to campaign freely.

""The district court cannot silence President Trump based solely on the anticipated reaction of his audiences. The district court lacks the authority to muzzle the core political speech of the leading candidate for President at the height of his re-election campaign,"" Trump's attorneys argued in court filings. ""President Trump is entitled to proclaim, and the American public is entitled to hear, his core political messages. The Gag Order should be immediately reversed.""

But Smith's team has increasingly worked to tie Trump's public rhetoric to threats of violence, alleging his supporters' reactions to his criticisms could affect the way the trial -- currently set for March 2024 -- proceeds.

Trump, the special counsel alleged, is aware that his language might inspire others to act and ""seeks to use this well-known dynamic to his advantage."" Citing threats to Judge Chutkan herself, prosecutors write that the pattern ""continued unabated as this case and other unrelated cases involving the defendant have progressed.""

Rebutting Trump's claims of First Amendment protection, prosecutors told the appeals court earlier this month, ""The defendant does not need to explicitly incite threats or violence in his public statements, because he well knows that, by publicly targeting perceived adversaries with inflammatory language, he can maintain a patina of plausible deniability while ensuring the desired results.""

Smith's team argued the former president's current campaign to win the office again is not a sufficient reason to grant him extensive pretrial privileges.

In a filing Friday, Trump's team countered, ""The First Amendment does not permit the district court to micromanage President Trump's core political speech"" and said Smith's argument in favor of the order was based on, ""hearsay media reports as a substitute for evidence.""

Trump's motion to stay the gag order received support last week from more than a dozen Republican state attorneys general who echoed his argument that the restrictions on his speech unduly affect voters in primary states.

Spearheaded by Iowa's attorney general, the group - at least six of whom have endorsed Trump - wrote in an amicus brief, ""Our citizens have an interest in hearing from major political candidates in that election. The Order threatens the States' interests by infringing on President Trump's free speech rights.""

Trump has also found an unlikely ally in the American Civil Liberties Union, which brought scores of legal challenges to Trump's policies while he was in office. In the friend-of-the-court brief the ACLU sought to submit to the district court -- the request to file the brief was ultimately denied -- the organization said that Chutkan's order is unconstitutionally vague and impermissibly broad.

The panel considering Trump's request comprises Judges Patricia Millett and Cornelia Pillard -- both Obama appointees -- and Bradley Garcia, a Biden appointee.","{'uri': 'cbsnews.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'CBS News'}",[],https://assets2.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2023/11/10/afee301b-6343-4a04-b5a4-c39c25cf671c/thumbnail/1200x630g2/28430b33ac408f4f307ea6748af676b0/gettyimages-1778597919.jpg?v=5659e73acd91751548aa89950cf015b0,eng-9073936,-0.0980392156862745,25,25,CBS News,cbsnews.com

The authorities in China have imposed tight controls on expression and views any form of public outcry as a risk to social stability

China’s public prosecutors have been warned to be alert to the risk of a popular backlash when handling court cases.

The Chinese government has imposed some of the world’s strictest controls on public expression, but is still hyper sensitive to the risk of any public outcry, which it fears could threaten social stability.

The instruction to prosecutors came in a front-page editorial for The Procuratorial Daily, a mouthpiece for the country’s top prosecuting body, the Supreme People’s Procuratorate.

The article urged prosecutors to “resolutely oppose and resist wrong Western views of constitutionalism, the separation of powers and judicial independence”, echoing comments by President Xi Jinping.

In a further echo of Xi, it also said prosecutors should “dare to fight and fight well”.

They were also urged to standardise the handling of cases, ensure they are handled well and avoid a public backlash by ensuring cases are dealt with properly from the start.

It added that China’s prosecutors should improve their research and monitoring of cases and make sure they manage public opinion.Chinese prosecutors zero in on environmental crime cases, report says

“Ensure early detection, a quick response, correct guidance of the public and the proper handling of cases according to the law,” the editorial said.

In addition, it called for propaganda efforts by prosecutors to increase public recognition of the country’s legal system.

China’s prosecutors’ offices – also known as procuratorates – are an essential part of the judicial system but a number of miscarriages of justice have caused public concern.

It is exceptionally rare for defendants to be acquitted and the conviction rate in Chinese courts stood at 99.95 per cent last year, according to the Law Yearbook of China.

In February 2022, the Supreme People’s Procuratorate said it was taking disciplinary action against those responsible for 246 wrongful convictions that had been identified since 2018. Of these cases, 22 involved defendants who were jailed for more than 10 years.

In 2020 a court in the eastern province of Shandong freed a man named Zhang Zhichao who had spent 13 years in prison after being wrongly convicted of the rape and murder of a schoolgirl in 2006, a case that triggered an extensive media and public outcry.

Last year, 10 prosecutors at different levels in Shandong were subjected to disciplinary action over their handling of the case, but were not removed from their posts.

It was the most recent case where action is known to have been taken against prosecutors

In recent years, several local procuratorates have made public pledges to do a better job of managing public opinion. Government tender records show that some regional procuratorates have paid for services to analyse public opinion.

In March, an article for the official Legal Daily newspaper said cases that generated widespread public interest were the main source of a public outcry over court proceedings.China’s top legislature fills prosecutor, judge and anti-graft positions

However, it said that the police and courts rather than prosecutors were the main targets of public outrage.

The publication also warned that failing to respond to public concerns about court cases had also had an impact and reduced awareness of the work prosecutors do.","{'uri': 'scmp.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'South China Morning Post'}",[],https://cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/d8/images/canvas/2023/11/20/875d9659-b8ba-4a0e-b5ed-5745be468706_624ae301.jpg?itok=cYQRZlXu,,-0.1764705882352942,25,25,South China Morning Post,scmp.com

The prime minister is said to be under pressure to use emergency legislation to disapply the Human Rights Act and tell courts to ignore the European Convention on Human Rights in asylum cases.

A senior government source told The Times the strategy was ""mad"", saying the courts would go ""ballistic"" and questioning whether Mr Sunak would be willing to endorse it.

Another warned that the plan could lead to more legal challenges which would delay the Rwanda scheme further, saying: ""There's a real danger in sounding tough but failing to deliver.""

It comes after Mr Sunak promised emergency legislation to deem Rwanda a ""safe"" country and a new treaty with Kigali in a bid to address issues that led the UK's highest court to rule the deportation scheme was unlawful.

But Suella Braverman, who was sacked as home secretary last week, claimed the PM's ""Plan B"" is ""simply a tweaked version of the failed Plan A"".

He is considering a plan to defy the UK's Human Rights Act as part of a desperate push to get deportation flights off the ground.

But, as Mr Sunak considers blocking human rights laws as part of the push, a Conservative Party source told the Guardian: ""This would tear the party apart. Several cabinet ministers and the [moderate] One Nationers would not stand for it - the prime minister wouldn't even get it through the Commons. Never mind that this wouldn't placate the head-bangers on the right either.""

Mr Sunak's updated Rwanda treaty is expected to be presented to MPs this week after chancellor Jeremy Hunt's autumn statement.

The treaty is expected to attempt to address the Supreme Court's concerns around ""refoulement"" - the potential for refugees rejected by Rwanda to be sent back to the country they are fleeing.

Asked on Sunday whether the government would go further and leave the ECHR, Mr Hunt said: ""We don't believe at this stage that that is necessary ... We don't believe it will come to that, at this stage - we don't want to do that.""

However, the chancellor added that the government was determined to stop ""foreign judges"" from deciding who comes to the UK.

A Hong Kong customs officer suspected of raping a Swedish tourist in a hotel has been remanded in custody.

Li Kin-on, 28, was not required to enter a plea on a charge of rape during his first appearance at Eastern Court on Monday, as prosecutors asked for an eight-week period for further investigation.

A charge sheet submitted to the court said the defendant, who lived in a public housing estate in Chai Wan, attacked the woman at Ming Court Hotel in Wan Chai on Friday.

Investigators requested more time to gather evidence by collecting relevant CCTV footage, contacting potential witnesses, conducting a forensic examination and inspecting the defendant’s mobile devices, the court heard.

Digging out forgotten laws from dusty shelves and freshening them up with some trendy security elements has become the latest fashion for Communist Party rulers in China.

It happened as President Xi Jinping called on officials to prepare for “worst-case and most extreme scenarios,” in other words, an unprecedented security threat posed by the United States and other Western powers.

Whether the threats are imaginary or more real than ever, scrambling to expand legal tool kits appears sensible to a Chinese leadership eager to rationalise its moves and defend itself from spies or other forms of external infiltration.

The latest law to be refashioned was China’s State Secrets Law. A dozen new clauses have been added in a draft revision unveiled in late October, the biggest amendment to the statute in over a decade after it was first introduced in 1988.

Education, technology and military facilities, among other areas, were all covered as the draft expanded the reach and depth of the law.

But what constitutes a “state secret” is never clearly defined – making one wonder if anything could be counted when necessary – as Beijing sees itself locked in an intelligence war with Washington.

One clause stipulates that all state employees with access to state secrets are banned from leaving China without prior approval, with the rule applying for some time even after changing jobs or retiring.

Money must be set aside to guard government information from the county level and above, another burdensome administrative cost for local governments that are already facing insolvency after investing all they had into fighting the coronavirus.Chinese lawmakers review proposed changes to state secrets law

The drafted law provides the National Administration of State Secret Protection – a once low-profile office under the State Council, China’s cabinet – with authority to check and question all when it comes to guarding whatever is deemed secret enough to warrant it.

Information security, meanwhile, has also been made a national priority, and funds are being allocated to develop cutting-edge technologies specifically for the purpose of data safety.

Echoing this move, a dozen leading universities have set up national security studies as a new discipline to train young scholars, following the Education Ministry’s call in 2021 to cultivate talent in that arena.

As Beijing faces what it calls “unprecedented uncertainties”, it seems determined to augment its toolbox on state security.

The revised law on state secrets is likely to sail unopposed through the country’s legislative process, as have other laws that have had new coats of national security-tinted paint.China charities to be overseen by police, spy agencies under proposed law change

A law governing charities was also chosen for revision in October, with new clauses on having police and state security forces oversee charities in addition to other potential watchdogs, including the taxation and cyberspace administrations.

But the most high-profile amendment in recent months is the one levied on the anti-espionage law, which came into effect in July after its third revision since its introduction in 2014.

The sweeping law expanded the definition of a threat and lists cyberattacks by a “spying entity or its surrogate” as an act of espionage for the first time, sending foreign investors’ confidence to new lows amid a sagging post-pandemic economic recovery. Premier Li Qiang’s 31- point plan to boost business sentiment has not eased worries to the degree China had hoped.

As lawmakers ponder which piece of legislation is due for the next makeover, chilling effects are being felt in the business world. Raids were carried out earlier this year against leading US consulting firms Bain & Company, Capvision and the Mintz Group, whose Asia operations were formerly run by CIA veteran Randal Phillips.

A sense of paranoia and uncertainty is scaring away foreign capital – which China has relied on over the past four decades as one of its critical engines for economic growth.

Foreign businesses are considering downsizing their China offices or closing them for good, fearing an increasingly unpredictable environment will make it challenging to carry out their affairs.

The expansion of Beijing’s legal tool kit can be traced back to 2021, as the new Data Security Law stipulated that companies transferring the state’s “core data” overseas without approval would have to pay a penalty of up to 10 million yuan (US$1.37 million) and could be forced to shut down.

The law laid the foundation for officials to tighten data management and propose more industry-specific regulations, such as the Finance Ministry and cyberspace watchdog saying in mid-November that auditing firms should undergo scrutiny.Spy games: why the US-China cold war is heating up in public

China’s top spy agency has also emerged from the shadows and announced several espionage cases, including the capture of two CIA agents in August.

The agency’s chief justified the moves as China having to proactively defend against spies as risks arise in a more unpredictable global environment.

The State Security Ministry brushed aside concerns, saying that the law protected suspects’ rights and set out the process for investigating state security cases.

In a seemingly “grim and complex” state, deemed such by Communist Party leaders, the changes seem to be another example of prioritising politics over economy. The consequences, as always, will remain to be seen.60-Second Catch-up

In another sign of the dismal state of US-China relations, public espionage disclosures have increased markedly in recent months on both sides of the Pacific as spy agencies that once lurked in the dark openly tout their handiwork.

Behind the strategic leaks and veneer of transparency is a shadow play mirroring the broader geopolitics, as intelligence communities face pressure to look effective at home and tough abroad, with little sign that the spy-versus-spy showdown will end any time soon, security analysts and former spies said.

Buck Aldridge fatally shot Leonard Cure during a roadside struggle after pulling him over for speeding, it wasn´t the first time a traffic stop involving the Camden County sheriff's deputy had spiraled into violence.

Last year, Aldridge dragged a driver from a car that crashed after fleeing the deputy on Interstate 95. Body and dash camera video obtained by The Associated Press show the driver on his back as Aldridge punches him. Records indicate the deputy faced no disciplinary action.

Personnel records show Aldridge was fired in August 2017 by a police department in the same Georgia county after he threw a woman to the ground and handcuffed her during a traffic stop. The Camden County Sheriff's Office hired him nine months later.

Aldridge stopped Cure for speeding Oct. 16 and ended up shocking the 53-year-old Black man with a Taser after he refused to put his hands behind him to be cuffed. Body and dash camera videos show Cure fought back and had a hand at the deputy's throat when Aldridge shot him point-blank.

Relatives have said Cure likely resisted because of psychological trauma from spending 16 years imprisoned in Florida for an armed robbery he didn´t commit. Officials exonerated and freed him in 2020.

The Georgia Bureau of Investigation is investigating Cure's death and will submit its findings to prosecutors. Aldridge's attorney said the video shows he fired in self-defense. Regardless, critics question whether he should have been wearing a badge given his history of aggression.

Aldridge was placed on administrative pending an investigation after he fatally shot Leonard Cure on Oct. 16, 2023, in Camden County, Georgia. The deputy shot the Black man at point-blank range during a traffic stop after the man, who had been wrongfully imprisoned years ago, grabbed the officer by the neck and was forcing his head backward, according to video released by a sheriff. (Camden County Sheriff's Office via AP)

""This guy should have never been on the force,"" said Timothy Bessent Sr., president of Camden County´s NAACP chapter.

The AP obtained Aldridge's personnel records as well as reports and videos from the June 2022 chase and arrest using Georgia's open records law.

A former U.S. Marine, Aldridge, 41, worked nearly five years for the Kingsland Police Department in Georgia's southeast corner. His file shows Aldridge was disciplined for using unnecessary force in February 2014 and May 2017. The second time he was suspended for three days without pay.

The department fired Aldridge for his third infraction just three months later. Police records say Aldridge was assisting with a traffic stop when he tried to handcuff a woman - not to arrest her, but to keep her outside her car. One deputy told investigators Aldridge cuffed the woman after ""picking her up and throwing her on the ground."" She was cited for letting an unlicensed person drive her car.

Aldridge was hired by the sheriff's office in May 2018. He disclosed his firing on his job application.

Aldridge's termination wouldn't automatically disqualify him from working for another agency, though some would consider it a huge liability, said retired police Maj. Neill Franklin.

""If someone´s terminated from another police department for use of excessive force, they´re not getting hired by the Maryland State Police or the Baltimore Police Department,"" said Franklin, who led training programs for both agencies. ""It's just not worth the risk.""

Bessent and other advocates say it´s an example of Camden County Sheriff Jim Proctor tolerating unnecessary violence.

Proctor, who has been sheriff for a decade, declined to comment. Spokesman Capt. Larry Bruce cited the investigation into Cure's death and pending civil litigation involving other deputies.

Since last year, six Camden County deputies have been indicted on felony charges and fired for violence against jail detainees and a motorist.

In September 2022, jail security cameras recorded guards rushing into the cell of Jarrett Hobbs, who was punched in the head and neck and hurled against a wall. Hobbs was charged with assaulting jailers until his attorney obtained the video. His charges were dropped, and three deputies were indicted.

Two more jailers were charged and fired for incidents in March and July. Security video showed one push a detainee to the floor and punch him before another guard intervened. The other deputy shoved a handcuffed detainee headfirst into a door, knocking him unconscious.

""You´ve got these deputies running wild and doing what they want to do,"" said Harry Daniels, a civil rights attorney who won a legal settlement for Hobbs. ""The consequences have come from the GBI and the district attorney´s office. It should not come from an outside agency.""

He points to Christine Newman, named ""Deputy of the Month"" two months after a dash camera recorded her slapping a handcuffed driver across the face and slamming the woman's head into a patrol SUV. The driver had refused to exit her vehicle after being pulled over for a rolling stop Jan. 16, 2022.

Newman was fired a year later after being indicted on charges including aggravated assault and violating her oath of office. She has pleaded not guilty. Newman's attorney, Robert Persse, called her a ""loyal deputy"" whom he looks forward to defending in court.

The number of deputies facing charges ""indicates a culture that may not encourage use of force, but certainly tolerates inappropriate use of force,"" said retired LaGrange, Georgia, Police Chief Louis Dekmar.

""If folks are held accountable and there are clear lines, you generally don´t see that in law enforcement agencies,"" said Dekmar, a former president of the International Association of Chiefs of Police.

A spike in claims involving the sheriff's office caused Camden County's government to get dropped by its insurance company in July, said Mike Spiers, the county's risk management director. The county got new policies, he said, but its deductible for liability jumped from $25,000 per claim to $250,000.

Aldridge was placed on administrative leave while the GBI investigates Cure's death.

""Buck Aldridge is a fine officer and the video speaks for itself,"" said Adrienne Browning, Aldridge's attorney. ""It´s clear his life was in danger and he defended himself.""

Video released of the fatal confrontation along I-95 shows Aldridge telling Cure he's being charged with reckless driving for speeding in excess of 100 mph (161 kph). Cure argues, but obeys commands to get out and put his hands on his truck. However, he ignores commands to put his hands behind him.

That's when Aldridge fires his Taser into Cure's back. Cure fights back, and video shows them grappling beside the highway. Cure maintains a grip on Aldridge's face and neck after being struck with a baton.

""Yeah, bitch!"" Cure says. Then he slumps to the ground after Aldridge fires a single shot.

Dekmar, Franklin and a third expert told AP they believe the shooting was legal, as Aldridge appeared to be in danger when he fired. But they also criticized how Aldridge began the encounter by shouting at Cure and said made no effort to deescalate.

""He escalated the situation with Mr. Cure,"" said former Memphis police officer Thaddeus Johnson, a criminal justice professor at Georgia State University and a senior fellow for the Council on Criminal Justice. ""He has no control over his emotions.""

Johnson said Aldridge showed a similar lack of control during a June 2022 arrest after chasing two speeding cars.

After one car crashes, body and dash camera video shows Aldridge shouting expletives as he approaches with his gun drawn. The driver is on his back when Aldridge starts dragging him headfirst from the car, then punches him.

The driver resists being cuffed but complies after another deputy's dog bites him and Aldridge shocks him with a Taser. The driver was charged with drug trafficking, reckless driving and fleeing an officer.

Aldridge was promoted to staff sergeant two months later. His sheriff's personnel file shows no disciplinary actions.

Johnson said he sees no justification for Aldridge punching the arrested driver. Even if prosecutors don't charge him in Cure's death, he said, ""from what I saw in the video, he deserves to be fired.""

""We have to hold officers to a higher standard,"" Johnson said, ""even though they are human.""

The high court is to consider for the first time whether universities owe a legal duty of care to their students, which campaigners argue would save lives and bring England and Wales in line with other countries.

The landmark hearing next month comes at a time of widespread concern about declining student mental health and a number of widely reported suicides, including that of Natasha Abrahart, 20, who was a second year physics student at Bristol University when she killed herself in 2018.

Bereaved families, including Natasha's parents, Robert and Margaret Abrahart, argue a statutory duty of care would oblige university staff to exercise reasonable care and avoid acts that could foreseeably cause students harm.

In May last year, the Abraharts successfully sued Bristol University under the Equality Act for not taking reasonable care of their daughter's wellbeing, health and safety. Natasha, who had chronic social anxiety, took her own life a day before she was due to give an oral exam in front of teachers and fellow students.

The Abraharts were awarded £50,000 in damages by the county court and have been granted permission by the high court to appeal against a separate finding that the university did not owe their daughter a legal duty of care under the law of negligence. The three-day hearing, which is due to start on 11 December in Bristol, will also consider an appeal by Bristol University against the earlier finding that it breached the Equality Act.

In a separate move, the Equality and Human Rights Commission has been granted permission to intervene in what it described as a ""landmark legal case"" that could have far-reaching implications.

A University of Bristol spokesperson said the circumstances of Natasha's death were not disputed. ""In appealing, we are seeking absolute clarity for the higher education sector around the application of the Equality Act when staff do not know a student has a disability, or when it has yet to be diagnosed.

""We hope it will also enable us to provide transparency to students and their families about how we support them and to give all university staff across the country the confidence to do that properly.""

The legal duty of care issue was debated in Westminster this year after parents and supporters gathered more than 128,000 signatures in a parliamentary petition calling for its introduction. At the end, however, the government said it had no plans for new legislation.

Robert Abrahart, a retired university lecturer from Nottingham, said: ""Like many other parents we were appalled to learn that universities don't already owe a legal duty to exercise reasonable care and skill in the way they treat their students. We are delighted that the high court has agreed to consider whether such a duty should now be imposed. If this happens it will not only save lives but it will bring universities in England and Wales into line with their counterparts in Australia and the USA.""

Margaret Abrahart, a retired psychological wellbeing practitioner, added: ""We need something positive to come from the nightmare of Natasha's death. We have petitioned parliament, we've spoken with political parties, and now we're trying to do what we can through the courts. We don't expect universities to treat students like children and don't think lecturers should have parental responsibility. We just want to see a common sense legal duty on universities to take reasonable steps not to harm their students.""

Gus Silverman, of the law firm Deighton Pierce Glynn, who is representing the Abraharts, said: ""The University of Bristol told the county court that it didn't owe any relevant duty to care for its students under the law of negligence. Now the high court will consider, for the first time, whether that is correct.""

Bristol University said its staff helped Natasha with a referral to both the NHS and the university's disability services, and suggested alternative options for her academic assessment to alleviate her anxiety. ""However the judgment suggests they should have gone further than this, although Natasha's mental health difficulties had not been diagnosed. Understandably, this has caused considerable anxiety as it puts a major additional burden on staff who are primarily educators, not healthcare professionals,"" the spokesperson said.

""Collectively, we are deeply concerned by the increase of mental health issues amongst our young people nationally and are determined to do our very best to support any student who is struggling with their mental health through the provision of a wide range of services. At the same time, it is important that students and their families are clear on what universities can and cannot do, and that students receive appropriate specialist care under the NHS should they need it.""

Universities UK, which speaks on behalf of more than 140 institutions, said in an earlier briefing that universities already had a general duty of care to their students not to cause harm by careless acts or omissions. ""We do not believe a further statutory duty would be the best approach to improve outcomes for students.""","{'uri': 'theguardian.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","[{'uri': 'sally_weale@theguardian.com', 'name': 'Sally Weale', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': False}]",https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/209cad72e91f2041e7ef1ea1cbff3ee8215dd22d/104_98_541_325/master/541.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&s=d70d1c16ea4061eaf55755f6ad243fbb,,0.09019607843137245,25,25,The Guardian,theguardian.com

Shakeira Yvonne Rucker, 37, was found dead inside a storage unit at the Self Storage on Wiggins Road in Apopka, Florida, the Orange County Sheriff's Office said in a Saturday Facebook post. The Sheriff's Office is now investigating Rucker's case as a homicide.

""This is not the update we wanted to be giving you all today,"" Orange County Sheriff John Mina announced at a press conference Sunday, adding that the story has had a lot of ""twists and turns"" over the last week and has covered many jurisdictions.

Police had just finished searching for Rucker in an area near Bob White Airfield in Mt. Dora, Florida, on Saturday when they got a 911 call from someone at the Self Storage reporting ""a smell emanating from one of the units,"" Mina said.

Orange County sheriff's deputies responded to the call and found Rucker dead in the unit from apparent gunshot wounds, Mina said. He noted that that a full autopsy is underway.

Officials said the storage unit belonged to her estranged husband, Cory Hill, the prime suspect in Rucker's murder, and that he has not been cooperative in the investigation.

The killing took place at the storage unit, Mina said. No motive was announced.

""He is the suspect. We are not looking for anyone else. He will be charged with the murder eventually in this case,"" Mina said.

The public defender's office representing Hill did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the case.

Mina said Hill is already in the Orange County Jail, charged with four counts of attempted homicide for shooting at his ""girlfriend and family"" on Nov. 12. According to Orange County jail records, he was booked on Nov. 13.

NBC affiliate WESH reported that Hill was shooting at a former girlfriend and her family in that case. The Orange County Sheriff's Office did not immediately respond to a request for clarification Sunday night.

Rucker, whom WESH reported was a mother of four, was first reported missing after her family said they last saw her on Nov. 11, according to a Facebook post from the Winter Springs Police Department. Police said she was last seen leaving her Winter Springs home that day, and her family believed she had been with Hill.

""It's not the outcome we expected, but there's a little bit of closure for Shakeira's family,"" WSPD Chief of Police Matthew Tracht said Sunday.

Tracht said the team worked 16-to-18-hour days to find Rucker and worked across four counties, including Orange, Seminole, Polk and Lake counties. They also got help from the Mt. Dora Police Department, the Floria Department of Law Enforcement and the FBI, he said.","{'uri': 'nbcnews.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'NBC News'}",[],"https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_nbcnews-fp-1024-512,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2023-11/231119-FLORIDA-WOMAN-DEAD-STORAGE-UNIT-RC-1138P-ce1dee.png",eng-9075051,-0.3176470588235294,25,25,NBC News,nbcnews.com

Ryan Moreno, 47, was arrested for murder in connection with a crash that turned into a homicide investigation in Fairfield in October, police said.

On October 13, police responded to a report of a single-vehicle crash near Cement Hill, west of Peabody Road. Police believed the truck left the road and crashed into several buildings.

The 44-year-old driver from Oakland was found ejected from the vehicle.

Less than a week later, police said the case was being investigated as a homicide following an autopsy.

Police said one bullet was found in the man's body. They said they believed the crash was a result of a shooting.

The motive remains under investigation.

Moreno was arrested with the help of the FBI, Solano County Violent Crime Task Force and the Vacaville Police Department.","{'uri': 'cbsnews.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'CBS News'}",[],https://assets1.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2023/11/20/04dfb28a-0a10-4550-b6dd-3c01fa4fba14/thumbnail/1200x630/e0d38009c754c4d37ea04a3a6b4f7a4d/gettyimages-903236020.jpg?v=5659e73acd91751548aa89950cf015b0,,-0.3333333333333334,25,25,CBS News,cbsnews.com

Hong Kong prides itself on being a diverse international city with laws designed to ensure equal treatment. The Equal Opportunities Commission (EOC) is responsible for overseeing legislation in specific areas.

The city has laws against discrimination on the grounds of sex, disability, family status and race. But the commission’s work has, for years, gone beyond those areas, covering research into other types of discrimination, such as on the grounds of sexual orientation or age.

The study of these pressing issues and the possibility of new legislation would appear to be a natural part of the commission’s activities. It is perfectly placed to investigate such matters.

But the EOC had been advised by the Department of Justice that work of this kind goes beyond the legal remit of the organisation. It cannot stray further than the legislation already in place.

Work on legal amendments to protect the LGBTQ community, ongoing for more than 18 months, has been stopped as a result of the advice, which the commission’s own lawyers agree with.Hong Kong equality body told to back off from law changes to protect LGBTQ people

Commission chairman Ricky Chu Man-kin, speaking at a panel discussion on diversity and inclusion to mark the 120th anniversary of the South China Morning Post, said the body was now looking at existing laws instead, to see if they could be applied.

The commission has, in the past, researched discrimination on the grounds of sexual orientation, publishing a report in 2016 calling for legislation. It has also made submissions to UN institutions on the issue. No laws have been passed.

Another study commissioned by the EOC in 2016, highlighted significant levels of age discrimination and showed strong public support for new laws to combat it.

The fight against discrimination is not frozen in time or limited to four areas. The EOC should be permitted to explore the development and expansion of Hong Kong’s legal armoury against unequal treatment. This may require an amendment to the law to broaden its mandate to that extent.

A landmark ruling by the top court in September required the government to develop a framework for recognising “core rights” of same-sex couples.

Other court decisions have outlawed discrimination against members of the LGBTQ community in specific areas. It would make sense for a law on discrimination on the grounds of sexual orientation to form part of steps to be taken in this area.

A recent study showed 71 per cent of the community to be in favour of such a law.

The commission should be at the heart of promoting and preventing discrimination of all kinds. It is well-positioned to conduct research and make proposals that enhance Hong Kong’s international reputation by furthering diversity and inclusion.","{'uri': 'scmp.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'South China Morning Post'}",[],https://cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/og_image_scmp_editorial/public/d8/images/canvas/2023/11/19/5a9eab08-2172-4caa-ba7c-4eb7e7fef7dc_1da8e3bf.jpg?itok=mF_oS77Q&v=1700405430,,0.4352941176470588,25,25,South China Morning Post,scmp.com

Rishi Sunak is considering blocking a key human rights law to help force through plans to send asylum seekers to Rwanda amid growing pressure from rightwing Conservative MPs.

No 10 has discussed the possibility of ""disapplying"" the Human Rights Act to an emergency bill in an effort to minimise legal challenges against the prime minister's key immigration policy. Ministers are aware such a proposal could face rebellions in the Commons and the Lords, which could vote down the proposals.

A Conservative party source said: ""This would tear the party apart. Several cabinet ministers and the one nationers would not stand for it - the prime minister wouldn't even get it through the Commons. Never mind that this wouldn't placate the head bangers on the right either.""

The government's quandary has emerged as a former supreme court judge said the proposals to send people seeking asylum to the east African country with no possibility of a return to the UK were ""probably dead"".

The prime minister is under intense pressure from the Conservative right to get the scheme working as part of his pledge to ""stop the boats"" amid the Channel asylum seeker crisis. Right-leaning MPs are demanding that a flight takes off for Kigali before the next general election, which is expected to take place before the end of 2024.

It follows a ruling by the UK's highest court on Wednesday that Sunak's flagship policy is unlawful because of the possibility of ""refoulement"" - that refugees are at risk of being sent back to their country of origin by the Rwandan government.

Refoulement is prohibited by international laws, including the European convention on human rights (ECHR), the UN refugee convention and the UN convention against torture, which have been given effect in domestic law by the Human Rights Act.

Discussions about blocking the Human Rights Act had taken place in Downing Street since the ruling, sources said.

Hours after the court ruling, Sunak said he would upgrade the agreement with the Rwandan government to a treaty and launch an emergency bill within weeks to prevent court challenges. Ministers are looking at requiring MPs to sit on Fridays and reordering the parliamentary timetable to accelerate a new bill.

Party sources said they were aware that dozens of Tory MPs could vote with Labour to block any such change. Any block on human rights laws could also face objections in the House of Lords because of mounting concern it would breach the UK's international law obligations under the ECHR.

The hard-right New Conservatives grouping demanded that Sunak's new legislation ""must disapply the Human Rights Act"", while the former home secretary Suella Braverman, who was sacked by Sunak last week, said the new bill must exclude all avenues of legal challenge.

When approached by the Guardian, No 10 declined to comment.

The former supreme court judge Lord Sumption said of the Rwanda plan: ""I think the current Rwanda scheme is probably dead, but we obviously have to suspend judgment until we see what this legislation or this new treaty looks like."" He also suggested judges in Strasbourg would come to a similar view of the scheme's legality as UK supreme court justices.

He told Sky News: ""The government have made clear ... that they don't intend to do that [withdraw from the ECHR]. Although the government may well ignore interim orders from Strasbourg, they presumably intend to comply with final orders from Strasbourg. It [the Strasbourg court] will investigate safety for itself and probably arrive at a conclusion very similar to that of the supreme court.""

He said he was ""sceptical"" of reported plans to send British civil servants to work in the east African country, adding: ""The main problem [with the] scheme is that it outsources to Rwanda the decision about whether people have refugee status.""

Speaking on Sunday, Jeremy Hunt, the chancellor, defended the government's plans for emergency legislation and added that the government did not want to leave the ECHR despite calls from the right of the Conservative party.

""I think we will see that, because I do think, when you interview me next year, we will be having a discussion about how we have succeeded in this plan, and I will be saying: look, it wasn't easy, we kept at it, but that is what we promise to do,"" he told the BBC's Laura Kuenssberg.

Ministers are under pressure to process the asylum claims of tens of thousands of people who arrived in the UK after the illegal migration act was passed in July.

Immigration experts said ministers could be in breach of the UN refugee convention because asylum seekers were being held - in some cases in detention centres - indefinitely. They have no prospect of being removed to a third safe country or being granted access to the asylum system in the UK under the act.

Enver Solomon, the chief executive of the Refugee Council, said: ""The Illegal Migration Act is unfair, unworkable, and expensive. It's causing huge distress and anxiety for those we support with rising levels of acute mental health problems for already traumatised men, women and children. There are serious questions about the legality of leaving people in this situation indefinitely and the government should swiftly take action by allowing them all to be given a fair hearing in the asylum system and treated with compassion and dignity.""","{'uri': 'theguardian.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","[{'uri': 'rajeev_syal@theguardian.com', 'name': 'Rajeev Syal', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': False}]",https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c555c48e9f8b37febf5ffe88f9b9a6f356b9dde0/0_100_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&s=da41a57f11aec94b16b8b76b92291cd3,eng-9074973,-0.1294117647058823,25,25,The Guardian,theguardian.com

Nov 19 (Reuters) - A Missouri jury ordered Bayer to pay $1.56 billion to four plaintiffs who claimed the company's Roundup weedkiller caused injuries including cancer, a verdict that could intensify investor pressure on the German drugs and agricultural chemicals company to change its legal strategy.

The Cole County, Missouri jury found on Friday that Bayer's Monsanto business was liable for claims of negligence, design defects and failing to warn plaintiffs of the potential dangers of using Roundup, according to court documents.

Valorie Gunther of New York, Jimmy Draeger of Missouri and Daniel Anderson of California were awarded a combined $61.1 million in compensatory damages and $500 million each in punitive damages. Each was diagnosed with non-Hodgkin lymphoma that they alleged was caused by using Roundup on their family property. Draeger's wife Brenda was awarded $100,000 for the harm she allegedly suffered from her husband's disease.

The punitive damages could be reduced on appeal as it exceeds U.S. Supreme Court guidance.

Bayer has said that decades of studies have shown Roundup and its active ingredient, glyphosate, are safe for human use.

The verdict is the fourth straight loss in court for Bayer, after the company had been found not liable to plaintiffs in nine consecutive trials. Earlier this month, Union Investment, one of Bayer's top 10 shareholders, called on the company to consider trying to engage with plaintiffs to settle more cases.

Bart Rankin, partner at Forrest Weldon which represented the plaintiffs, said in a statement the victory was the first of many on behalf of thousands of plaintiffs.

Bayer said in a statement that it has strong arguments to get the recent verdicts overturned on appeal.

It said in the recent trials that have gone against the company, courts have improperly permitted plaintiffs to misrepresent the European Union's renewal process for glyphosate and the safety assessment by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.

The EU Commission said last week it would renew its approval of glyphosate based on safety assessments of the European Food Agency and European Chemicals Agency after EU member states failed to give a clear opinion on the renewal.

Around 165,000 claims have been made against the company for personal injuries allegedly caused by Roundup, which Bayer acquired as part of its $63 billion purchase of agrochemical company Monsanto in 2018.

In 2020, Bayer settled most of the then-pending Roundup cases for up to $10.9 billion. Around 50,000 claims remain pending, according to regulatory filings.

The argument between the two cooks started over potato croquettes and resulted in one man strangling and punching his kitchen colleague.

Rashim Salim, 35, and his victim, known only as Mr Bardu, threw potatoes at each other just before he lunged for the man.

Salim was handed an 18-month community sentence at Reading crown court for the assault causing actual bodily harm, which he admitted.

The judge heard he had grabbed his colleague by the throat and punched him three times in the incident on January 27 at the 38-bedroom Cantley House Hotel in upmarket Wokingham, Berkshire.

Judge Joanna Matson heard how Salim, of Challener Road, High Wycombe, was involved in a heated argument with Mr Barbu.

The confrontation spiralled with a row over potatoes and croquettes taking place.

Prosecutor Shaan Sethi described the incident to the court, saying that Salim had 'grabbed the complainant by the neck and squeezed' before punching him in the torso three times.

However, Judge Matson stated that after checking the CCTV footage from the incident that the strangulation was not prolonged.

Defence counsel for Salim, Adele Pullarp told the court that Salim was holding down two jobs that helped to pay child maintenance costs for his older children.

The judge heard that he had been diagnosed with stage five kidney failure in 2020 and had to undergo dialysis.

She added that he was a successful chef who had maintained a romantic relationship over the last five years.

The judge heard that Salim had previous convictions for violence from 2015 but these were not taken as an aggravating factor by the court.

Salim was ordered to complete 15 rehabilitation activity requirement days, 140 hours of unpaid work and to pay £120 in compensation to Mr Barbu.","{'uri': 'metro.co.uk', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'Metro'}","[{'uri': 'alan_shields@metro.co.uk', 'name': 'Alan Shields', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': False}]",https://metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/SEC_180860634-13dc.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1,,-0.3098039215686275,25,25,Metro,metro.co.uk

The Coalition had been hammering the Albanese government for not being better prepared in the event of losing the case and that they should have had legislation ready to go.

The opposition leader, Peter Dutton, suggested the critical date was June - because that was when a preliminary hearing suggested the case was on ""shaky ground"".

At that hearing justice Jacqueline Gleeson said the chances of the government being able to deport the plaintiff, NZYQ - which is supposed to be the purpose of immigration detention - seemed ""hopeless"".

It troubled her that ""no one may be turning their mind to the inevitable deterioration of a person who is in a situation of hopelessness"".

But there were warning bells long before about how shaky the 2004 decision of Al-Kateb - which determined indefinite immigration detention was lawful - really was.

The shadow immigration minister, Dan Tehan, last week gave another critical date: Labor ""had a briefing in 2021, when they were in opposition, which showed that this decision was possible"".

Labor's Matt Keogh correctly identified that this was an admission by the Coalition that it had ""received advice in 2021 in relation to these issues"".

It's worth remembering the solicitor general, the second law officer, gets to read over what his or her predecessors thought about the big legal issues.

The upshot is Labor and the Coalition were likely told the same thing about the legal foundation of indefinite detention.

Was the high court's decision to strike down Al-Kateb a day that both major parties knew would come?

The original decision of Al-Kateb was decided by the narrowest of margins, four justices to three. The legal community was always sceptical that they'd got it right.

Proper full high court reconsideration of it proved elusive. Cases that came closest were distinguishable on their facts, decided another way, or the plaintiffs released. But still, there was a rumble of discontent with the decision.

In the case of another plaintiff, known as M47, justice Virginia Bell said two of the majority judges didn't pay enough attention to the ""principle of legality"", that depriving a person of liberty required clearer words. She would have overturned Al-Kateb.

The case law on separation of powers, which ended up being the winning argument, got stronger and stronger.

Eventually, it became clear that it would take somebody in exactly the same situation as Al-Kateb to come before the court: someone who it was not practical to deport, and for who there was no real prospect of that changing in the foreseeable future.

In December 2022 the federal court made such a finding about an Egyptian man named Tony Sami.

As he prepared to take his case to the high court, he was deported ""unwillingly"" - a man who had spent a decade in immigration detention, who justice Debra Mortimer said authorities had taken a ""leisurely"" approach to removing, was whisked away just in time to avoid a challenge that could free hundreds of people.

The commonwealth met its match in NZYQ, a stateless Rohingyan man who had raped a 10-year-old boy, an offence so grave as to make his release or removal to a third country impossible.

So when NZYQ sued the immigration minister, Andrew Giles, this time the government agreed in a special case on 30 May that there was no real likelihood of deporting him.

Still, it kicked into gear at the direction of the home affairs minister, Clare O'Neil, who asked that no stone be left unturned, resulting in a mad dash to ask six countries to take NZYQ.

All said no, except the US, which promised to take a hard look. Obviously, that wasn't enough to convince the court, so NZYQ was freed, with 92 others following because they too could not be deported.

O'Neil told Sky News on Sunday the department thought it was ""likely"" to win the case. It should not have been at all confident.

There was a better indication, too, that the government did not think it was on firm ground: Giles has noted several times the federal and state police joint operation to respond in the event of a loss had been set up in advance of the hearing. That's an unusual redundancy for a side expecting to win.

For much of the past week, Dutton and Tehan have essentially argued where there is a will to detain these people, there must be a way. The court said otherwise.

Perhaps it's precisely because the Australian public was so supportive of locking people up and throwing away the key that the search for better and more constitutionally sound alternatives ceased.

This is a decision we will pay for now.

The solicitor general, Stephen Donaghue, said as much on the second day of hearings, warning the commonwealth would be exposed to ""inevitable"" damages claims for false imprisonment.

These claims would be ""undefendable"" in cases where the government conceded the people had been detained while it was impossible to deport them, he said.

Both sides suspected indefinite detention could fall and they now expect demands for compensation.

The price of the detention regime has been decades of lost liberty, ""hopelessness"", and likely a hefty bill for taxpayers.","{'uri': 'theguardian.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","[{'uri': 'paul_karp@theguardian.com', 'name': 'Paul Karp', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': False}]",https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/22fbe2d8b2f4b673c0674c5f653f4fa230a845ee/0_188_8256_4954/master/8256.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n&s=19636c8a7b7db765755386f0de6621a8,eng-9074360,-0.2156862745098039,25,25,The Guardian,theguardian.com

Rwanda plan 'probably dead' in its current form - ex-Supreme Court judge

The Government's Rwanda plan is 'probably dead' in its current form, former Supreme Court judge Lord Sumption claimed today.

When asked on the Sky News whether the scheme is 'dead', he replied: 'I think the current Rwanda scheme is probably dead, but we obviously have to suspend judgment until we see what this legislation or this new treaty looks like.'

Lord Sumption also suggested judges in Strasbourg would come to a similar view of the scheme's legality as UK Supreme Court justices.

He said: 'The Government have made clear... that they don't intend to do that (withdraw from the European Convention on Human Rights).

'Although the Government may well ignore interim orders from Strasbourg, they presumably intend to comply with final orders from Strasbourg.

'It (the Strasbourg court) will investigate safety for itself and probably arrive at a conclusion very similar to that of the Supreme Court.'

He also said he is 'sceptical' of reported plans to send British civil servants to work in the east African country, adding: 'The main problem (with the) scheme is that it outsources to Rwanda the decision about whether people have refugee status.'

A Tory source told the Sun on Sunday: 'Suella was always clear about what was needed to stop the boats from the minute she came in as home ­secretary.

'That never changed. It was very tense at times - she got more of what she wanted in negotiations, but never enough.

'Rishi and No 10 repeatedly failed to heed her warnings that we could lose in the courts and needed other options as well as a much tougher approach.'

The source added: 'Now we are miles behind in the polls. The buck stops with Sunak.'

In an interview with the Mail On Sunday, Mrs Braverman warned Mr Sunak he was 'running out of time' ahead of the general election to deliver on his promise to stop the boats.

She said: 'I welcome the PM's announcement that he wants to introduce emergency legislation, something for which I've been calling for several months, which he blocked.

'I'm very glad he changed his view in the last few days but this needs to be meaningful change in the law and tweaking and fine-tuning is not going to cut it... and we will not get flights off before the next general election.'

Meanwhile, the Telegraph reported the PM will station more Home Office officials in Rwanda in order to support the east African country's asylum system.

It was claimed the action would be seen as vindication for Mrs Braverman, who pressed for the move while home secretary.

A senior Government source told the newspaper that preparations were underway to 'step up Home Office people who will be doing training and assisting with case working in Rwanda, so that their system is as robust as possible'.

They added that Supreme Court judges, when they ruled on ministers' plans, had not been able to take into account the 'additional work' that has been taking place with Rwanda over the past year to improve the country's processes.

Another senior Government source pointed out the Home Office already had officials in Rwanda in an advisory role, and had done for a long time before the Supreme Court ruling or Mrs Braverman's departure as home secretary.

The Home Office said it would not comment on speculation around future ways of working.

A Government spokesman told the Sun on Sunday: 'As the PM has set out, we were prepared for all outcomes of the Supreme Court case.

'That is why we have been working on a treaty with Rwanda, providing a guarantee in law that those re-located there will be protected against being removed.

'And we'll bring in emergency legislation to end the merry-go-round of litigation in our domestic courts.

The government's plan to deport asylum seekers to Rwanda is ""probably dead"" after it was ruled unlawful this week by the Supreme Court, one of its former justices has said.

The court confirmed its ""unanimous"" decision on Wednesday after 18 months of legal battles, saying those sent to the country would be at ""real risk"" of being returned home, whether their grounds to claim asylum were justified or not - breaching international law.

Politics live: Chancellor 'wants to lower tax burden'

Prime Minister Rishi Sunak has pledged to push on with the scheme - which aims to deter asylum seekers travelling to the country on small boats - promising to turn the agreement with the east African nation into a legally binding treaty to allay the court's fears, and to change the law in the UK to define Rwanda as a ""safe country"".

And Chancellor Jeremy Hunt told Sky News' Sunday Morning with Trevor Phillips it was the government's ""plan"" to bring forward the new treaty and legislation quickly.

But speaking on the same programme, Lord Sumption said such measures ""wouldn't work internationally"", adding it was not a proposal to change the law ""but to change the facts"".

MPs on the right of the Conservative Party have been up in arms since the ruling - including the recently sacked home secretary Suella Braverman, who has demanded the government withdraws from international treaties like the European Human Rights Convention or ignores the obligations to ensure the Rwanda scheme can go ahead.

But Lord Sumption called that option ""extreme"".

Defending the court's ruling, he said: ""They carefully avoided the political broader merits of the Rwanda project. They confined themselves to looking at whether Rwanda was a safe place to send people to. That was the sole issue.

""And what they decided was that it wasn't because Rwanda's record of expelling refugees to places which are or may be unsafe was bad, and because Rwanda just didn't have the cultural, administrative or political substructure which was necessary to perform an agreement of that sort.""

The peer added: ""You can't in a matter of weeks or months or even years simply turn a country like that into one with an impartial civil service, an independent judiciary and the whole administrative culture.

""Ultimately, what the main problem about this scheme is that it outsources to Rwanda the decision about whether people have refugee status or not. And Rwanda just is not up to the job.""

Lord Sumption said changing the UK law to insist the country is safe may work ""domestically"", but even if the government chose to ignore its obligations to international treaties initially, it would ""presumably intend to comply"" with final orders from the European court.

Asked by Trevor Phillips if the scheme was now ""dead"" as a result of the Supreme Court ruling, the peer said: ""I think the current Rwanda's scheme is probably dead, but we obviously have to suspend judgements until we see what this legislation or this new treaty looks like.

""There are other possibilities. They're not terribly attractive, but they do exist.""

Asked if he was comfortable with a change in the law to ensure the Rwanda scheme could push ahead, Mr Hunt told Trevor Phillips: ""Yes, that is our democratic right as members of parliament, we made that commitment to the British people.""

On small boat crossings, the chancellor said the government was ""making progress, but we haven't yet finished the job"", adding: ""We've been very clear we will do what it takes because a government's job is to secure borders.

New law, to come into force next January, will enable easier enforcement of cross-border court rulings, Hong Kong and mainland-qualified lawyer says

A new law that will allow reciprocal enforcement of court judgments in Hong Kong and mainland China in civil and commercial cases will not damage the interests of businesses based in the city, but will reduce costs involved in re-litigation, legal experts have said.

The city lawyers defended the new system on Sunday after Paul Lam Ting-kwok, the justice secretary, acted to clear up confusion over the change.

Tony Au Siu-hong, a Hong Kong lawyer also qualified to practice in the mainland, dismissed claims that the new arrangement would harm the interests of Hong Kong residents and overseas investors and insisted it would offer better safeguards for cross-border deals.

“For example, if the mainland side breaches a contract and attempts to delay its responsibility, what the Hong Kong side can do now could be limited even though it had won lawsuits in a mainland court,” he said. “The new regime will change the scene when the relevant judgments can be enforced in Hong Kong.

“Vice versa, it will facilitate those who win in Hong Kong courts to have the judgment enforced in the mainland, if the judgment fulfils the requirements in the registration process.”

Au also emphasised that the changes only covered designated mainland courts, not “any local-level courts where their impartiality could be questioned” and that the safeguards were in line with international practices.

The new cross-border law will come into force on January 29 next year, five years after a consultation paper was issued.

It will widen the scope of existing legislation to cover civil and commercial matters for reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments by courts across the border.

The two present legal mechanisms only apply to some monetary judgments and matrimonial or family cases.

Lam acted after rumours circulated that the assets and legal rights of businesses would be unprotected under the new regime.

He wrote a detailed defence on his Facebook page on Saturday to dispel two misconceptions created by what he called false and misleading commentaries”.

The post came three days after the announcement of the start date for the new arrangements and at a time when city authorities have been working to attract new investment and talent to boost the economy amid a muted post-pandemic recovery.

The first misconception Lam tackled was that mainland judgments would not become “automatically applicable in Hong Kong” and that city courts would not directly freeze the assets of a party in line with mainland judgments without a hearing.‘Tell story of Hong Kong’s legal system’: call for city’s lawyers to be ‘envoys’

He added no “sharing of judicial information” would take place between the separate courts.

The new ordinance says a cross-border enforcement could be refused if the relevant party was not given a reasonable opportunity to defend the case, the mainland judgment was obtained by fraud, or the parties had started legal proceedings in Hong Kong before the mainland court took on the case.

Under the Foreign Judgments (Reciprocal Enforcement) Ordinance, judgments from about 15 jurisdictions are enforceable in Hong Kong.

These include court decisions from Australia, Singapore and France.

Common law applies as the legal framework for recognition and enforcement of foreign judgments in the city for other jurisdictions.

Nick Chan Hiu-fung, a lawyer and the chairman of the Hong Kong General Chamber of Commerce’s legal committee, said the rumours were a “misinformation campaign” designed to trick the international business community in Hong Kong.

“Some people who had lost lawsuits in the mainland or elsewhere might choose to launch new lawsuits here in Hong Kong,” he said. “By doing this, they buy time to move assets away from home but this could result in the delay of justice.

“This arrangement could reduce these legal tricks, in turn benefiting the legal system and the economy.”Hong Kong can ‘use unique assets to help further develop international trade laws’

He added that, with increased cross-border trade economic activities, the regime would instead help businesses slash the costs required for re-litigation of cases and achieve justice.

Lam’s post underlined that the legal change would provide sufficient protection, as well as fair balance between the legal interests of parties engaged in cross-border business.

He said the city’s Department of Justice and the Supreme People’s Court in the mainland would organise a seminar on the day when the new arrangement came into force.

Lau Siu-kai, a consultant for Beijing’s semi-official think tank, the Chinese Association of Hong Kong and Macau Studies, said authorities of both sides should act fast to further ease investors’ concerns, especially when Hong Kong, a global financial hub, had set ambitious investment targets.

“Hong Kong’s role as an international legal and dispute resolution hub has been valued by the central government,” Lau said. “The arrangement will allow Hong Kong’s independent judiciary to maintain its reputation while enforcing mainland court judgments.

Like the entire country, I was absolutely horrified to discover that the UK's courts and laws were being abused by this appalling individual.

I was disgusted to learn how, at the 11th hour, his deportation was abandoned when plane passengers, unaware of his crime and apparently feeling sorry for him, intervened and insisted he be escorted off the flight due to take him out of the country.

I was absolutely determined to meet Ahmed's victim because I wanted to help give her voice back and support her in getting justice for the abhorrent crime she endured. My meeting with 'Hannah' in 2020 was deeply personal and profoundly moving.

That was why, as Home Secretary, I took such a deep and personal interest in the shocking case of Yaqub Ahmed and the gross injustice that was being endured by his victim

It was clear to me that the immigration and asylum system was working against the interests of a British citizen who was the victim of the most horrendous crime.

Home Office officials often thought it was unusual when I wanted to speak to victims of crime, but for me this was an essential part of my role.

Government should stop its dithering

During our conversation, Hannah openly spoke of the vile crime committed against her, the shattering impact it had, and how incredibly difficult she found it to rebuild her life. What struck me more than anything was her bravery and the extraordinary strength of her resolve.

She was determined to see justice and wanted to work with me to ensure this appalling person was removed from our country.

Among the many egregious elements of this case, Ahmed had the audacity to try to use our modern slavery laws to keep himself in this country. This was one of many insults to this poor woman and, quite frankly, it was one of the many failings in our criminal justice system that this could be allowed to happen. His case also included an outrageous attempt to circumvent our laws by using a fake video to try to dupe the courts.

Like the entire country, I was absolutely horrified to discover that the UK's courts and laws were being abused by this appalling individual

I knew from day one of becoming Home Secretary that the endless appeals and legal merry-go-round in our immigration courts and tribunals was totally unacceptable. But the Ahmed case was a tipping point for me, particularly because of the fabricated video and concocted death threat he used to try to stay in the UK.

It was because of this, and other shocking cases, that I brought in new laws to usher in sweeping changes to the immigration and asylum system.

Some of these changes, however, have still not been implemented.

For example, the Nationality and Borders Act, which our Conservative Government passed, despite relentless opposition from Labour. As part of this Act, Ministers were given the power to remove people more easily from the UK who have no right to be here through a new 'one-stop' process. This would require all asylum, human rights, protection or modern slavery claims to be made up front to stop the absurd circus of legal claims and appeals.

But these important powers have still not been introduced. I urge the Government to pull their fingers out and stop dithering.

I also wanted to encourage the use of so-called wasted cost orders in immigration cases so lawyers who promote spurious immigration cases would have to pick up the court costs.

Frustratingly, that provision - which would stop the extraordinary waste of public money - failed to make it into law because civil servants at the Ministry of Justice were against it.

The British public is understandably fed up with the way our immigration system is abused. We have to ensure that we remove foreign offenders from our country swiftly and that they do not keep hiding behind legal processes. Victims of appalling crimes like Hannah deserve nothing less.

Former President Donald Trump and his legal team have turned New York Attorney General Letitia James' $250 million civil fraud lawsuit into a spectacle, goading Judge Arthur Engoron, politicizing the proceedings, and spectacularly undermining norms of trial behavior.

That pattern continued on Wednesday, when Trump's lawyers filed a motion for a mistrial that claimed Engoron's handling of the trial has been tainted by political bias. (Engoron denied the motion on Friday afternoon.)

Trump's strategy bears a resemblance to tactics employed by the defendants in the notorious ""Chicago Seven"" criminal trial more than 50 years ago, which resulted in the jury convictions being overturned on appeal.

Whether intentional or coincidental, the similarities between these trial strategies are informative -- especially for Engoron.

When legal defense teams push and taunt their presiding judges, they are often hoping to make the judge overreact and make mistakes. If judges do take this bait and make errors, an appellate court could potentially conclude that the trial was unfair and reverse the judgment.

The four-month Chicago trial, which took place between 1969 and 1970, was chaotic and political. Eight defendants were originally charged with violating the Federal Anti-Riot Act, 18 U.S.C. 2101, along with additional crimes in connection with violent encounters between Chicago police and demonstrators protesting the Democratic National Convention in August 1968.

A mistrial was declared for defendant Bobby Seale, whom the judge had ordered bound and gagged in the courtroom for a portion of the trial (he was convicted of multiple charges of contempt of court). Two others were acquitted on all charges, and the remaining five were acquitted on some charges but found guilty of violating the Anti-Riot Act.

The appeals court, in reversing those five Anti-Riot Act convictions, noted that the courtroom was often in an ""uproar,"" and criticized the ""provocative, sometimes insulting, language and activity by several defendants."" But, the court noted, such bad behavior did not excuse errors by the trial judge. ""There are high standards for the conduct of judges and prosecutors, and impropriety by persons before the court does not give license to depart from those standards,"" reads the decision, which notes that the ""district judge's deprecatory and often antagonistic attitude toward the defense is evident in the record from the very beginning.""

In New York, Engoron has used strident language in rejecting Trump's legal positions, terming them ""pure sophistry,"" ""risible,"" ""bogus arguments"" and ""egregious"" in his summary judgment opinion. He sanctioned five Trump attorneys $7,500 each for the ""borderline frivolous"" arguments in their briefs.

Harsh language isn't a problem if it's justified. But the more Engoron pushes the envelope, the more he risks an appellate court disagreeing with his assessment. And Trump's lawyers can and will argue the judge's rhetoric is evidence of judicial bias.

And Engoron has already been reversed by the New York appellate court, which ruled that the judge should have dismissed Ivanka Trump as a defendant due to the statute of limitations.

Engoron's interactions with his law clerk, and the drama that has surrounded them, are another area of concern. Trump has repeatedly criticized the clerk, making false statements about her that the court found had precipitated threats of violence. When Trump twice violated a gag order prohibiting such remarks, he was fined $15,000.

The presence of law clerks at all levels of the federal and state judiciaries is ubiquitous. Justices of the U.S. Supreme Court, for example, have four law clerks each. Engoron having a law clerk to assist him is commonplace. Less common is a law clerk who sits next to the judge, repeatedly exchanging notes.

When challenged that the clerk was acting as co-judge and creating an appearance of bias, Engoron was defiant: ""I am 1,000% convinced that you don't have any right or reason to complain about my confidential communications,"" Engoron said.

Courts have ruled that the communications between a law clerk and a judge are immune from disclosure. But ironically that secrecy could bolster Trump's argument on appeal, since the content of the notes cannot be examined to determine if the messages were proper.

Engoron's issuance of gag orders barring Trump and his lawyers from commenting about his law clerk both publicly and in court sessions is also facing scrutiny by a higher court. On Thursday, a New York appellate judge temporarily halted Engoron's gag orders, citing First Amendment protections. An appellate court panel is scheduled to evaluate the issue on Nov. 27.

So here again we have Engoron committing a potentially unnecessary unforced error. Instead of trying to mitigate risk, he is clearly allowing emotion to color his responses.

And there are other examples of Engoron seemingly overreacting in response to relentless complaining from Trump's lawyers.

Obviously, Trump's civil trial is very different from the Chicago Seven trial, a criminal proceeding with a jury, in multiple important ways. And the appeals court cited multiple reasons to reverse the Chicago convictions.

But Engoron would be wise to consider the lessons of that case nonetheless. He needs to take all necessary steps to ensure that a New York appellate court cannot overturn his decision. And that means not reacting to Trump's hate-filled speech, or to his lawyers' baiting and provocation. It's simply not worth it.","{'uri': 'msnbc.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'MSNBC.com'}",[],"https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_nbcnews-fp-1024-512,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2023-11/231118-engoron-trump-mjf-1530-5f7504.jpg",eng-9072064,-0.4588235294117647,25,25,MSNBC.com,msnbc.com

A coalition of organisations championing press freedom have rallied behind the award-winning Observer and Guardian journalist Carole Cadwalladr, stating they are ""deeply disappointed"" she has been refused permission to appeal against a ruling that ordered her to pay significant legal costs to the prominent Brexit backer Arron Banks.

The supreme court refused to let Cadwalladr contest a cost order six months ago making the journalist responsible for hundreds of thousands of pounds of Banks's legal costs. The coalition, which includes Index on Censorship, the Guardian, the Observer and Reporters Without Borders UK among others, warns that the decision risks stifling public interest journalism in the UK.

Cadwalladr's legal team confirmed on Saturday, however, that the fight was not over, revealing that they would be taking the case to Strasbourg.

Gavin Millar KC said: ""Carole established that over 90% of the publications Banks sued on were lawful public interest speech. So her lawyers believe the order for her to pay 60% of Banks' costs was a penalty which violated her right to journalistic freedom of expression under article 10 [of the European Convention on Human Rights]. We will seek a ruling to this effect from the European Court of Human Rights.""

Millar's intervention arrived as the UK Anti-Slapp Coalition - campaigning against what it calls ""abusive lawsuits filed by a private party with the purpose of silencing critical speech"" - issued a statement of support for Cadwalladr.

""It is important to reassert that Banks was only successful on less than 10% of the publications he sued on. Yet the application of the UK costs rules for libel means that Carole is now expected to pay a six-figure sum. We cannot have a level playing field when lodging a defence or fighting a case through different courts can threaten your livelihood or render you bankrupt,"" the coalition said.

The supreme court recently ordered that ""permission to appeal be refused because the proposed appeal does not raise an arguable point of law"". It added that the supreme court could not interfere with the court of appeal's discretion to award costs, unless the court ""erred in principle or exercised its discretion in an unreasonable manner, and neither of those conditions is met"".

Banks, who donated a record £8m to the pro-Brexit Leave.EU campaign group, sued over comments made by Cadwalladr in a Ted talk and a tweet in 2019. He originally lost his case.

Mrs Justice Steyn found Cadwalladr's remarks were protected when she made them because they were part of reporting on a matter of ""real and abiding public interest"", and her belief that publishing those remarks was in the public interest was a reasonable one for her to hold.

The judge also ruled that the public interest defence fell away from April 2020, when the Electoral Commission issued a statement confirming it accepted an earlier National Crime Agency conclusion that there was no evidence that Banks had broken the law. But she found Banks had not suffered serious harm as a result of the continuing publication. Steyn added that it was ""neither fair nor apt to describe this as a Slapp suit"".

Banks then went to the court of appeal, which partially ruled in his favour, concluding serious harm had been caused by the continuing publication of the words complained of in the Ted talk after April 2020. It did not overturn the public interest defence of the original reporting, which the appeal court recognised ""absorbed most of the time and money"". The parties later agreed that Cadwalladr should pay £35,000 in damages for the continued publication.

However, the costs ruling required Cadwalladr to cover 60% of Banks's legal bills for the original case, repay some money he had been ordered to pay her in respects of her costs for the original hearing, and pay one-third of his legal costs for the appeal, a sum amounting to hundreds of thousands of pounds.

Following that ruling, Banks said: ""In my opinion, this case is being driven by Cadwalladr's lawyers, who banked the win.""","{'uri': 'theguardian.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","[{'uri': 'mark_townsend@theguardian.com', 'name': 'Mark Townsend', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': False}]",https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/48add598b547e4f61031c8cfd152970d3bb5df39/0_593_3712_2226/master/3712.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdG8tZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&s=76d40b2fb7d76c852d1b41d2bba1f2ef,,0.1686274509803922,25,25,The Guardian,theguardian.com

The Home Office's approach to tackling county lines drug operations is based on unproven assumptions and ""racialised tropes"" that criminalise Black boys and young men, according to new research.

The study also found that the policing strategy towards county lines stigmatised Black youngsters in a similar way to how the Metropolitan police's discredited gang violence matrix database was found to be discriminatory.

The findings, published by thinktank the Institute of Race Relations (IRR), says the government's claim that county lines is the ""most violent and exploitative"" drugs distribution model, requiring a multi-agency approach, is unproven. ""There is a dearth of evidence to support the contention of an increase in the use and supply of [Class A] drugs as a result of 'county lines',"" said the IRR study.

Niamh Eastwood, executive director of drugs charity Release, said the study highlighted growing concerns about the strategy: ""The county lines narrative has been used by government and police as a contrived new threat that falsely and cruelly legitimises the targeting of racialised communities, especially of young Black children and men.""

The IRR tried to identify the ethnicity of people considered ""at risk"" of involvement in county lines by the Met, but said its freedom of information request had not been answered. However, available data indicates that, by 2020, of 3,290 people ""having a link or suspected link"" to county lines in London, 83% belonged to an ethnic minority.

The research, published this week in the journal Race & Class, adds that young Black people are up to six times more likely than any other ethnicity to be included in county lines safeguarding classifications. A national child safeguarding review panel also identified a concerning ""over-representation"" of Black boys in those considered at risk from county lines.

The IRR's director, Liz Fekete, said the research should serve as a ""wake-up call"" to councils and safeguarding officials about the perils of being drawn into racial profiling. She urged them to urgently review procedures and databases. ""We need to ensure that they are not complicit in a new form of criminalisation of Black and minority ethnic children, particularly those excluded from school, and/or in care,"" she said.

Lauren Wroe, one of the study's authors, said: ""While we don't see enough action from government on child poverty - itself partly the result of austerity politics - we have witnessed rampant campaigns against so-called grooming gangs, child traffickers and now county lines gangs.""

Wroe, assistant professor in the sociology department at Durham University, added: ""The government throws these issues into the spotlight in an attempt to ramp up support for policies that are tough on crime and tough on immigration, while it fails to address the entrenched inequalities it has created over the last decade.""

The Home Office began outlining attempts to tackle county lines in 2017, and a detailed programme unveiled four years ago has led to more than 14,800 arrests and another 7,200 individuals being referred by police to safeguarding initiatives.

Government officials use county lines as a term to describe ""gangs and organised criminal networks involved in exporting illegal drugs into one or more importing areas within the UK"".

However, the IRR report says the drugs model entered the policy agenda as a culmination of local ""problem profiling"" carried out under the now defunct Ending Gangs and Youth Violence (EGYV) programme and other former anti-gangs policies.

They warn its county lines strategy risks repeating some of the failings of the Met's matrix database, which is being overhauled after the force admitted its operation was unlawful.

The report, by three leading experts in criminal justice and social policy, says that questions need to be asked over the adoption of the relatively ""new crime label"" of county lines, the multi-agency policing of the issue and subsequent prosecution of young men under the Modern Slavery Act.

""At the extreme end, this can culminate in a new racialised trope of young black men as 'the new slave masters of today',"" states their report.

It also found that safeguarding procedures are not protecting young people in a way they were meant to. ""Safeguarding professionals often deploy arbitrary distinctions between victim and offender, gang member and associate,"" the report says.

Angélique Vassell, founder of WalkwithMeUK, a London-based group working with families of colour whose children have been exploited, said: ""The overarching heartache for many families that we support is that they want to be protected as opposed to being neglected and criminalised.""

Eastwood said: ""This groundbreaking and excellent research adds to the evidence that the drug war is a racist endeavour that harms communities and fails to protect society as a whole.""

The National Police Chiefs' Council lead for county lines, Commander Paul Brogden, told the Observer: ""County lines drug dealing destroys lives and we are committed to tackling the supply of illegal drugs, and the exploitation and violence that is frequently associated with it.

""County Lines remains a top priority for policing, and drug gangs across the UK were targeted recently in our latest national police operation, the county lines intensification week.

""The figures from this intensification week demonstrate our work to protect communities from harm, with 710 individuals safeguarded, including 58 children.

""We work closely with key partners, such as Catch22 and Rescue and Response, to help protect young people from county lines across our taskforce model.

""In the last 18 months, one such taskforce team, working at the Metropolitan police, has rescued 52 children from county lines, 63% of whom were Black children.""

Brogden added: ""They also work hard to stop the exploitation of those children, and since the taskforce's inception in 2019, 95 individuals have been charged with modern slavery offences.""

The Home Office said: ""County lines is a major cross-cutting issue involving drugs, violence, gangs, child criminal exploitation, modern slavery and missing persons, which is why a multi-agency response is needed. The government is delivering a series of actions as part of the Inclusive Britain strategy to improve accountability and transparency across policing, and build trust between police and the communities they serve.""","{'uri': 'theguardian.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","[{'uri': 'mark_townsend@theguardian.com', 'name': 'Mark Townsend', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': False}]",https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8e49a5b62b29868af943b3f4b481d69cf6a46e88/0_71_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdG8tZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&s=5024be96496322c83e2ddac109e2a63c,,-0.1529411764705882,25,25,The Guardian,theguardian.com

Attorney General John Formella identified the suspect in Friday's shooting as 33-year-old John Madore. Formella said Madore was homeless and had recently spent time at a hotel on the Seacoast and then in Concord.

After the shooting, a U-Haul truck was found idling in the hospital's parking lot. New Hampshire State Police Col. Mark Hall said the bomb squad inspected the truck and determined it wasn't a public safety threat. Inside the truck, an AR-style rifle, tactical vest and several rounds of ammunition were found. Formella didn't confirm if it was connected to Madore.

The security officer killed in the shooting was identified as 63-year-old Bradley Haas, a veteran of the Franklin Police Department and the department's former chief. After Haas was shot, Hall said a state trooper assigned to the hospital responded immediately shot and killed Madore. The trooper's identity won't be released until an investigation is completed. Formella said several other people were in the lobby at the time but didn't say if they were patients, staff or visitors.

""Chief Haas dedicated 26 years to the city and department, culminating in his tenure as chief. He retired in 2008. He continued to dedicate his time to the NH community by service as a security officer and protecting those at the NH State Hospital,"" the Franklin Police Department said in a statement on Facebook.

Autopsies are being done on Madore and Haas Saturday.

""Make no mistake, if not for the heroics and sacrifice of Bradley Haas, the bravery of the New Hampshire Hospital staff, the unflinching response of New Hampshire State Police, this tragedy could have been much, much worse,"" said Gov. Chris Sununu. ""New Hampshire owes a debt of gratitude to them all.""

After more than a month on the run, a murder suspect who was among four escapees from a Macon, Georgia jail has been recaptured following a multi-week manhunt.

Joey Travis Fournier, 52, was apprehended Saturday around noon near Stockbridge, Georgia, according to Bibb County Sheriff's Office. Fournier was being held in the Bibb County detention center on a murder charge, police said.

Fournier had been on the run since October 16 when he escaped from Bibb County Jail along with three other men, Marc Kerry Anderson, Johnifer Dernard Barnwell, and Chavis Demaryo Stokes.

The UK's highest court ruled against Rishi Sunak's plans to deport all illegal migrants to Rwanda, saying it breached at least five UK laws and four international conventions.

This led to Mr Sunak becoming 'furious', despite the news inflation had halved.

'For 46 minutes, government good news led BBC News,' one official told The Times.

'Then the ruling came - joy turned to despair. Confusion and chaos reigned.

'Number 10 were firing in loads of questions to the Home Office, asking random questions on figures such as arrests and deportations.

'They were just trying to get through the day.'

But Mr Sunak announced the government will introduce emergency legislation to get flights to Rwanda off the ground.

In a press conference on Wednesday evening, he said this new legislation will enable parliament to 'confirm' that 'Rwanda is safe' and end a 'merry-go-round' of legal challenges.

He added the government is working on a new international treaty with Rwanda, which will 'provide a guarantee in law that those who are relocated from the UK to Rwanda will be protected against removal from Rwanda and it will make clear that we will bring back anyone if ordered to do so by a court'.

It followed Mr Sunak sacking Suella Braverman as home secretary and the subsequent cabinet reshuffle, which included the surprise appointment of David Cameron as foreign secretary.

New home secretary James Cleverly confirmed the government still plans to run deportation flights to Rwanda in the future, after the Supreme Court ruled they currently cannot go ahead.

The controversial scheme forms a cornerstone of Rishi Sunak's flagship promise to 'stop the boats', with ministers arguing the prospect of deportation would act as a deterrent to drive down the number of people crossing the English Channel.","{'uri': 'metro.co.uk', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'Metro'}","[{'uri': 'brooke_davies@metro.co.uk', 'name': 'Brooke Davies', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': False}]",https://metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/SEI_180311942-9bd9.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&crop=0px%2C176px%2C2500px%2C1313px&resize=1200%2C630,eng-9063836,-0.04313725490196074,25,25,Metro,metro.co.uk

SUELLA Braverman sent Rishi Sunak six letters during her year as Home Secretary warning his Rwanda plan risked being a failure.

But the PM ""failed to heed"" her warnings, The Sun on Sunday has been told.

The bombshell claims pile yet more pressure on Mr Sunak, who is facing the biggest crisis of his time in No 10.

Furious Conservative MPs are in open revolt after he sacked her and lost the Supreme Court Rwanda ruling in a turbulent 48 hours.

A Tory source said: ""Suella was always clear about what was needed to stop the boats from the minute she came in as Home ­Secretary. That never changed.

""It was very tense at times -- she got more of what she wanted in negotiations, but never enough.

""Rishi and No 10 repeatedly failed to heed her warnings that we could lose in the courts and needed other options as well as a much tougher approach.""

The source added: ""Now we are miles behind in the polls. The buck stops with Sunak.""

And, in a blistering interview with the Mail on Sunday, she also accused the PM of lacking ""moral leadership"" by not coming down hard enough over the recent pro-Palestine marches.

Ms Braverman said: ""We've seen hundreds of thousands of people take to the streets on a weekly basis chanting anti-Semitic slogans, celebrating acts of terrorism, threatening community cohesion and undermining British values.

""There had been tepid and timid statements from the Prime Minister throughout the course of this issue and I felt there was a real opportunity for him to demonstrate some moral leadership, to demonstrate this is not what Britain stands for, that we are an inclusive, tolerant and respectful nation whereby violence on the streets is unacceptable.

""I felt that was wholly lacking.""

She said the police had ""let down the British people, let down the Jewish community"".

She added: ""What we've seen on the streets of Britain really reflects a very high risk of radicalisation, extremism and anti-Semitism.""

Ms Braverman said Mr Sunak must ""change course urgently"" to avoid electoral oblivion.

Her explosive comments come after a hellish week for Mr Sunak, whose party is once again descending into civil war.

After months of bitter rows, the PM brutally sacked Ms Braverman in a short phone call on Monday.

But the move deeply divided his party.

Some Conservatives privately hailed her departure, but others on the Right were spitting feathers.

Two days later, the PM suffered his biggest blow since moving into No 10 when the Supreme Court ruled against his flagship Rwanda deportation scheme.

Furious Mr Sunak slammed the verdict and vowed to do whatever it takes to get deportation flights off the ground.

He is bringing forward his Plan B ""within days"".

This includes a new legal treaty with Rwanda and emergency legislation declaring the country safe.

But Ms Braverman has warned this will flop unless Mr Sunak finally takes her advice and opts Britain out of human rights laws.

She has accused him of ""magical thinking"" and warned ""tinkering"" will not stop the boats.

Last night, No 10 hit back at claims Ms Braverman privately agitated for a tougher course of action.

A government spokesman said: ""As the Prime Minister has set out, we were prepared for all outcomes of the Supreme Court case.

""That is why we have been working on a treaty with Rwanda, providing a guarantee in law that those relocated there will be protected against being removed.

""And we'll bring in emergency legislation to end the merry-go-round of litigation in our domestic courts.

""We are fully focused on making our Rwanda plan operational as swiftly as possible, delivering on our commitment to stop the boats.""

The Tory Party has been plunged into a fresh bout of infighting over what the Government's response to the Supreme Court should be.

Some have suggested the Conservatives are hurtling towards a fresh Brexit-style split over whether or not to quit the ECHR.

Sir Jacob Rees-Mogg, writing in today's Sun on Sunday, said: ""The frustration with this Government is not that it is bad or incompetent, but that it is always just too late.""

The Rwandan government has slammed the Supreme Court ruling.

Writing in today's Sun on ­Sunday, spokeswoman Yolande Makolo said: ""The Supreme Court's highly political judgment on the Migration and Economic Development Partnership was insulting to my country.""

Right-wing Tory MPs want Mr Sunak to adopt Ms Braverman's approach and toughen the law so we opt out of human rights laws for borders policy.

Some inside the Government have dismissed it as ""legal voodoo"" that will not work.

But this risks sparking a row within the Conservative Party as many Tory MPs loathe the idea of quitting our international human rights obligations.

Either way, No 10 and the Tory Party are braced for a giant dust- up with the House of Lords over the Rwanda Plan B.

Former Cabinet minister Sir Simon Clarke wants the Government to call a snap election if the Lords block it.","{'uri': 'thesun.co.uk', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'The Sun'}","[{'uri': 'kate_ferguson@thesun.co.uk', 'name': 'Kate Ferguson', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': False}]",https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/newspress-collage-24782275-1700337370352.jpg?1700337384&strip=all&quality=100&w=1920&h=1080&crop=1,eng-9063836,-0.3725490196078431,25,25,The Sun,thesun.co.uk

The final verdict is in: the supreme court last week upheld the court of appeal's judgment that deporting asylum seekers to Rwanda is unlawful , because it would be unsafe for them. It means that Rishi Sunak must return to the drawing board his flagship policy aimed at reducing the number of people trying to get to the UK to seek refuge by detaining those who do and sending a small fraction to Rwanda for their claims to be assessed and granted there. But, while the supreme court judgment underlines the immorality of the UK seeking to shirk its international responsibilities on refugee protection, even had the courts ruled the policy lawful, it would not have had the deterrent effect the prime minister has promised voters.

In June, the court of appeal assessed the evidence and ruled that deporting asylum seekers to Rwanda was unlawful due to the risk that people with valid asylum claims who were sent to Rwanda would be returned to their home countries, where they would face persecution or inhumane treatment. The supreme court also looked at a breadth of evidence and unanimously concluded that the court of appeal was right to reach this judgment. It cited evidence for Rwanda's poor human rights record, including extrajudicial killings, enforced disappearances and torture; serious defects in Rwanda's asylum processes, including an untested right to appeal; its surprisingly high rejection rates for countries in known conflict zones; and its failures to honour an agreement with Israel, which tried a similar scheme, not to deport asylum seekers with valid claims to their home countries. The judges made clear that this evidence would have put the UK not just in breach of the European convention on human rights but of many other international treaties ratified by the UK as well as several domestic statutes.

Extraordinarily, the Conservatives' deputy chairman, Lee Anderson, reacted by saying that the government should break the law and deport people to Rwanda anyway. Ministers have unsurprisingly distanced themselves from this call worthy of a dictator. Instead, the prime minister has announced his intention to sign a binding treaty with Rwanda in place of the existing memorandum, and pass domestic legislation that would guarantee any further legal challenge would fail.

This will not work on several levels. Signing a binding treaty with Rwanda around how it processes asylum claims - even if it promises not to deport those who are not granted asylum, as hinted at by a Rwandan government official last week - will not in itself overturn the evidence that the system is unsafe and that Rwanda has a track record of not honouring agreements in this area with third countries. It is also not clear how primary legislation could prevent a further challenge to a reformulated scheme in the UK courts, and or even how the government could get this legislation through the House of Lords in the next year. The chances of the government being able to begin deportations to Rwanda before a general election are minuscule.

But perhaps that is Sunak's intention. He will know as well as anyone how unlikely he is to achieve this. He will also know how unlikely his policy is to have the deterrent effect that he claims: there is strong evidence that deporting a fraction of asylum seekers who come to the UK to Rwanda will have little impact, as even the Home Office's own internal analysis concludes. Instead, through its Illegal Migration Act the government has created a need to detain what will probably be hundreds of thousands of people - most of whom would be granted refugee status - arriving in the UK through irregular means, with nowhere to send them. It is not only grossly inhumane, it is completely impracticable.

Which leaves the impression that the prime minister's true intent is not to stop the small boats but to pick a fight with judges in the desperate hope that voters will then blame others for the government's failures on asylum policy. A populist strategy, with echoes of Brexit: blame someone else for a country's malaise, proffer a solution you claim is the answer to everything but is no such thing, and convince voters that you are the only person who can deliver it. But the Conservatives' dire poll ratings should serve as a warning that this strategy never works in the medium term.

In the meantime, the real problems in the refugee system will continue to get worse. That is not numbers: the UK is home to a tiny fraction of the world's refugees; we host just 230,000 refugees compared with 2.1 million in Germany and 3.6 million in Turkey. The biggest issue is the huge backlog in processing claims, which has got much worse in recent years, trapping refugees in abject poverty while they are waiting, and racking up unnecessary costs for the taxpayer.

If Sunak's true motivation were to reduce the number of people losing their lives on the dangerous Channel crossing, he would try to negotiate a returns agreement with France, whereby the UK takes the same number of asylum seekers it returns to France but prioritises those who have family in the UK. Instead, he is pursuing a political strategy that is unlikely to win him votes and will achieve nothing apart from polarising the public conversation about refugees. It will be a sorry legacy indeed.","{'uri': 'theguardian.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'The Guardian'}",[],https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2d4f08f189bbec5b2fed5955bc5e70f820daf1ed/873_96_1245_747/master/1245.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdG8tZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&s=af479ad9b36d110d2baa75b684a0a5a4,eng-9063836,0.2078431372549019,25,25,The Guardian,theguardian.com

A body believed to be Chloe Darnel was discovered and sent to the medical examiner's office in Frankfort for an autopsy and positive identification, according to a Friday statement from the Whitley County Sheriff Department's Facebook page.

In addition to murder, Brittany Slaughter, 24, and Adam Hayes, 34, both of Williamsburg, Kentucky, are charged with abuse of a corpse and tampering with physical evidence, according to the sheriff's department. Slaughter had custody of Chloe, the sheriff's department said.

Chloe ""was a bright happy child"" who was met with an ""unhappy ending,"" according to the GoFundMe account which was organized by a family member. Slaughter is Chloe's aunt, according to fundraiser.

Relatives and friends of the child became suspicious because they were unable to see or talk to the girl for the past month, the GoFundMe said. Chloe had seven siblings, according to the fundraiser.

The suspect in a callous hospital shooting that saw a security guard gunned down in cold blood has been named - as police reveal chilling items were left behind.

John Madore, 33, has been formally identified as the gunman who was responsible for the shooting of multiple victims which led to one person's death at a New Hampshire hospital on Friday, in the US. Madore was killed in a firefight with law enforcement on Friday evening.

New Hampshire Attorney General John Formella confirmed on Saturday morning that Madore was responsible for the attack. He explained that Madore was homeless and spent time in hotels in Seacost and Concord.

The bomb squad were also called to the hospital's carpark following the shooting after a car was found idling. It was eventually deemed safe. However, an AR-style rifle, tactical vest and several rounds of ammunition were found in the truck.

The security guard who was killed during the shooting has also been identified. Bradley Haas, a 63-year-old former police officer of Franklin Police Department was shot and killed at the hospital. Several other people have been confirmed as being in the lobby at the time of the shooting but it is not known if they were staff, patients or visitors.

Victim Haas has been commended for his bravery during the shooting. Gov.

New Hampshire owes a debt of gratitude to them all.""

New Hampshire Hospital is the state psychiatric hospital, located in the state's capital city. It is one of several buildings on a sprawling campus, which also includes Concord District Court, the New Hampshire Department of Labor, the Department of Revenue Administration and Employment Security.

Britain opened its doors to Hong Kong residents in 2021 and more than 160,000 have taken the opportunity to move there under a new visa scheme for British National (Overseas) passport holders.

But the United Kingdom does not welcome all arrivals to its shores. Asylum seekers, claiming they face persecution in their home countries, have faced increasingly tough barriers to entry.

Many have, since 2018, risked their lives by crossing the English Channel in tiny dinghies and boats provided by trafficking gangs. More than 45,000 arrived in 2022 – a record – and a further 27,000 this year.

The trend has become a hot political issue for Prime Minister Rishi Sunak ahead of an election expected next year, with immigration a key concern among supporters of his Conservative Party.

Sunak has vowed to “stop the boats”. But they keep coming. The government hatched an extraordinary plan to solve the problem – send the asylum seekers to Rwanda. But last week, the Supreme Court ruled the scheme unlawful, causing shock and fury in Westminster.Sunak fights to save Rwanda migrants treaty; new plan to be ready in ‘days’

The plan was to fly asylum seekers from Britain to the African country, which would process their claims instead. In return, Britain paid Rwanda an initial £140 million (HK$1.35 billion).

But the UK has an obligation, under international and domestic law, to ensure asylum seekers are not, directly or indirectly, returned to a country where they face persecution.

The Supreme Court found the evidence provided “substantial grounds” for believing migrants sent to Rwanda would face a real risk of such treatment.

Rwanda had agreed to the deal in good faith and given assurances it would comply with international law. But the court highlighted inadequacies in the country’s asylum system, its human rights record, history of sending applicants to other states and failure to honour assurances given in a similar arrangement with Israel. The judges said “intentions and aspirations do not necessarily correspond to reality”, questioning the ability of Rwanda to ensure its promises are met.

This should spell the end for a policy which has, justifiably, been described as cruel, immoral and unworkable. The government insists Rwanda is a “safe third country” for asylum seekers. But in 2021, Britain criticised Rwanda before the United Nations Human Rights Council for “extrajudicial killings, deaths in custody, enforced disappearances and torture”.

Sunak, however, does not appear to have an alternative. He intends to sign a treaty with Rwanda to address the court’s concerns by providing additional reassurance on the treatment of the migrants.

The prime minister even plans to introduce emergency legislation to declare Rwanda safe. As Lord Jonathan Sumption, a part-time judge on Hong Kong’s Court of Final Appeal, told The Times, this amounts to an attempt to “change the facts” from those established by the court. Sunak has even suggested the UK would pull out of the European Convention on Human Rights.

These outrageous attempts to circumvent the courts are not likely to succeed and will undermine Britain’s reputation for adherence to the rule of law. Instead, the government should be looking to provide safe, legal channels for asylum seekers to make their claims and to cut the time taken for processing them.

The treatment of refugees is a global problem. The UN refugee agency reported in 2021 there were 1.4 million in need of resettlement. There are not enough countries willing to take them.

Hong Kong does not grant asylum, but will not return refugees to places where they will be tortured or persecuted. Little more than 1 per cent of applicants succeed with their bids. Those that do can spend many years waiting to be resettled in another country.

The challenge is to establish a system which is both fair and efficient. But the priority, whether in Britain, Hong Kong or elsewhere, must be to ensure the safety of those fleeing persecution and to allow them to start a new life.

As one successful applicant in Hong Kong told the Post: “No one wants to be a refugee.”","{'uri': 'scmp.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'South China Morning Post'}",[],https://cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/og_image_scmp_opinion/public/d8/images/canvas/2023/11/18/88a34ec1-c92b-4d52-ab0b-b19a53182375_8985d721.jpg?itok=2xitjCAb&v=1700315496,eng-9063836,0.04313725490196085,25,25,South China Morning Post,scmp.com

The bus has been missed and there is not another one in sight. This is where we are with the Rwanda policy.

There were things that could have been done and which the Government was advised to do but they have not been done and now the obstacles have grown and an election looms.

Amendments were proposed to this year's Borders bill which would have prevented the Supreme Court from blocking the Rwanda scheme.

In the United Kingdom the highest form of law is that passed by Parliament.

The Courts may interpret it or even declare it incompatible with the European Convention on Human Rights but they cannot override it.

Ultimately, power is with you the voter via your representative in the House of Commons whom you may fire if you are dissatisfied with his performance.

Yet the Government did not make these amendments, it took the risk that it would win in Court and the question is why?

It could be hubris, perhaps the Prime Minister and his legal advisers were confident that he would win or perhaps it was squeamishness.

Those demanding firm action were supporters of Boris and the Government did not want to upset the international elite, the Davos types who prefer international symposiums to domestic democracy.

Either way it has not worked and now time is against the Government which does not seem too have been prepared.

Where is the emergency legislation? Why was a new Bill not put to Parliament on Thursday?

How does the Government propose to get such a Bill through the House of Lords when there is insufficient time to use the Parliament Act?

This lack of foresight makes it highly unlikely that the Rwanda scheme will be operational before the next election but Rishi Sunak must try, his majority depends upon it.

Thus emergency legislation needs to be introduced promptly which gives explicit authority for deportations to Rwanda, it must amend any other laws which are seen as obstacles to this, including the Human Rights Act.

It will probably get stuck in the Lords or the Courts and then it will become a centrepiece of the Election Campaign.

In the meantime legal migration, which is about 15 times the level of the small boats, can be reduced with no Parliamentary or legal fuss and it is, in truth, a bigger issue with greater societal and economic effect.","{'uri': 'thesun.co.uk', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'The Sun'}",[],https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/manchester-jacob-rees-mogg-speaking-849539821-1.jpg?strip=all&quality=100&w=1920&h=1080&crop=1,eng-9063836,-0.02745098039215688,25,25,The Sun,thesun.co.uk

Authorities say the gunman who was killed after shooting to death a security guard at a New Hampshire psychiatric hospital has been identified.

New Hampshire's attorney general, John Formella, said on Saturday that 33-year-old John Madore entered the New Hampshire hospital on Friday afternoon and killed Bradley Haas, a state department of safety security officer who was working at the front lobby entrance of the facility.

All patients at the psychiatric hospital were safe, and the state trooper who killed Madore was not wounded.

Formella said Madore was most recently living in a hotel in the Seacoast region and also had lived in Concord. Investigators are still looking into whether Madore had ties to the hospital or Haas.

The shooting happened around 3.30pm at the New Hampshire hospital and was contained to the front lobby of the 185-bed facility, state police Col Mark Hall said at a news conference. He said CPR was performed on the victim, who later died at Concord hospital.

All patients at the psychiatric hospital were safe, and the state trooper who killed the shooter was not wounded, according to authorities.

""Investigators with the New Hampshire State Police have searched and cleared a suspicious box truck near the scene. They determined the truck poses no safety risk,"" the statement from the attorney general's office said.

Haas lived in Franklin, a small city about 20 miles (32km) from Concord. He worked as a police officer for 28 years and rose to become police chief, according to a statement from the state attorney general's office.

The Franklin police department mourned the death of the former chief, saying he dedicated decades to the city and the police department before retiring in 2008.

""He continued to dedicate his time to the NH community by serving as a security officer helping and protecting those at the NH State Hospital,"" the police department said on its Facebook page. ""The FPD will honor his memory by flying our flags at half staff and wearing mourning bands in our badges.""

No further information was released about the shooter, a possible motive or other details of the attack, but authorities planned to provide an update on the investigation on Saturday morning.

Friday's shooting was the latest act of violence at a US hospital. Medical centers nationwide have struggled to adapt to the growing threats, which have helped make healthcare one of the nation's most violent fields.

It came weeks after 18 people were killed and 13 others injured in a mass shooting in neighboring Maine.

The hospital remained in operation but was closed to visitors on Friday evening.

The facility is the only state-run psychiatric hospital for adults in New Hampshire. Located in the capital city, it is part of a large state office park that includes multiple state agencies and is near the city's high school and district courthouse. The state's department of safety provides security for the hospital.

Democratic representative from New Hampshire Annie Kuster called the shooting ""horrifying.""

""Thank you to the State Police Officers who responded to the scene so quickly,"" Kuster said in a statement. ""My thoughts are with the victim, their family, and the Concord community.""

Other members of the state's congressional delegation also released statements of support.","{'uri': 'theguardian.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'The Guardian'}",[],https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/75537a6954a53d4c0099cd114b41fc35ea4eda09/0_172_5151_3091/master/5151.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&s=22399854946649e037e9a04e78962fe0,spa-3295675,-0.2156862745098039,25,25,The Guardian,theguardian.com

Dr Adriana Copeland, 62, is suing guitarist Summers, 80, claiming he is trying to avoid paying recording royalties in breach of a 1983 management agreement. A High Court claim says three companies set up by the band in 1979 agreed to pay her management company, Firstars Ltd, 25% of earnings, including royalties, in perpetuity.

The model and sculptor turned psychologist, wed to the band's ex-manager Miles Copeland, says she became Summers' exclusive personal manager, as well as the sole manager to lead singer and bassist Sting and drummer Stewart.

The Police in 1980

The band had huge hits with songs including Every Breath You Take, Roxanne and Message In A Bottle. But Dr Copeland says the companies stopped paying commission on royalties to her from digital performances of Police recordings from January 1, 2014.

Sting and Copeland have since paid their share but Summers has not, she claims. She says the figure owed now stands at £150,000. Lancashire-born Summers joined The Police in 1977. After the band split, he continued recording, touring and composing music for films. In March 2017 he formed Call The Police, a Police tribute band.

He now lives in Santa Monica, ­California, with his second wife Kate. They have three children. The claim, filed by Nicholas Berry of solicitors Gunnercooke, was to be heard at London's High Court but has been moves to Central London County Court. Berry and Summers' manager were contacted for comment.","{'uri': 'mirror.co.uk', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'Mirror'}","[{'uri': 'dan_warburton@mirror.co.uk', 'name': 'Dan Warburton', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': False}]",https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article31472187.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/1_MAINSOCIAL.jpg,,0.0117647058823529,25,25,Mirror,mirror.co.uk

U.S. District Judge Miranda Du granted the government's motion to dismiss their assertions that the mine is being built illegally near the sacred site of an 1865 massacre along the Nevada-Oregon line.

But she said in an order this month that the three tribes suing the Bureau of Land Management deserve another chance to amend their complaint to try to prove the agency failed to adequately consult with them as required by the National Historic Preservation Act.

""Given that the court has now twice agreed with federal defendants [and] plaintiffs did not vary their argument ... the court is skeptical that plaintiffs could successfully amend it. But skeptical does not mean futile,"" Du wrote Nov. 9.

She also noted part of their case is still pending on appeal at the 9th U.S Circuit Court of Appeals, which indicated last month it likely will hear oral arguments in February as construction continues at Lithium Nevada's mine at Thacker Pass about 230 miles northeast of Reno.

Du said in an earlier ruling the tribes had failed to prove the project site is where more than two dozen of their ancestors were killed by the U.S. Cavalry Sept. 12, 1865.

Her new ruling is the latest in a series that have turned back legal challenges to the mine on a variety of fronts, including environmentalists' assertions it would violate the 1872 Mining Law and destroy key habitat for sage grouse, cutthroat trout and pronghorn antelope.

All have argued the bureau violated numerous laws in a rush to approve the mine to help meet sky-rocketing demand for lithium used in the manufacture of batteries for electric vehicles.

Lithium Nevada officials said the $2.3-billion project remains on schedule to begin production in late 2026. They say it's essential to carrying out President Biden's clean energy agenda aimed at combating climate change by reducing dependence on fossil fuels.

""We've dedicated more than a decade to community engagement and hard work in order to get this project right, and the courts have again validated the efforts by Lithium Americas and the administrative agencies,"" company spokesman Tim Crowley said in an email to the Associated Press.

Du agreed with the government's argument that the consultation is ongoing and, therefore, not ripe for legal challenge.

The tribes argued it had to be completed before construction began.

""If agencies are left to define when consultation is ongoing and when consultation is finished ... then agencies will hold consultation open forever -- even as construction destroys the very objects of consultation -- so that agencies can never be sued,"" the tribal lawyers wrote in recent briefs filed with the 9th Circuit.

Will Falk, representing the Reno-Sparks Indian Colony and Summit Lake Paiute Tribe, said they're still considering whether to amend the complaint by the Dec. 9 deadline Du set, or focus on the appeal.

""Despite this project being billed as 'green,' it perpetrates the same harm to Native peoples that mines always have,"" Falk told AP. ""While climate change is a very real, existential threat, if government agencies are allowed to rush through permitting processes to fast-track destructing mining projects like the one at Thacker Pass, more of the natural world and more Native American culture will be destroyed.""

The Paiutes call Thacker Pass ""Pee hee mu'huh,"" which means ""rotten moon."" They describe in oral histories how Paiute hunters returned home in 1865 to find the ""elders, women, and children"" slain and ""unburied and rotting.""

The Oregon-based Burns Paiute Tribe joined the Nevada tribes in the appeal. They say BLM's consultation efforts with the tribes ""were rife with withheld information, misrepresentations, and downright lies.""","{'uri': 'latimes.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'Los Angeles Times'}",[],https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/3090117/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5400x3038+0+281/resize/1200x675!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F0c%2Fee%2Fc010e324107f867ae2bf46e18fe4%2Ffcecd47af75b449c9d34338c5d1fba9d,eng-9069138,-0.192156862745098,25,25,Los Angeles Times,latimes.com

A woman who tried to take her own life after a court cleared her ex-partner of coercive control is backing a campaign to open up the justice system.

Charlotte, 30, is supporting the Open Justice campaign, which is calling for a change in the law to make court records freely available. She is just one of the serious crime complainants too traumatised to attend full hearings being asked to pay for court transcripts to understand judges' decisions.

Crown courts can charge ­thousands of pounds for these and magistrates court sessions are not routinely recorded. One rape victim was quoted £7,500 for a transcript of the full trial. It typically costs around £45 to £60 to provide a transcript of a judge's sentencing remarks.

Charlotte, who asked that we not use her last name, was devastated after her ex-partner was cleared of ­coercive control in January. After giving evidence at a magistrates court, she was too upset to attend the rest of the hearing in person.

Justice Secretary Alex Chalk

But she said: ""If I had, I would have been sat in the public gallery next to my ex-partner's sister. I wasn't given the option of watching a video link in a side room so I have no idea what happened in the trial and why the district judge reached the verdict she did.""

Charlotte claims that all she has is a solicitor's note saying the judge thought she was ""unreliable"" because it took her eight months to go to the police. She said: ""My mental health has gone down the drain. The day I got the verdict, I tried to kill myself... I need to know what was said to get closure and move on.""

Charlotte, of Hackney, East London, has joined London's Victims Commissioner, Claire Waxman, to call for crown court sentencing remarks and judges' summing-up to be given for free. They also want crown court sentencing remarks routinely published, magistrate hearings to be recorded and the Victims Code updated to say victims can attend trials after giving evidence.

Charlotte said there are at least 10 people formally involved in the campaign and more backing it. And Lib Dem MP Sarah Olney is among 38 ministers and charities to send Justice Secretary Alex Chalk an open letter highlighting it. She said: ""It beggars belief some victims are charged thousands to read what was said in a trial that impacts them so profoundly. Justice should not have a price tag.""

The Ministry of Justice said judges may provide transcripts to victims at their discretion, adding: ""The fee covers the considerable costs [of] writing up the recording of potentially weeks of hearings.""

Attorney General John Formella identified the suspect in Friday's shooting as 33-year-old John Madore. Formella said Madore was homeless and had recently spent time at a hotel on the Seacoast and then in Concord.

After the shooting, a U-Haul truck was found idling in the hospital's parking lot. New Hampshire State Police Col. Mark Hall said the bomb squad inspected the truck and determined it wasn't a public safety threat. Inside the truck, an AR-style rifle, tactical vest and several rounds of ammunition were found. Formella didn't confirm if it was connected to Madore.

The security officer killed in the shooting was identified as 63-year-old Bradley Haas, a 28-year veteran of the Franklin Police Department and the department's former chief. After Haas was shot, Hall said a state trooper assigned to the hospital responded immediately shot and killed Madore. The trooper's identity won't be released until an investigation is completed.

Please try again later{{ /verifyErrors }}

Donald Trump may still appear on the 2024 primary presidential ballot in Colorado, a state judge ruled - shutting down efforts to remove the former president by invoking the 14th Amendment.

The attempt to remove Mr Trump from the ballot was based on the claim that he is constitutionally barred from office because of the January 6 insurrection.

Earlier, the judge in Donald Trump's civil fraud trial brought against him by New York Attorney General Letitia James threw out the former president's bid for a mistrial.

Justice Arthur Engoron said he could not ""in good conscience"" let Trump pursue a request that was ""utterly without merit.""

The ruling comes after Mr Trump launched a fresh attack on Judge Engoron's court clerk almost as an appeals court judge paused the gag order which was introduced following his previous comments about her on social media.

The former president took to Truth Social to take advantage of the opportunity to attack the judge's ""ridiculous"" and ""unconstitutional"" gag order, and his ""politically biased and out of control, Trump Hating Clerk"".

Meanwhile, in the Washington, DC, federal case against Mr Trump concerning 2020 election interference, Justice Tanya Chutkan denied a motion to remove language relating to violence during the January 6 Capitol riot from the indictment.

The former president's legal team argued the statements were prejudicial but the judge noted the jury would not receive a copy of the indictment.","{'uri': 'independent.co.uk', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'The Independent'}",[],https://static.independent.co.uk/2023/11/17/20/SEI180297119.jpg?quality=75&width=1200&auto=webp,eng-9072064,-0.2784313725490196,25,25,The Independent,independent.co.uk

Welcome to this week's edition of the Deadline: Legal Newsletter, a roundup of top legal stories, including the latest developments from the Supreme Court, Donald Trump's legal cases and more. Click here to have the newsletter delivered straight to your inbox every Friday this Supreme Court term.

The Supreme Court finally released an ethics code this week, but it's barely worth the paper it's printed on. For one thing, as MSNBC Daily columnist Jessica Levinson pointed out, there's no enforcement mechanism. Sure, there's something to be said for the court responding to public scrutiny -- even if half-heartedly and condescendingly -- but this response doesn't inspire confidence in the institution. So it was good to see Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse, D-R.I., of the Judiciary Committee tell Nicolle that he still wants subpoenas for Harlan Crow and Leonard Leo, two of the men behind scandals that prompted scrutiny leading up to the code's begrudging issuance.

Another high court embarrassment this week was called out by Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson. Writing for herself and the other two Democratic appointees, Jackson noted an ""indisputable legal error"" in a solitary confinement case. The lower court had ruled against a prisoner who was kept for years without exercise in an unsanitary cell the size of a parking space. But it takes four justices to review a case, and the irrefutable blunder wasn't enough for a single GOP-appointed justice on the 6-3 court to care. Rather, three of those Republican appointees -- Clarence Thomas, Samuel Alito and Neil Gorsuch -- displayed their priorities when they dissented from their colleagues' declining to grant Florida the ability to enforce its anti-drag law.

Turning, as we inevitably do, to the man who appointed a third of the court, Donald Trump's diverse legal docket continued apace, as he pushed to delay the federal election interference case pending the resolution of his immunity claim. However, the judge presiding over his Washington prosecution, Tanya Chutkan, hasn't seemed eager to entertain Trump's delay attempts ahead of his March trial date. We can't say the same for Trump's appointee in Florida, Aileen Cannon, whose actions continue to call the May classified documents trial date into question.

In his civil fraud trial in Manhattan, Trump's lawyers filed a mistrial motion that doubled as a political screed. In it, they complained that Judge Arthur Engoron and his law clerk are biased against Trump, and that the gag order Engoron imposed because of the former president's statements about the clerk, and the enforcement of that order, are themselves proof of bias. It's hard to take seriously the claim that the gag order that Trump practically begged for shows the judge is biased against him, especially when Engoron has levied only paltry fines when enforcing it.

Trump is also appealing the New York gag order itself (which Engoron extended to Trump's lawyers), and a state appellate judge temporarily lifted it on Thursday. So at least for a time, Trump is ungagged, as it were, because the order limiting his verbal attacks in the federal election case has also been temporarily stayed as he challenges that one, too. Oral argument on the latter order is set for Monday in the Washington federal appeals court.

Meanwhile, in Trump's Georgia case, some of his former co-defendants made waves when media outlets published parts of their proffer videos this week. That's how we learned, for example, that Jenna Ellis said Trump aide Dan Scavino told her their boss wasn't planning on leaving office despite his 2020 election loss to Joe Biden. But could Ellis, a former Trump campaign lawyer who pleaded guilty in a no-jail deal, offer that testimony against Trump if she were called to the stand at trial? I explored the issue here.

And can Trump even become president again in 2024? We saw movement this week in some of the 14th Amendment suits pending across the country. Following last week's Minnesota Supreme Court ruling that punted on the eligibility question, a Michigan judge not only did the same but found the constitutional issue is a ""political"" one for Congress, not courts, to resolve. The Michigan challengers have vowed to appeal, while the Colorado judge presiding over a similar case heard closing arguments this week on whether the amendment's insurrection clause keeps Trump from office. We're awaiting her ruling any day now. Remember, however these initial decisions shake out, the U.S. Supreme Court likely has the final word. But when will we find out either way? As my colleague Hayes Brown explained, it might not be until the very last minute.","{'uri': 'msnbc.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'MSNBC.com'}",[],"https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_nbcnews-fp-1024-512,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2023-11/231117-donald-trump-cs-a813e9.jpg",eng-9072064,0.06666666666666665,25,25,MSNBC.com,msnbc.com

A federal judge has to decide whether sediment runoff from the controversial ""Cop City"" police and fire department training center near Atlanta violates the Clean Water Act and is cause for stopping the project temporarily, after hearing both sides of the argument this week.

The judge may also dismiss the underlying environmental lawsuit, as defendants have asked the court.

At stake is whether construction can continue on the project's 171-acre footprint in a forest south-east of Atlanta if pre-established state limits on sediment running off the site into Intrenchment Creek were already exceeded before the project started, as plaintiffs allege - and are even higher now.

Opposition to the project is in its third year, and entered global headlines after police shot and killed activist Manuel Paez Terán, or ""Tortuguita"", on 18 January, while camped nearby in a forest public park. The killing of the environmental activist was the first of its kind in American history.

The motion for a preliminary injunction pits Atlanta-based environmental group, the South River Watershed Alliance (SRWA), against the city and the Atlanta Police Foundation (APF), the non-profit organization behind the training center project.

If the suit is successful, it could also lead to courts elsewhere being more likely to enforce the federal law, which would help clean up other rivers, said Jon Schwartz, attorney for SRWA. The creek flows into South River, which American Rivers, a national environmental group, named in 2021 as one of ""America's Most Endangered Rivers"".

The plaintiffs filed the motion and the underlying citizen lawsuit based on Clean Water Act violations in August and this week was the earliest a judge could hear arguments on their bid to pause the project, even as clear-cutting and the pouring of cement have continued apace.

One question district court judge - and Trump appointee - Jean-Paul Boulee asked repeatedly underscored the case's importance, as he asked defendants to name a previous district court opinion that offered guidance in considering such a citizen suit. They proffered a supreme court case that involved one state suing another over development affecting water quality.

A central legal issue in the case are 15 words in the state's general permit for development projects, created by the Environmental Protection Division: ""No discharges authorized by this permit shall cause violations of Georgia's in-stream water quality standards"". Those standards - including sediment levels - are set in accordance with the Clean Water Act, and plaintiffs say the project is causing such violations and will continue to do so.

The issue of sediment is not a trivial one, as ""sediment runoff is the No 1 polluter of rivers and streams in the US, and the reason the [federal] Environmental Protection Agency classifies them as 'too dirty' for fish and other fauna"", said Sarah H Ledford, a geosciences professor at Georgia State University.

This runoff then affects macroinvertebrates - insects in their nymph and larval stages, snails, worms, crayfish and clams, for example - which play important roles in aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems.

The city and APF disagreed about sediment levels entering the creek, and also made sweeping arguments about the public interest they say would be impaired if the project is halted even temporarily.

The two-hour hearing was visually striking in its contrasting display of resources, as Schwartz sat on one side facing the judge, while five attorneys sat on the other. The Atlanta chief of police, Darin Schierbaum, also sat in the audience through the proceeding, as did top fire department staff.

When Judge Boulee asked about balancing public interests, Schwartz asserted ""there will no be irreparable harm"" to Atlanta or APF if the project is paused, and that the police will continue to train in existing facilities. Meanwhile, he said, ""you undermine confidence in the rule of law if the city is violating [federal] law"".

But Simon Bloom, attorney for the APF, claimed that the training center ""is the single most important public safety project in decades in this city - maybe since the conversion of buggies to cars"".

He also accused the plaintiffs of having political motivations, not environmental ones, and that not seeing any ""dead fish"" meant there was no ""evidence of irreparable harm"". He noted that sediment measurements offered by plaintiffs were nine months old - which Ledford, who researches urban water quality, said was because the USGS, a federal agency, stopped measuring turbidity in the creek, a proxy for sediment levels, in February.

The agency said the move was prompted by safety concerns surrounding protesters against the project - but in March, within weeks of USGS removing the gauge, DeKalb county closed the public park portion of nearby South River Forest, removing access by activists to what had been ongoing campsites in protest against ""Cop City"".

Police officers have also monitored the construction site on the ground and by helicopter since then, and there have been no incidents that authorities have described as violent or dangerous. Plaintiffs also submitted photos taken more recently to the court, showing sediment entering the creek from a tributary running off the construction site.

""It's an academic conversation and does not rise to the level of empirical evidence this court needs,"" Bloom said. Plaintiffs also included testimony from a handful of scientific and policing experts; defendants had none.

Bloom also referred to the property destruction some of the activists opposing Cop City have engaged in - including the burning of 12 cement trucks the day before, belonging to a local company that had been photographed working on the site. ""We're ... building in a war zone,"" he said.

Jackie Echols, SRWA board president, said afterward: ""I was really just appalled. Given the serious nature of the Clean Water Act, the issues related to water quality - I was surprised at the theatrics.""

Ledford underscored that the case was ""not just about environmental harm, but environmental justice harm"", as neighborhoods surrounding the Cop City site are mostly Black, and the area has a history of industrial pollution.","{'uri': 'theguardian.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","[{'uri': 'timothy_pratt@theguardian.com', 'name': 'Timothy Pratt', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': False}]",https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/12f0209f4e06602d6cfb220bb8ce616e7516cb33/0_93_4320_2592/master/4320.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&s=b41c392af73e9992a0be484dfd25e567,,-0.1607843137254902,25,25,The Guardian,theguardian.com

Please try again later{{ /verifyErrors }}

Rishi Sunak is considering a plan to defy the UK's Human Rights Act as part of his desperate push to get his Rwanda deportation flights off the ground.

It comes as the PM comes under growing pressure from Suella Braverman and the Tory right to flaunt international law by ""disapplying"" the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR).

Mr Sunak is reportedly weighing up some elements of the hardline plan by Ms Braverman - whom he sacked earlier this week - to thwart fresh legal challenges to Rwanda flights.

The Tory leader is considering an emergency bill that would deem Rwanda a ""safe country"" and make clear this overrides the Human Rights Act, according to The Times.

A less contentious option is to try to designate Rwanda a ""safe"" country without any attempt to override human rights law, with the two possibilities said to be part of ""live"" discussions.

Mr Sunak's two-pronged strategy to dealing with the Supreme Court ruling against the government is to announce an emergency law that he says will enable parliament to ""unequivocally"" declare Rwanda a safe destination for asylum seekers.

The PM will also publish an upgraded agreement with the country which is expected to attempt to address the court's concerns around ""refoulement"" - the potential for refugees rejected by Rwanda to be sent back to the country they are fleeing.

But Ms Braverman has demanded Mr Sunak goes further - saying she ""demands of the government an end to self-deception and spin."" She wrote: ""Tinkering with a failed plan will not stop the boats.""

She said any of the UK's domestic or international obligations - the Human Rights Act and the ECHR - need to be made invalid using ""notwithstanding clauses"".

Senior Tory MP Danny Kruger, co-founder of the increasingly influential New Conservatives group, demanded that Mr Sunak ""change course or we will lose the general election"".

Writing in The Telegraph, the leading right-winger warned No 10 that failure to get the Rwanda flights going could lead to a ""formal split"" in the Conservatives and ""splinter"" the party forever.

""We need the Emergency Rwanda Bill to assert supremacy over all the laws and international treaties invoked by the Supreme Court,"" Mr Kruger wrote.

""This is existential. If we get this wrong, our party won't just face rejection at the ballot box, but we risk splintering our coalition forever.""

He said Mr Sunak's response to the Supreme Court ruling ""makes me worry that they are not prepared to cut through the thicket of international and domestic laws and protocols that undermine parliament's sovereignty"".

But Mr Sunak is facing concerns over the dilemma from both sides of his party, with the leading One Nation Tory moderate Damian Green stressing the importance of observing the rule of law.

""It's not just all our own laws passed by parliament, and all international treaties that we have signed, that Suella wants to sweep away,"" Mr Green told BBC Radio 4's Today programme - before comparing Ms Braverman to dictators.

""Conservatives believe in a democratic country run by the rule of law. And dictators, Xi and Putin, would prefer to have the state completely untrammelled by any law. And so, as a democrat I oppose it.""

Immigration minister Robert Jenrick reportedly backs elements of Ms Braverman's Rwanda plan in a ""belt and braces"" push to get the flights to take off.

The Home Office minister had joined Ms Braverman in previously submitting proposals to No 10 which included four of the five points she outlined this week, according to The Telegraph.

On Friday Mr Sunak denied ""tinkering"" with the Rwanda policy after his sacked former home secretary suggested his plan to save the scheme would fail without more radical measures.

Speaking to broadcasters, Mr Sunak insisted he will ""work night and day"" to ensure domestic courts cannot ""systemically"" block flights to the east African nation.

Mr Sunak declined to say whether he would call a general election if the upper chamber blocked the new law - instead insisting it was up to Labour to help it reach the statute books.

Meanwhile, Lord Sumption, a former Supreme Court judge, told the BBC the plan to use a law to declare Rwanda as safe was ""profoundly discreditable"", ""constitutionally really quite extraordinary"", and would ""effectively overrule"" a decision by the UK's highest court.

A government source said the treaty with Rwanda would be published ""shortly"", but perhaps not as soon as Monday, as reports earlier suggested.

The president's 29-year-old granddaughter, Naomi Biden, lives with her husband in Georgetown, a historic waterfront stretch of D.C. packed with trendy bars and restaurants, scenic sidewalks and a handful of foreign embassies.

The incident comes amid a rash of car break-ins in the upscale community, according to neighbors. Signs posted around the tree-lined streets warn drivers not to leave any valuables in their vehicles.

SECRET SERVICE AGENT FIRES GUN AMID CAR BREAK-IN WHILE PROTECTING BIDEN GRANDDAUGHTER

Just steps away from what neighbors identified as her home and the scene of Sunday's shooting, an off-duty officer two years ago thwarted a robbery in progress and engaging in a shootout with the suspects, according to police.

""The officer intervened in an ongoing armed robbery where two suspects, one armed, approaches a vehicle occupied three times with three victims, demanding either the vehicle or cash or other belongings from these individuals,"" DC Police Executive Assistant Chief Ashan Benedict said at the time. ""The officer engages the armed suspect - shots were fired.""

REP. HENRY CUELLAR SPEAKS OUT AFTER CARJACKING: DC 'MORE DANGEROUS' THAN MY BORDER DISTRICT

The Secret Service assisted in arresting one of the suspects in that incident, Benedict said.

It was not immediately clear whether the Secret Service was present on behalf of Biden during that incident - uniformed division officers also patrol near the city's foreign embassies and routinely come to the aid of city police when needed.

""While our primary focus is to ensure the highest levels of safety and security for our protectees and our protected sites, the Secret Service Uniformed Division also has an excellent working relationship with the DC Metropolitan Police Department,"" said Anthony Guglielmi, the Secret Service's chief of communications. ""Our agencies work together every day in various operational capacities and the DC Police Department also supports our protective mission in many ways, and we are grateful for the hand in glove relationship.""

Washington, like many U.S. cities, is struggling to combat rising crime.

Another Georgetown shooting, this one in January 2022, left a 27-year-old man from Alexandria, Virginia, dead in the street, according to FOX 5 DC.

WHITE HOUSE BLOCKS REPORTERS FROM COVERING NAOMI BIDEN WEDDING: 'DEEPLY DISAPPOINTED'

Police statistics show increases in both the thefts of vehicles and of property inside vehicles this year. Even U.S. Rep. Henry Cuellar, D-Texas, fell victim when a group of masked men he described as ""punks with guns"" carjacked him near his Washington apartment building.

In Washington's Second District, which includes Georgetown, more than a thousand additional property crimes have been reported year to date in 2023 compared to 2022. The area has seen 399 stolen vehicles, 1,207 thefts from inside vehicles and nearly 3,000 other types of theft.

""She can choose anywhere she wants to live, and we would just do our best to keep her safe - and our vehicles safe,"" said Thom Bolsch, a former agent who now runs a range in Texas. ""You're running out of good, clean safe areas to live.""

Secret Service agents are bound by the same rules of engagement as other law enforcement officers, Bolsch told Fox News Digital.

""The only reason you're allowed to discharge your weapon is your life, you feel your life is in danger, or someone else is in danger and you want to protect them,"" he told Fox News Digital. ""Maybe they can articulate that. If they just randomly shot at people running away from them, that's not how it's supposed to be done.""

The security team would have had cameras and surveillance in place around the protectee's residents and would be monitoring constantly.

If the agent who opened fire on the would-be thieves feared for his life, or the life of someone else, he would have been justified in the shooting. Authorities have revealed few details, although the Secret Service said in a statement there was no threat to its protectees.

City police said no one was hurt in the incident and three suspects fled in a red car.

Bolsch, who no longer lives in Washington, said Georgetown used to be considered very safe but that crime has been ""creeping"" into nicer neighborhoods in the wake of widespread anti-police protests demanding departments be defended around the country.

""With defund the police, they don't have enough officers,"" Bolsch said. ""Small, petty crimes are what they don't have the ability to enforce, and then when you do arrest somebody they get out by the time you finish the paperwork.""

The decision came down just before 5 p.m. Friday. At issue was whether he was barred from the ballot by a provision of the U.S. Constitution that forbids those who ""engaged in insurrection"" from holding office.

Colorado Secretary of State Jena Griswold released this statement shortly after the ruling, ""The Court determined that Donald Trump is eligible to be placed on the Colorado ballot in the March Presidential Primary. This decision may be appealed. As Secretary of State, I will always ensure that every voter can make their voice heard in free and fair elections.""

Advocates this year have been trying to remove Trump from the ballot in Colorado and other states under Section Three of the 14th Amendment, which bars from office those who swore an oath to uphold the U.S. Constitution and then ""engaged in insurrection"" against it. The measure has only been used a handful of times since the period after the Civil War.

""At the end of the day Colorado voters are going to be able to choose who they want for President and that's what matters,"" said Trump attorney and former secretary of state Scott Gessler.

In her decision, Wallace said she found that Trump did in fact ""engage in insurrection"" on Jan. 6 and rejected his attorneys' arguments that he was simply engaging in free speech. Normally, that would be enough to disqualify him under Section 3, but she said she couldn't do so for a presidential candidate.

""I'm surprised at the way the order was structured. Usually what will happen is courts will decide first whether or not the law applies even before we go forward to a trial. In this instance we have a trail and then she ruled that the law didn't apply,"" said Gessler.

Section 3 does not specifically refer to the presidency, as it does members of the U.S. Senate or House of Representatives. Instead, the clause refers to ""elector of President and Vice President,"" along with civil and military offices.

""Part of the Court's decision is its reluctance to embrace an interpretation which would disqualify a presidential candidate without a clear, unmistakable indication that such is the intent of Section Three,"" the judge wrote.

""It sets up an interesting situation if you think about it,"" said Norm Provizer a professor emeritus of political science at Metropolitan State University of Denver who has taught Constitutional law for decades. ""Was he involved in the insurrection? Yes. Except the President wasn't meant to be covered,"" he summarized.

Gessler was glad to take the victory in court. ""The judge threw a lot of shade on President Trump and you know, we'd rather not have that. At the end of the day though, we won this."" The Trump campaign released a statement saying in part, ""We applaud today's ruling in Colorado, which is another nail in the coffin of the un-American ballot challenges.""

The lawsuit was filed by six republican and unaffiliated voters backed by the left-leaning group Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington.

""This is the first time a presidential candidate has been found to have engaged in insurrection, and it was found after a thorough evidentiary hearing,"" said the organization in a statement.

Plaintiff attorney Mario Nicolais said, ""we are very pleased with the opinion and look forward to addressing the sole legal issue on appeal, namely whether Section 3 of the Fourteenth Amendment applies to insurrectionist presidents.""

They plan to appeal to the Colorado Supreme Court. The case is all but certain to be appealed all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court.

Closing arguments in the lawsuit, which was filed by the left-leaning group Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, wrapped up on Wednesday. Sean Grimsley, an attorney for the petitioners, argued that Trump engaged in an insurrection by inciting a violent mob to attack the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6 to try to stop the peaceful transfer of power. He says that makes him ineligible to hold office under the 14th Amendment. Trump attorney Scott Gessler says there's no evidence that Trump intended to incite violence and violence, he says, doesn't equal an insurrection.

Gessler said the lawsuit amounts to election interference and is based entirely on the Jan. 6 Committee's report which he says is completely one-sided.

""The petitioners are asking this court to do something that's never been done in the history of the United States,"" Gessler said. ""The evidence doesn't come close to allowing the court to do it.""

The trial, which ended two weeks ago, included testimony from D.C. riot police, rallygoers, constitutional experts, and two members of Congress.

The Colorado plaintiffs' attorney, Sean Grimsley, told the judge during Wednesday's hearing that the evidence was clear.

""We are here because, for the first time in our nation's history, the president of the United States engaged in an insurrection,"" he said, summing up their case. ""Now he wants to be president again. The Constitution does not allow that.""

If they can keep Trump off the primary ballot in enough states, advocates hope to keep him from getting the needed delegates to secure the Republican presidential nomination.

Regardless of the judge's decision, the case is all but certain to be appealed all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court.

Similar lawsuits challenging Trump's ballot eligibility under the 14th Amendment have failed recently in Michigan and Minnesota. The Minnesota Supreme Court dodged the question of whether the provision applies to Trump, who is so far dominating the Republican presidential primary. It dismissed a lawsuit to toss him off that state's primary ballot by saying that political parties can allow whomever they want to qualify for primaries. The court left the door open for a general election challenge if Trump becomes the GOP nominee. A Michigan judge dismissed another lawsuit seeking to bounce Trump from that state's primary ballot with a more sweeping ruling. He said whether the provision applies to the former president is a ""political question"" to be settled by Congress, not judges. The liberal group that filed the Michigan case, Free Speech For People, said it plans to appeal the decision.

The Trump campaign has called the lawsuits ""election interference"" and an ""anti-democratic"" attempt to stop voters from having the choice they want next November.","{'uri': 'cbsnews.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'CBS News'}",[],https://assets1.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2023/11/16/e8fe01fc-c63d-414d-9d9b-fd16f2d84e4a/thumbnail/1200x630/9fc2cd33a98ac9c0fa94927dd69d1513/l-trump-ballot-trial-5vo-frame-874.jpg?v=5659e73acd91751548aa89950cf015b0,eng-9068426,0.1372549019607843,25,25,CBS News,cbsnews.com

City is back at ‘centre of the international stage’ but must enact its own security law to complement the one implemented by Beijing in 2020, he says

Hongkongers must stay vigilant to guard against people with “ulterior motives” and foreign forces trying to “sow discord” or bring back social unrest, the city’s leader has warned, underscoring that stability is needed to attract investment.

Chief Executive John Lee Ka-chiu on Saturday told the 2023 Fight Crime Conference that violence seen during the months-long protests in 2019 could return at any time and the city must enact its own national security law by next year.

“I have a profound feeling, when interacting with guests from all over the world at different events, that Hong Kong must have a stable environment if it is to attract global investors,” Lee said at the first edition of the conference after a five-year hiatus following the protests and Covid-19.

“We should therefore stay vigilant at all times,” he said, warning against the presence of “soft resistance”.

“Everyone who loves Hong Kong should take national security as the starting point in staying alert and guarding against those with ulterior motives or foreign forces who try to sow discord in the city,” he said. “We should object and refute any smear campaigns with ill intention [against Hong Kong].”

Lee said the national security law imposed by Beijing in the wake of the protests had achieved immediate results in ending the chaos, declaring Hong Kong was back to the “centre of the international stage” with its rebound in tourist numbers and return of mega events.Finance chief will tell ‘true stories’ about Hong Kong at Apec summit: John Lee

He also stressed the city needed to complete the legislation of its own national security legislation, as stipulated in Article 23 of the Basic Law, the city’s mini-constitution, by next year to complement the Beijing-decreed law. The goal was spelled out in Lee’s policy address last month.

Speaking at a sharing session with the leaders and members of various district crime-fighting committees, Secretary for Justice Paul Lam Ting-kwok said it was necessary to change the attitude of some residents towards the Beijing-imposed law, which he said was every time it was mentioned.

He likened the security legislation to a vaccine which protected residents against disease.Hong Kong’s John Lee ‘strongly’ condemns US bill to sanction 49 local officials

“Behaviours that endanger national security are like the viruses and bacteria that we see everywhere, [and] the goal of the national security law is like a vaccine injection,” he said. “Our intent is not to hurt you, we just do not want you to fall sick or die.”

Lam emphasised that the national security law was “defensive” and not “offensive”.

“We are not targeting residents, we are targeting the external elements who are hurting the healthy survival of our society,” he said.

The conference on Saturday was organised by the Fight Crime Committee to provide a platform for its members, and those from the 18 district crime-fighting bodies, to exchange views on law and order. The high-level event was also attended by No 2 official Eric Chan Kwok-ki and security minister Chris Tang Ping-keung.","{'uri': 'scmp.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'South China Morning Post'}",[],https://cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/d8/images/canvas/2023/11/18/0588ce1c-a4a3-4cd4-8bb8-f4c9b89ea806_428f0091.jpg?itok=765J2WB8,,-0.0980392156862745,25,25,South China Morning Post,scmp.com

Elise Stefanik is seen during a press conference at the U.S. Capitol on Nov. 14, 2023.Francis Chung / Politico via AP

Rep. Elise Stefanik, a member of House GOP leadership, has filed new documents to her judicial ethics complaint from last week against the judge overseeing former President Donald Trump's civil fraud trial in New York.

In a letter Friday, the New York lawmaker added to her complaint by attaching the mistrial motion filed by Trump's attorneys accusing Judge Arthur Engoron of bias. The judge dismissed the mistrial bid on Friday afternoon.

The 30-page motion filed by Trump on Wednesday was ""wrongly denied"" by Engoron, Stefanik said in Friday's letter. Her original complaint accused the judge of exhibiting ""clear judicial bias"" against the former president, and called on him to recuse himself.

The complaint argued that Engoron had illegally infringed on Trump's protected political speech and that he violated political contribution rules by making donations to Democrats as recently as 2018.

In a statement to NBC News, Stefanik said on Friday that the mistrial motion adds ""examples of even more of his egregious misconduct"" by Engoron to the complaint filed with the New York State Commission on Judicial Conduct.

""A week ago, I filed an ethics complaint against Manhattan Judge Arthur Engoron for his partisan antics, bias, and railroading of President Trump,"" Stefanik said. ""After my complaint, a New York appellate court smacked down Judge Engoron for his blatantly unconstitutional gag order. Today, I'm supplementing my ethics complaint against Judge Engoron with examples of even more of his egregious misconduct after he just wrongly dismissed President Trump's motion for a mistrial.""

In shooting down Trump's bid for a mistrial, Engoron called the former president's arguments ""utterly without merit.""

Engoron is presiding over a bench trial in the $250 million lawsuit, meaning he will issue a verdict and determine any resulting penalties. The case stems from a lawsuit filed by New York Attorney General Letitia James last year that accuses Trump of inflating asset values for financial gain. He has denied wrongdoing.","{'uri': 'nbcnews.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'NBC News'}",[],"https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_nbcnews-fp-1024-512,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2023-11/231117-rep-elise-stefanik-wm-457p-edf456.jpg",eng-9072064,-0.3647058823529412,25,25,NBC News,nbcnews.com

An appeal is expected and could ultimately be resolved by the Colorado Supreme Court or the U.S. Supreme Court. Wallace's ruling came a week and a half after the Minnesota Supreme Court ruled Trump could not be removed from the primary ballot in that state and three days after a Michigan judge reached the same conclusion.

Despite the decision's blunt wording and findings, Trump campaign spokesman Steve Cheung championed the ruling, calling it ""another nail in the coffin of the un-American ballot challenges.""

Trump opponents have been bringing their lawsuits state by state in hopes of ultimately securing a U.S. Supreme Court ruling that keeps the leading Republican candidate off the ballot in all states. The cases are moving quickly because caucuses and primaries will be held starting in January.

Adopted in 1868, three years after the end of the Civil War, the 14th Amendment granted citizenship to those born or naturalized in the United States and guaranteed civil rights to all Americans, including those who had been enslaved. The amendment's lesser-known Section 3 was aimed at limiting the power of former Confederates by barring from office those who had sworn an oath to the Constitution and later engaged in insurrection.

Although Wallace found that Trump engaged in insurrection, she determined Section 3 does not apply to him. Section 3 refers to some offices and refers to those who are an ""officer of the United States,"" but does not specifically mention the presidency.

The Allegheny County Health Department ordered the Kuhn's on Banksville Road to close for an imminent hazard after an inspection on Friday. A sign posted on the store Friday night read, ""The store is temporarily closed due to a drain issue and no running water.""

The inspector said there was an active sewage backup in ""critical"" parts of the store like the kitchen and food storage area. The report says the inspector saw employees ""engaging in business as usual during an emergent situation.""

The inspector could tell the sewage was improperly cleaned because there was a lack of residual chlorine in stagnant water around those areas, the report says, and there was evidence of prior backups in customer areas of the deli section.

No one in charge notified the Health Department of an emergency situation, which the inspection report says is a repeat violation.

The grocery store's health permit also expired on Oct. 31.

Before reopening, the health permit needs to be renewed and a plumber needs to diagnose plumbing issues with video evidence.

A Colorado judge has turned away a challenge looking to disqualify former President Donald Trump from running for president under an interpretation of the 14th Amendment that argued he engaged in insurrection against the United States on Jan. 6, 2021.

The ruling came in a case brought by progressive activists who sued the state, arguing that Trump was barred from returning to the office. A handful of courts in other states turned away similar challenges.

The case in Colorado was brought by the liberal government watchdog group Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington. CREW argued that Trump is ineligible to run because of a clause in the 14th Amendment, which reads that those who took an oath to defend the Constitution and then have ""engaged in insurrection or rebellion against the same, or given aid or comfort to the enemies thereof"" are ineligible to serve.","{'uri': 'politico.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'POLITICO'}",[],https://static.politico.com/81/fc/94c68ccf4c9f97de2473ee6ce1c4/https-delivery-gettyimages.com/downloads/1776471064,eng-9068426,-0.01960784313725494,25,25,POLITICO,politico.com

A Colorado judge on Friday rejected a 14th Amendment challenge to Donald Trump being on the state's presidential ballot next year.

The ruling follows a trial over Trump's eligibility under the Amendment's insurrection clause. The Colorado case is one of several legal challenges pending across the country in which voters have cited the constitutional amendment to try and keep the former president off the presidential ballot in 2024.

Courts in Minnesota and Michigan recently punted on the 14th Amendment question. The Minnesota Supreme Court said it's up to state Republicans to determine whether to put Trump on the primary ballot and that the question of general election eligibility is premature. A Michigan judge issued a similar ruling but went further in deeming the constitutional question a ""political"" one that's for Congress, not courts, to decide. It doesn't appear that the Minnesota ruling is being appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court, but the Michigan challengers have vowed to appeal the lower court ruling at least through the state judicial system.

The U.S. Supreme Court will likely have the final word on the subject, though it's not yet clear in which case -- or cases.

Wallace issued a ruling in the Trump ballot eligibility case, ordering the Colorado secretary of state to place Trump on the state's primary ballot for next year.

The ruling is another victory for Trump after courts in Minnesota and Michigan this month rejected similar legal efforts to disqualify the him from running for president in those states.

A group of Colorado voters filed a legal challenge to Trump's candidacy in September, arguing that his efforts to overturn the 2020 election results and his and conduct surrounding the Jan. 6, 2021, Capitol riot violated Section 3 of the 14th Amendment to the Constitution, making him ineligible for office.

The lawsuit alleged Trump ""engaged in insurrection or rebellion"" after having sworn an oath to support and defend the Constitution and asked the court to declare that Trump is constitutionally ineligible to appear on any Colorado ballot for state or federal office and to prohibit Secretary of State Jena Griswold from allowing his name to appear on any future primary or general election ballots in the state.

Wallace began hearing arguments in the case last month, with closing arguments in the trial taking place Wednesday.

""Through his actions, and his actions alone, Donald Trump has disqualified himself from ever holding office again,"" attorney Sean Grimsley said in a closing argument on behalf of the petitioners.

The former president is facing a string of efforts in other states to keep him off the ballot in 2024 on similar grounds. The Minnesota Supreme Court ruled last week that state law did not bar a major political party from placing a candidate who is ineligible for office on the presidential nomination primary ballot, and a Michigan judge denied a similar effort on Tuesday, finding that the secretary of state lacked the authority to intervene.

In his closing argument, Trump attorney Scott Gessler highlighted those cases, asserting that there is ""an emerging consensus here within the judiciary across the United States.""

Former President Donald Trump's name will remain on the Colorado 2024 presidential primary ballot, a judge ruled Friday.

The decision came following a legal challenge seeking to disqualify Trump from appearing on the ballot, citing the 14th Amendment.

The lawsuit sought to use the Disqualifications Clause, or Section 3 of the 14th Amendment, which bars individuals who have ""engaged in insurrection or rebellion"" against America or who have aided those engaged in such activities from holding office, and specifically cited Trump's alleged involvement in the Capitol riot of Jan. 6, 2021.

Watchdog group Citizens for Responsibility and six Colorado voters filed the lawsuit in September, one of multiple legal attempts in a number of states across the country aiming to prevent Trump winning another four years in the White House.

The decision comes after a Michigan judge ruled Wednesday in a similar lawsuit that Trump would also remain on that state's primary ballot, which followed the Minnesota Supreme Court and a federal judge in New Hampshire previously dismissing other challenges.

The New York state judge presiding over Donald Trump's $250 million New York civil fraud case knocked down his bid for a mistrial on Friday, calling the former president's arguments ""utterly without merit.""

In a brief and blunt ruling, Judge Arthur Engoron said he was refusing to even allow arguments on the mistrial motion because the premises of the motion were flawed and it would be ""futile."" The judge described Trump's rationale for halting the trial, now in its second month, as ""disingenuous,"" made in ""bad faith"" and ""nonsensical.""

Trump's attorneys filed the mistrial motion Wednesday, arguing that Engoron and his law clerk had demonstrated bias against the former president. They also accused the clerk, who sits alongside the judge in the courtroom, of improperly acting as a ""co-judge"" in the case.

The clerk's ""position as a de facto co-judge"" violates the judicial code and ""creates the appearance, if not the fact, of a co-judge presiding over the trial,"" they wrote.

Engoron, who last week issued a gag order barring Trump's lawyers from disparaging the clerk after having previously fined Trump for comments about her, denied the allegations from Trump's attorneys, as he'd previously done in court.

He said he has the ""absolute unfettered right"" to consult with his clerk however much he wants, and ""as I have made clear over the course of this trial, my rulings are mine and mine alone. There is no 'co-judging' at play.""

The judge also disputed the allegation from Trump's attorneys that his clerk had made political donations to Democrats that exceeded the legal limits. Engoron said the lawyers had their facts and math wrong, adding that the clerk's financial contributions ""were well below the ethical and legal permissible annual limit"" and that the attorneys had not taken into account that his clerk had been running for a judgeship herself.

He also called the arguments about her being biased ""nonsensical"" and a ""red herring"" since the clerk ""does not make rulings or issue orders -- I do.""

In response to assertions that he was biased when he said during Trump's testimony that he was not there to hear what the former president ""had to say,"" Engoron called those accusations ""disingenuous"" and a ""bad faith"" argument. The judge noted the lawyers ""omitted what I said immediately after that sentence, which is 'I'm here to hear him answer questions.' Indeed, those are precisely the roles of the witness and the finder of fact.""

Trump's lawyers had also charged that the judge has ruled against them much more than he'd ruled against New York Attorney General Letitia James' office, who brought the fraud claims against Trump and his company. Engoron called that argument ""similarly without merit.""

""I stand by each and every ruling, and they speak for themselves,"" he said on Friday.

Trump attorney Alina Habba said she was not surprised by the ruling.

""As expected, today the Court refused to take responsibility for its failure to preside over this case in an impartial and unbiased manner. We, however, remain undeterred and will continue to fight for our clients' right to a fair trial,"" she said in a statement.

On Thursday, Trump's lawyers filed an appeal of Engoron's gag order barring them and their client from complaining about the clerk. The judge had said he was concerned the focus on the clerk could jeopardize her safety and the safety of his staff. A state appeals court judge temporarily lifted Engoron's gag order after Trump's attorneys alleged his First Amendment rights were being violated.

The temporary pause is expected to remain in place until a full panel of state Appellate Division judges considers the appeal later this month.","{'uri': 'nbcnews.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'NBC News'}",[],"https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_nbcnews-fp-1024-512,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2023-11/231115-donald-trump-court-ew-107p-9ca76e.jpg",eng-9072064,-0.3411764705882353,25,25,NBC News,nbcnews.com

The teenager was behind the wheel of a white 2023 Volkswagen Taos that had been reported stolen out of Montgomery County, Maryland, police said.

He and his passenger, 20-year-old Nicholas Battle of Glen Burnie, attracted the attention of detectives assigned to Anne Arundel County's Criminal Investigation Division Auto Theft Task Force as they were traveling through Glen Burnie.

The task force members were patrolling the area near the University of Maryland Baltimore Washington Medical Center as part of an initiative to curtail incidences of motor vehicle theft in Anne Arundel County, according to authorities.

That's when they noticed the stolen Volkswagen Taos, police said.

The task force members allegedly tried and failed to conduct a traffic stop on the vehicle when it was near the intersection of Elvaton Road and Tall Pines Court, according to authorities.

The teenage driver ""accelerated quickly in reverse toward the detective's police vehicle,"" ramming it, police said.

The teen drove off and was pursued by other officers until he stopped the vehicle. After that, both he and Battle attempted to run away from the officers, according to authorities.

Task force members were finally able to apprehend them in the 1000 block of Upton Road, police said.

The teen driver was found to be in possession of a key fob for the stolen Volkswagen Taos and Battle was found to be in possession of a key fob for a stolen 2019 Nissan Altima, according to authorities.

Officers found the Nissan Altima on Tall Pines Court.

The teenager and Battle now face charges in connection with motor vehicle theft and assault on a police officer, according to authorities.","{'uri': 'cbsnews.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'CBS News'}",[],https://assets1.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2021/07/14/b3cfee9f-8c43-4fb9-ac5b-ee3893869f8d/thumbnail/1200x630/625c354b2826d0644488435e60f7c4f4/snapshot-2021-07-14T173315.572.jpg?v=5659e73acd91751548aa89950cf015b0,eng-9073436,-0.3960784313725491,25,25,CBS News,cbsnews.com

But Democrats said the move was made to help out with the governor's political ambitions by shielding his travel from public scrutiny.

The media organization first sued the Florida Department of Law Enforcement, the agency which keeps DeSantis' travel records, over the summer after it rebuffed the Post over four separate public records requests. Florida Circuit Judge Angela Dempsey ordered FDLE to turn over all ""nonexempt public records"" following a September court hearing, but the agency said certain records were exempt due to the new law.

In late October, lawyers for the Post filed a 25-page motion asking that Dempsey order the law-enforcement agency to hand over additional records, asserting that the travel records exemption was overly broad and unconstitutional. Florida voters in 1992 passed a ""Sunshine amendment"" that guarantees the public's access to government records and open meetings.

""The exemption sweeps from public view every record relating in any way to the expenditure of millions of taxpayer dollars each year, including the most basic information needed to inform the public about what those services are for, when they were provide, who received them and why,"" states the motion filed by the Post's lawyers. ""The Florida Constitution prohibits such a gaping disconnect between the narrow justification for an exemption and its sweeping coverage.""

Dempsey, who earlier this year sided with lawyers from the DeSantis administration and ruled that the governor can withhold records under a never-before-applied doctrine of ""executive privilege,"" is scheduled to consider the Post's motion at a January hearing.

A Post spokesperson said the company does not comment on pending litigation. POLITICO is using the same law firm representing The Post -- Ballard Spahr -- to raise questions about FDLE's ongoing delay to comply with public record requests made by POLITICO.

DeSantis' travels, including his use of state jets acquired after he became governor as well his reliance on private planes either chartered or owned by GOP donors, have come under scrutiny, especially after he began his campaign for president.

POLITICO previously raised questions about flights he took during a book promotional tour shortly before he officially began his campaign. The Washington Post reported in September about undisclosed flights DeSantis took between his election in 2018 and his inauguration while POLITICO reported last month that Florida's former economic development agency paid nearly $1.6 million for an international trade mission. The bulk of the money was spent on two chartered jets that took the governor, along with first lady Casey DeSantis and other state officials and business leaders, to stops in Japan, South Korea, Israel and England.

The Post states that in April of this year -- which was before the new law took effect -- the news organization asked FDLE for all records related to DeSantis' plane travel dating back to January 2019. After the initial court order demanding the state turn over some records, the Post's legal filing states FDLE discussed what it would turn over and provided examples of travel records in its possession, including memorandums concerning reimbursements paid to DeSantis' reelection campaign for use of the state plane.

But FDLE did not hand over all those records and instead gave the Post copies of annual FDLE reports that track overall spending by the agency on security and transportation costs. In the court filing, the Post attorneys maintained the agency decided to ""renege on the parties deal.""

The Post's legal challenge also maintains FDLE has not turned over all records related to a request to look at FDLE emails regarding the Tampa Convention Center, which was the site of DeSantis' 2022 election night party. The Post was seeking emails related to efforts to ban concealed weapons from the Convention Center.","{'uri': 'politico.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'POLITICO'}",[],https://static.politico.com/c4/ca/af367e6c46cb92e6b029e08cfffe/https-delivery-gettyimages.com/downloads/1774781457,,0.3333333333333333,25,25,POLITICO,politico.com

Six more law enforcement officers have been charged with failing to intervene during the fatal shooting of Christian Glass, who called 911 while experiencing a mental health crisis in Clear Creek County, Colorado, in 2022, the district attorney's office said Friday.

Randy Williams, a Georgetown marshal; Georgetown police Officer Timothy Collins, who was at the time a deputy in Clear Creek County; Colorado State Patrol trooper Ryan Bennie; Idaho Springs police Officer Brittany Morrow; and two Colorado Gaming Commission officers, Christa Lloyd and Mary Harris, were all criminally charged with misdemeanors.

On Thursday, former Clear Creek County Deputy Kyle Gould pleaded guilty on charges of failing to intervene. Gould, the supervisor of Andrew Buen, the former Clear Creek County deputy who fatally shot Glass, was not on the scene, but provided direction while watching live bodycam recording.

During the encounter, according to body camera footage, Gould called for officers to break into the SUV that Glass was driving. A Clear Creek County District judge sentenced Gould to two years of unsupervised probation and issued him a $1,000 fine; Gould is not allowed to work in law enforcement or security.

Buen pleaded not guilty to charges of second-degree murder, official misconduct and reckless endangerment earlier this month.

Last year, HuffPost found that Buen was being sued for excessive force over a 2019 incident where he allegedly choked a man and kneeled on his back. The Clear Creek County Sheriff's Office settled the case for $15,000 in February.

On June 11, 2022, Glass, who was 22, called 911 and said his vehicle was stuck.

""I'm in a vehicle and my vehicle got stuck, in a really bad way,"" Glass said on the call. ""I have a weapon on me. I will throw them out of the window as soon as an officer gets here.""

The 911 operator who contacted officers described Glass as ""very paranoid."" Seven officers from five departments arrived on the scene, and recordings from the scene indicate that officers talked about a potential ""psych issue.""

Glass told officers he was ""terrified"" when they arrived.

Buen eventually fired at least five shots at Glass, who did not leave his vehicle at any point. Bodycam footage shows that none of the other officers intervened.

The county sheriff's department argued that Buen fired shots at Glass because he would not drop a knife after being told to do so.

Glass' family reached a $19 million settlement, one of the largest payouts related to an individual killed by police in Colorado.

In a statement on Friday, Col. Matthew Packard, chief of the Colorado State Patrol, said he had reviewed the bodycam footage and felt that Bennie, in particular, had not violated policy. He acknowledged that Glass should be alive, and described his death as a tragedy.

""In my review, I found no indication that Trooper Bennie violated any Colorado State Patrol policy or training. I am shocked by the decision of the District Attorney to pursue charges against Trooper Bennie,"" Packard said in the statement. ""While the outcome of this case is pending, Trooper Bennie will be reassigned to an administrative position.""","{'uri': 'huffpost.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'HuffPost'}",[],https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/6557d054230000df71ea602a.jpeg?ops=1200_630,eng-9069006,-0.2627450980392156,25,25,HuffPost,huffpost.com

A unanimous three-judge panel of the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals said that because deportation proceedings are civil and not criminal, non-citizens are not entitled to Miranda warnings typically recited by police during a criminal arrest regardless of whether a warrant is involved.

The court upheld an order to deport Jose Maria Zuniga De La Cruz, a Mexican citizen who had sought to block the fact that he had admitted to immigration officers that he was in the United States illegally from being used as evidence in his case.

The U.S. Department of Justice and a lawyer for Zuniga did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

The 1966 U.S. Supreme Court decision in Miranda v. Arizona says prosecutors cannot use criminal defendants' statements against them unless they were first informed of their constitutional rights to counsel and against self-incrimination.

At least seven appeals courts, including the 9th Circuit, have ruled that Miranda does not apply to civil immigration proceedings.

Zuniga, who had been in the United States since 2004, was arrested outside of his home in 2018 by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officers who had obtained an administrative warrant. The officers said Zuniga admitted that he was in the U.S. illegally.

Unlike criminal arrest warrants, which must be signed by a judge, administrative warrants are approved by an ICE official based on evidence that a person is illegally present in the country.

Zuniga said the statements he made to the officers were coerced and he moved to suppress them, claiming that Miranda applied to his case. He argued that an arrest backed by an administrative warrant is ""closer to a criminal arrest,"" according to Friday's decision.

An immigration judge denied the motion and ordered Zuniga to be deported, and the U.S. Board of Immigration Appeals affirmed. The 9th Circuit on Friday rejected Zuniga's appeal.

""It is the nature of the proceeding in which the inculpatory statements are to be used and not the nature of the arrest that is relevant,"" Circuit Judge Daniel Bress wrote.

Circuit Judge Salvador Mendoza in a concurring opinion agreed that Miranda did not apply to civil proceedings. But non-citizens have constitutional rights, he wrote, and the 9th Circuit should consider adopting a similar requirement for deportation cases.

""Though Mr. Zuniga's Miranda argument fails, it raises important questions: when should immigration officers advise noncitizens of their rights, and what exactly should this prophylactic warning look like?"" wrote Mendoza, an appointee of President Joe Biden.

Bress, who was appointed by Republican former President Donald Trump, in response to Mendoza said there was no legal basis to grant those rights.

""Miranda, which does not apply here, is not authority for creating new versions of itself in the immigration context,"" he wrote.

The panel also included U.S. District Judge Joan Ericksen of the District of Minnesota, who sat by designation.

The case is Zuniga De La Cruz v. Garland, 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, No. 21-352.

Fenton, located in Jefferson Davis Parish, has just one main road, one library, one gas station, one town hall.

In June 2022, a staggering $1.3 million was generated through fines and forfeitures, just as much revenue as Shreveport, which has a population of 187,000.

The teeny village collected its revenue primarily traffic tickets, more than almost any other municipality in Louisiana in a single year, audits revealed, ProPublica reported.

Those who have a gripe with their ticket or fines must appeal to Fenton town's mayor, Mayor Eddie Alfred, Jr., who appears to serve a dual role.

He is responsible for the town's finances and also is the town's judge. As the judge, he appoints the prosecutors, and if drivers request a trial, he decides if they are guilty or innocent.

The fines were collected through the 'mayor's court'. Its purpose is to process the thousands of speeding tickets that were written up yearly by officers from the Fenton police department.

The town of Fenton, located in Jefferson Davis Parish in Louisian, is compromised of approximately twenty blocks. The one-mile stretch of highway is located between central Louisiana and east Texas along U.S. Route 165

The revenue collected reportedly contributes to part of the salaries of the mayor, the clerk, and others, the news outlet revealed.

The village located in Jefferson Davis Parish is compromised of approximately twenty blocks. The tiny town has a city hall, a gas station, a church, a library, a dollar store, and some public housing units.

Those who drive along the one-mile stretch of highway - located between central Louisiana and east Texas along US Route 165 - are either town residents or those heading to east Texas from central Louisiana.

Mike Holmes, Fenton's village attorney told WVUE-TV and ProPublica in an email that the mayor presides over court in a 'neutral, impartial manner' consistent with Louisiana law.

He also claimed that tickets are only dismissed at his discretion.

However, the village's court records show a different story on how some tickets are handled, and revealed the challenges they faced trying to get answers.

The teeny village collected its revenue primarily traffic tickets, more than almost any other municipality in Louisiana in a single year

Journalists from WVUE and ProPublica who were trying to find out exactly how the court in Fenton operates visited the town four different times. During those visits, they reviewed court files, town meeting minutes, municipal ordinances and body camera video.

They also requested electronic case summaries over a three-and-a-half year period. Though they tried to see the court in action, they reported that they were only able to witness court one time. They also noted that they were only got to speak with the mayor for five minutes.

Many officials offered conflicting explanations for the mayor's role, how and why tickets are reduced or dismissed, why the town asks the state to suspend so many drivers' licenses and how often trials are held.

Their description of how the town runs its court didn't align with state Judicial College guidance or that U.S. Supreme Court ruling.

Joel Friedman, an emeritus professor at Tulane University in New Orleans who has taught procedural law for 46 years, told ProPublica: 'There's no accountability. They can do whatever they want.'

'The mayor who's trying to raise money for the city is in charge of prosecuting these minor criminal offenses and getting fines brought back to the city,' he added.

Another attorney, who wrote a book about the matter, agreed with Friedman and told the news outlet that Fenton shouldn't allow the mayor to preside over court.","{'uri': 'dailymail.co.uk', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'Daily Mail Online'}",[],https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2023/11/17/20/77940951-0-The_town_of_Fenton_located_in_Jefferson_Davis_Parish_that_is_com-a-32_1700251575335.jpg,,-0.003921568627450966,25,25,Daily Mail Online,dailymail.co.uk

Zhenyu Wang, 42, and Daniel Ray Lane, 42, were found guilty on Wednesday, and each face a maximum penalty of 45 years in prison. The two men had planned to purchase petroleum from Iran, mask its origins, and then sell it to a refinery in China, the department said in a statement.

Lane was president of privately held Stack Royalties, a Texas-based company that sells oil and gas mineral rights to investment funds and private equity groups.

Lane's attorney, Paul Hetznecker, told Reuters in a statement that the case was based on undercover government agents who offered Lane ""millions of dollars in profits"" if he took part in the scheme, after initially rebuffing their approaches.

""This is an outrageous example of government overreach,"" Hetznecker said in a statement. He vowed to appeal the conviction.

An attorney for Wang did not respond to a request for comment.

The pair were charged, along with three others, in 2020 in U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania. Two co-conspirators have since pleaded guilty, court records showed.

""The Justice Department will not tolerate those who would violate U.S. sanctions and imperil our national security for personal profit,"" said Matt Olsen, head of the Justice Department's National Security Division, in a statement.

The officers fired three dozen shots, officials said during a press conference Friday afternoon at Baltimore police headquarters where they played the recordings and presented the department´s view of them.

The shooting occurred Nov. 7, when officers on a District Action Team - a squad focused on seizing illegal guns - were proactively patrolling in southwest Baltimore. A man later identified as Hunter Jessup, 27, was killed during a short foot pursuit. The videos show him appear to fire his own weapon before he´s struck by gunfire and falls to the sidewalk.

Officials said they haven´t determined how many times Jessup was shot.

In the aftermath of the shooting, some community members questioned whether his death was necessary. They said officers on the department´s specialized gun squads have a reputation for displaying overly aggressive behavior and escalating otherwise peaceful encounters, especially in that neighborhood.

But Baltimore Police Commissioner Richard Worley has commended the officers´ actions, saying they protected public safety in an area plagued by violence. He also said they yelled at Jessup multiple times to drop his weapon before opening fire.

(Jerry Jackson/The Baltimore Sun via AP)

""While it´s an unfortunate incident, the investigation is still going on,"" he said, adding that officers will continue patrolling the area ""to provide greater visibility and better response times with the goal of deterring and preventing violent crime.""

Worley said police are trained to ""shoot to incapacitate"" whenever they encounter someone they consider ""a threat of deadly violence,"" which often means continuing to shoot until the threat has passed. In this case, the officers fired 36 shots at Jessup, Worley said.

The entire interaction lasted less than a minute.

The videos show police in two vehicles talking with two men standing on a corner. The men lift their shirts in response to a request from the officers, who saw a ""bulge"" in Jessup´s clothing, officials said. Off-camera, he takes off running. Officers pursue him on foot and by car, converging on a sidewalk around the corner.

One officer jumps out of a vehicle and tries to tackle Jessup, despite the gun in his right hand, but he slips away. Others point their weapons at him, repeatedly yelling at him to ""get on the ground"" and ""drop the gun."" Jessup keeps running and turns toward another officer as all four open fire.

During Friday´s news conference, officials pointed to a slowed-down version of the video that appears to show a bullet from Jessup´s gun striking a parked car. Officials said they´re still processing evidence to determine how many shots Jessup fired.

Worley said Jessup´s family members viewed the recordings from the four officers´ body cameras before it was made public.

A woman who answered the phone at a number listed for Jessup´s possible relative said she had no comment before hanging up.

Police said Jessup was under correctional supervision in a case from a different jurisdiction. They didn´t provide additional details about the case.

The Maryland Attorney General´s Office is investigating. Under a state law change that went into effect Oct. 1, the statewide office will decide whether to bring criminal charges against any of the officers involved. Previously, that decision fell to local prosecutors.

Baltimore´s DAT squads have been scrutinized, particularly after another police shooting unfolded under similar circumstances this year, leaving a teen in critical condition less than a mile from where Jessup was shot. Police tried to stop the teenager because they believed he was armed, and an officer shot him from behind as he ran away holding a gun in one hand.

Department leaders created the DAT squads after the Gun Trace Task Force was disbanded amid federal racketeering charges accusing several officers of systematically robbing the city and its residents using illegal searches and planted evidence. The corruption scandal helped prompt widespread reform efforts within the department, which has a long history of problematic interactions with the city´s Black community.

As to his clerk, Allison Greenfield, who has been the target of Trump and his lawyers since the start of the trial, Engoron also dismissed Trump's lawyers' concerns. Citing an article in conservative media, Trump's lawyers alleged that Greenfield had violated a court ethics rule by giving Democratic causes more than $500 in political donations per year.

Engoron acknowledged that clerks are prohibited from exceeding $500 in annual political donations, but he said Greenfield is governed by a different guideline because she is a candidate for a New York judgeship. Engoron cited a guideline that says the $500 limitation doesn't apply to a candidate's contributions to her own campaign and doesn't limit ticket purchases to political functions.

""When deducting the price of tickets to political functions that my Principal Law Clerk attended from all the contributions to which the defendants cite, the remainder is still well below the ethical and legal permissible annual limit,"" Engoron wrote.

Earlier this month, Trump's lawyers' complaints about Greenfield prompted the judge to issue a gag order preventing the lawyers involved in the trial from ""from making any public statements, in or out of court, that refer to any confidential communications, in any form, between my staff and me.""

His lawyers had complained about Greenfield's conduct on the bench -- she sits next to Engoron and often consults with him or passes him notes -- and had raised concerns about bias based on a Breitbart article about her political donations.

That gag order was the second of two the judge has issued. The first was also prompted by comments about Greenfield in the form of a social media post by Trump. Both gag orders were paused Thursday by an appeals court judge.

In his ruling Friday, Engoron also sought again -- as he has repeatedly during the trial -- to emphasize both his right to consult with his clerk and his independence.

""[A]s I have made clear over the course of this trial, my rulings are mine, and mine alone. There is absolutely no 'co-judging' at play,"" he wrote.

The 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals granted FirstEnergy's petition for interlocutory review on Thursday, signaling that the appellate court wants to be sure U.S. District Judge Algenon Marbley of Columbus, Ohio, properly certified a class of FirstEnergy shareholders and noteholders to pursue fraud claims stemming from a years-long political bribery scheme.

FirstEnergy (FE.N)agreed in 2021 to pay $230 million to resolve U.S. government charges that it paid tens of millions of dollars to Ohio state lawmakers in a push for a law to bail out two aging nuclear plants. Investors claim that the company is liable for the losses they allegedly suffered when a leading Ohio politician was arrested, and the bribery scheme came to light.

The appeal of Marbley's class certification decision, as I told you when FirstEnergy's appellate lawyers at Sullivan & Cromwell petitioned for 6th Circuit review last April, will address two hot-button issues in securities class actions.

The first is whether securities class actions alleging both fraudulent omissions and affirmative misrepresentations can be certified under the lenient Affiliate Ute test, which does not require investors to prove that they relied on deceptive omission, or the more stringent Basic test for fraudulent misrepresentations. As you know, U.S. Supreme Court precedent allows securities class action defendants to assert a variety of arguments to rebut the presumption, under the Basic test, that their alleged misstatements impacted the market for their stock and bonds.

Marbley certified the FirstEnergy class under the Affiliated Ute standard, reasoning that investors' claims ""primarily"" stemmed from FirstEnergy's failure to disclose the bribery scheme. The judge also said that he would have certified the class under the Basic standard, as lead shareholder counsel from Robbins Geller Rudman & Dowd pointed out in a brief opposing FirstEnergy's petition for review of the class certification order.

FirstEnergy nevertheless argued that the appeals court should step in to clarify that Affiliated Ute does not apply in cases asserting a mix of omissions and misrepresentations. In a brief responding to shareholders, the company asserted that seven other circuit courts have already rejected shareholder attempts to use the Affiliated Ute test to certify classes alleging ""half-truths.""

FirstEnergy's argument was amplified in friend-of-the-court briefs from several law professors and from two business groups, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association (SIFMA). The company's backers warned the 6th Circuit that Marbley's reliance on the Affiliated Ute test in a case alleging a mix of omissions and misrepresentations was an improper expansion of the more lenient standard.

Unless the appeals court clamps down, argued SIFMA and the Chamber, the 6th Circuit will become an outlier where investors get what amounts to a free pass to class certification.

""Absent the guardrails established by Basic and its progeny, public companies would be exposed to near automatic class certification, as plaintiffs will invoke the less demanding Affiliated Ute presumption in nearly every case,"" the law professors predicted in their brief.

The second issue raised in the interlocutory appeal is a bit more esoteric. The Supreme Court held in 2013's Comcast Corporation v. Behrend that classes cannot be certified unless plaintiffs' lawyers have offered a classwide model for calculating damages. In FirstEnergy, Robbins Geller provided expert witnesses who opined on calculating damages for noteholders asserting claims under the Securities Act and shareholders alleging Exchange Act violations.

But the company argued that Marbley fell short of Comcast's ""rigorous analysis"" requirement when he signed off on the proposed classwide damages model for investors' Exchange Act claims. According to FirstEnergy, the trial judge erroneously referred to the statutory damages model for noteholders' Securities Act claims in endorsing their Exchange Act claims, which are not based on the statute.

Robbins Geller countered that the full record on class certification - including dueling expert witness reports, hundreds of pages of deposition testimony and a lengthy hearing in which Marbley grilled both sides about damages -- shows that the trial judge properly scrutinized the class methodologies. The firm also said its proposed model for calculating shareholders' damages is ""the gold-standard, well-accepted method.""

The 6th Circuit panel that granted FirstEnergy's petition did not say whether the court is more interested in the Affiliated Ute or Comcast issue. Both of the amicus briefs backing the company devoted more space to protesting Marbley's application of the lenient Affiliated Ute standard, though both also faulted the trial court's analysis of shareholders' damages model.

Thursday's order noted that one factor the 6th Circuit considers in weighing a request for interlocutory appeal is the likelihood that the petitioner will prevail. But that's certainly not a guarantee that FirstEnergy will get the class decertified. The company, after all, told the 6th Circuit that shareholders are alleging $8 billion in damages. The appeals court may just want to double-check the trial court in a huge case based on one of the biggest public schemes in recent memory.

FirstEnergy counsel Robert Giuffra of Sullivan & Cromwell said in an email statement that he and his client are ""pleased that the 6th Circuit will review these important questions regarding the certification of securities class actions, including over the scope of the Affiliated Ute presumption and what is needed to satisfy the requirements of Comcast.""

Robbins Geller declined to provide a statement.

Ironically, the 6th Circuit decision to review the FirstEnergy class certification came on the same day that Robbins Geller formally agreed to end a 13-year-old shareholder class action against Goldman Sachs, after its loss last August in one of the hardest-fought class certification battles in the history of securities litigation. (The Manhattan trial judge certified a Goldman shareholder class three times but Goldman ultimately convinced the 2nd Circuit to decertify the class, based on the Supreme Court's 2021 decision in its own case.)

Sullivan & Cromwell was Goldman's counsel throughout the saga, so the FirstEnergy interlocutory appeal renews its class certification rivalry with Robbins Geller.

Cody Barnett of the conservative legal group Alliance Defending Freedom, representing therapist Kaley Chiles, told the three-judge panel of the 10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Denver that the 2019 law was ""blatant viewpoint-based speech suppression,"" and that speech in a therapy session was protected like speech in any other context.

""It doesn't really matter that she's a licensed counselor,"" he said. ""If she is speaking, she is speaking.""

Colorado Deputy Solicitor General Helen Norton, arguing for the state, said that talk therapy was the practice of medicine, and that medical professionals are required to follow the standard of care in their field.

She noted that major organizations like the American Psychological Association have said that efforts to change sexual orientation or gender identity, known as conversion therapy, are ineffective and can harm mental health.

""This is the regulation of professional conduct, which is different"" from simply restricting speech, she said. She noted that states also regulate the practice of law to protect clients, even though it consists almost entirely of speech.

Chiles sued state officials in Denver federal court last year, saying she was unable to counsel patients consistent with her Christian beliefs because of the law.

U.S. District Judge Charlotte Sweeney in December 2022 denied Chiles' motion for a preliminary order blocking enforcement of the law while the case proceeds. Chiles appealed that order.

Circuit Judge Harris Hartz, who was appointed by Republican former president George W. Bush, asked repeated skeptical questions of the state during Friday's argument, pressing Norton to provide evidence that conversion therapy was harmful, rather than simply noting consensus among medical organizations.

Norton pointed to studies supporting the conclusion, though she conceded that they involved so-called ""aversive techniques"" that attempt to make a patient associate unwanted thoughts or behaviors with physical discomfort, like electric shocks. Chiles says she only wants to use talk therapy, not aversive techniques.

Circuit Judges Veronica Rossman and Nancy Moritz, both appointed by Democratic presidents, appeared more skeptical of Chiles' case, questioning Barnett's argument that talk therapy could not be regulated like other healthcare treatments.

Colorado is one of more than 20 Democratic-led states that have passed anti-conversion therapy laws. The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals last year upheld a Washington state ban against a similar challenge, in which the plaintiff was also represented by Alliance Defending Freedom.

The case is Chiles v. Salazar, 10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, No. 22-1445.

For Chiles: Cody Barnett of Alliance Defending Freedom

For the state: Colorado Deputy Solicitor General Helen Norton

Trump´s lawyers had urged Judge Arthur Engoron on Thursday to stop the case immediately, arguing he had irreparably harmed Trump´s right to a fair trial through ""astonishing departures from ordinary standards of impartiality."" They cited his rulings against their client, the prominent role of the judge´s chief law clerk, the clerk's political donations and the judge's sharing of articles about the case with fellow alumni of his high school.

""My principal law clerk does not make rulings or issue orders - I do,"" Engoron wrote, adding that ""my rulings are mine, and mine alone.""

As for publishing a high school newsletter in which he has included links to articles about himself and the case, ""none of this has anything to do with, much less does it interfere with, my presiding fairly, impartially, and professionally over the instant dispute, which I have now been doing for more than three years, and which I intend to do until its conclusion,"" he wrote.

Trump attorney Alina Habba released a statement saying: ""As expected, today the Court refused to take responsibility for its failure to preside over this case in an impartial and unbiased manner. We, however, remain undeterred and will continue to fight for our clients´ right to a fair trial.""

Messages seeking comment were sent to state Attorney General Letitia James' office, which brought the civil case now on trial. The lawsuit alleges that Trump, his company and top executives exaggerated his wealth by billions of dollars on his financial statements, which were given to banks, insurers and others to secure loans and make deals.

Trump and the other defendants deny any wrongdoing.

Last week, Engoron spurned the defense´s request to end the trial through what´s known as a directed verdict.

RISHI Sunak is working in secret with European allies in a plot to tear up rules so migrants can be sent to Rwanda.

The PM wants to join forces with Italy's Giorgia Meloni and leaders in Austria and Spain want to rewrite the European Court of Human Rights charter.

They hope the move will give them legal cover to send migrants to third countries for processing.

It comes after the Supreme Court ruled the Government's plan to send asylum seekers to Rwanda was unlawful

Downing Street is planning to bring in emergency legislation and a new treaty with Kigali to address issues in the judgment.

The PM -- accused by former Home Secretary Suella Braverman of ""tinkering"" with the original scheme -- said he would work ""night and day"" to ensure domestic courts can't ""systematically"" block deportation flights.

He said: ""We've got to get the Rwanda plan up and running. I will do whatever it takes to make that happen.

""People are sick of this merry-go-round. I want to end it. My patience is wearing thin.""

He threw down the gauntlet to Labour to help pass the legislation, especially in the Lords.

Mr Sunak said: ""We're determined to get this through.

""So the real question is: is the Labour Party going to stand in the way and stop this from happening, or are they going to work with us and support this Bill so we can get it through as quickly as possible?""

Trump's attorneys made the request on Thursday, claiming Judge Arthur Engoron and his law clerk had displayed bias and that he conferred with her so much it was as if they were ""co-judging"" the case. Engoron explicitly denied that claim on Friday, and called the motion ""without merit.""

""My rulings are mine, and mine alone. There is absolutely no 'co-judging' at play,"" Engoron wrote. The judge and his clerk, Allison Greenfield, have been the subject of fierce criticism by Trump and his lawyers, who claim they have overwhelmingly favored New York Attorney General Letitia James' side in the case.

The trial, which began Oct. 2 and is expected to last into December, stems from a September 2022 lawsuit in which James' office alleges that Trump, two of his sons and their company engaged in a decade of fraud tied to Trump's financial statements. James is seeking $250 million for the state and additional penalties that would restrict the defendants' ability to do business in New York.

Engoron found the defendants liable for fraud in a pretrial ruling. The trial is proceeding on other allegations related to falsification of business records, conspiracy and insurance fraud and the appropriate damages and penalties to be imposed.

Judge Engoron ruled that Trump and his campaign twice violated a limited gag order the judge put in place Oct. 3, after Trump posted a derogatory statement on social media about Greenfield. He's been ordered to pay $15,000 in fines related to the gag order violations.

In the motion for a mistrial, the Trump attorneys complained that Engoron consulted too frequently with Greenfield. Trump's attorneys announced plans to file it the day he testified in the case on Nov. 6, capping off an intense day of examination in which Trump -- who has frequently criticized Judge Engoron and his clerk -- even lashed out at the judge from the witness stand, pointing at him and calling him a ""fraud.""

In the filing, Trump's attorneys claim that ""the Court has abrogated its constitutional responsibility to ensure each Defendant, including President Trump, receives a fair trial free from even the appearance of impropriety and impartiality.""

Engoron wrote that he has an ""absolute unfettered right to consult with my law clerks in any way, shape, or form I choose.""

The attorney general had proposed a briefing schedule to address the mistrial motion, but Engoron ruled that was unnecessary, calling the motion itself ""without merit"" and writing ""subsequent briefing would therefore be futile.""

A total of 356 asylum seekers were intercepted by Border Force officials from seven boats and escorted into Dover, Kent, throughout the day.

Around 50 asylum seekers were picked up from an inflatable dinghy off the coast of Dover and brought to shore on Border Force catamaran Hurricane shortly before 10am.

The mostly male group, who were clad in hooded jackets and hats after battling chilly conditions at sea, could be seen removing their orange lifejackets as they were escorted along the former jetfoil to be taken for processing.

One man appeared to be limping as he linked arms with another migrant.

At least 40 more asylum seekers were escorted into the port on a Border Force catamaran shortly after midday, while a similar-sized group were brought in on another of the agency's vessels around an hour later.

They appeared cold, wrapping red blankets around their heads and shoulders as they disembarked the boat.

Four more dinghies carrying migrants were intercepted throughout the day.

This comes as the Supreme Court concluded unanimously that the Rwanda scheme to deport arrivals immediately would break the law.

President of the Supreme Court Lord Reed said there would be a risk of genuine asylum seekers being returned by Rwanda to the home country they fled from.

The decision immediately sparked Tory demands to loosen protections under the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) so the policy can go ahead.

At the time, Tory Party deputy chairman Lee Anderson said the Government should simply 'ignore the laws' and 'just put the planes in the air now and send them to Rwanda'.

Sacked Home Secretary Suella Braverman had accused Prime Minister Rishi Sunak of having 'no Plan B' if the policy was blocked by judges.

The PM responded to the Supreme Court ruling by pledging a new treaty with Rwanda and emergency legislation allowing Parliament to declare the East African country safe for asylum seekers.

And in a nod to the fury of the Tory Right, he insisted if that failed he was ready to ignore the European Convention on Human Rights rather than let 'foreign courts' stand in the way of action.

The PM said that planes should start leaving for Rwanda next Spring - although he would not guarantee the timetable.

'Let me tell everyone now - I will not allow a foreign court to block these flights,' Mr Sunak said.

'If the Strasbourg Court chooses to intervene against the express wishes of Parliament I am prepared to do whatever is necessary to get flights off.

'I will not take the easy way out.'

Just six asylum seekers were rescued from the Channel by French authorities after getting into difficulty while trying to make the crossing on Thursday, according to France's Prefecture Maritime.

A French escort vessel was pictured accompanying one of the migrant boats into English waters yesterday

In the early hours of the morning, the CROSS rescue centre in Cap Gris-Nez, northern France, was informed that a migrant boat was in difficulty off the coast of Equihen beach.

The French Navy boat Rhône picked up six people and dropped them off at the port of Boulogne later on in the morning, where they were taken care of by the departmental fire and rescue service and the border police.

A total of 971 people have crossed the Channel in 19 boats this month - an average of 51 people crammed into each vessel.

This brings the total number of small boat crossings so far this year to 27,670 in 565 inflatable dinghies.

Last year saw a record 45,755 people make the journey across the 21-mile Dover Strait.

This is 60 per cent higher than in 2021, when 28,526 asylum seekers reached the UK.","{'uri': 'dailymail.co.uk', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'Daily Mail Online'}",[],https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2023/11/17/20/77945323-0-image-a-27_1700254699369.jpg,eng-9063836,0.06666666666666665,25,25,Daily Mail Online,dailymail.co.uk

The ABA's Council of the Section of Legal Education and Admissions to the Bar, which oversees law schools, voted unanimously to send the free speech proposal to the ABA's House of Delegates in February for final approval. The ABA's law school accreditation rules have long protected the academic freedom of faculty, but this standard would be the first address free speech for the entire law school community.

The new rule would require all law schools to develop and publish policies that ""encourage and support the free expression of ideas."" Those policies, if the rule is adopted, must protect the rights of faculty and staff and students to communicate controversial or unpopular ideas and safeguard robust debate, demonstrations, or protests. They must also forbid disruptive activities that hinder free expression or substantially interfere with law school functions or activities.

The proposed rule does not include any specific enforcement mechanism, but law schools that do not adhere to the ABA's standards risk losing their accreditation.

Campus free speech debates have intensified since Hamas' Oct. 7 attack on Israel and Israel's responding assault on Gaza, with Israeli and Palestinian supporters clashing. But free speech has been a hot topic in legal education for more than two years following controversies at a several high-profile schools -- which played a role in developing the ABA's new free speech requirement.

Students at Stanford Law School and Yale Law School disrupted controversial speakers, sparking criticism of how the schools handled those situations. Stanford officials apologized to 5th U.S. Circuit Judge Stuart Kyle Duncan after students disrupted his remarks to the campus Federalist Society chapter in March. The law school also mandated free speech training for students.

Yale Law School said it bolstered its commitment to free speech after a group of students disrupted a campus discussion with an invited conservative speaker in March of 2022. That incident prompted two federal judges to later say they would not hire clerks from Yale.

ABA council members also said that efforts by lawmakers to restrict the teaching of subjects such as critical race theory also helped to spur the new free speech requirement. The ABA's House of Delegates will weigh final approval of the proposal when it meets on Feb. 5 in Louisville, Kentucky.

Please try again later{{ /verifyErrors }}

A federal judge heard arguments Friday from lawyers for a group of Indiana residents from Haiti who are suing the state over a law that allows immigrants in the U.S. on humanitarian parole to get driver's licenses, but only if they are from Ukraine.

The five plaintiffs say the law passed this year is discriminatory and unconstitutional, and they asked the court to strike down the law's provision that limits its scope to people from Ukraine.

U.S. District Court Judge Tanya Walton Pratt said she will issue a ruling at an unspecified date.

The lawsuit was filed in August against the Commissioner of the Indiana Bureau of Motor Vehicles. The plaintiffs are represented by attorneys with the American Civil Liberties Union of Indiana and the National Immigration Law Center.

The law provides an avenue for immigrants on humanitarian parole from Ukraine to obtain driver's licenses and identification cards. The class-action lawsuit seeks to force the Bureau of Motor Vehicles to offer the same opportunities to immigrants on humanitarian parole from other countries.

Attorneys argue in court documents that the law violates the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the equal protection clause of the U.S. Constitution. It also creates its own immigration classifications, which is an authority reserved by the federal government, they contend.

ACLU lawyer Gavin Rose described the law in court as ""a textbook example of national origin discrimination.""

Four of the five Haitian immigrants -- who are all on humanitarian parole -- live in rural areas without public transportation, according to court documents. They rely on others for rides to work and other everyday activities such as grocery shopping. The final plaintiff is a minor who wishes to receive an identification card, the documents state.

The lead plaintiff, Jeffson Saint-Hilaire, 25, said he came to the U.S. to provide for his mother and two sisters who live in Haiti.

""I just want to be self-sufficient, self reliable,"" he told reporters. ""But how can I do that without a driver's license?""

According to the complaint, Saint-Hilaire was admitted to the U.S. in March and is employed as an electrician's assistant. He has a second job as an interpreter, but he often has to turn down assignments due to his travel restrictions.

""It's very important for me. And not just me, but all these people here on humanitarian parole to get access to these driver's licenses,"" he said.

The state argues that the law was adopted to mirror provisions in Congress's Additional Ukraine Supplemental Appropriations Act, and therefore does not conflict with federal law or federal immigration classifications.

""Indiana's mode to be welcomed should be approved, not penalized,"" attorney William Bock said on behalf of the state.

Attorneys with the state also argue that restrictions in the law limit its scope to a certain time frame, which means it isn't available to all people from Ukraine.

However, the Haitians' attorneys say the time restrictions were specifically designed to aid people from Ukraine.

According to the state, 136 people whose last residence was Ukraine and who were put on humanitarian parole between February 2022 and this September have received driver's licenses under the new law.","{'uri': 'independent.co.uk', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'The Independent'}",[],https://static.independent.co.uk/2023/11/17/19/Indiana_Driver_Licenses-Discrimination_Lawsuit_71170.jpg?quality=75&width=1200&auto=webp,eng-9071964,-0.06666666666666665,25,25,The Independent,independent.co.uk

(KDKA) -- Two men are facing charges after police said a fight in Turtle Creek ended with shots fired and one of the men hitting the other with a car.

Allegheny County police said surveillance video of a fight outside a business on Penn Avenue in Turtle Creek on Thursday night showed 25-year-old Tyvon Stevenson punching 53-year-old Rattandeep Virk in the face.

The fight continued into the parking lot, where police said Stevenson took out a gun and pointed it at Virk. Investigators said no shots were fired, and surveillance video showed Stevenson leaving the plaza.

Police said Virk then got into his vehicle and drove along Penn Avenue. When he found Stevenson, investigators said Virk hit Stevenson with his vehicle multiple times.

After he was hit, police said Stevenson fired multiple shots toward the vehicle. Again, no one was hit by gunfire.

Police said their investigation began after dispatchers were notified shortly after 8 p.m. of shots fired and a pedestrian hit by a vehicle along Penn Avenue. Detectives from county police's General Investigations Unit were called in to investigate.

Stevenson was taken to a hospital to be treated for a lower leg injury and was last listed in stable condition, police said.

Virk was taken into custody on Friday and is facing multiple charges, including aggravated assault by vehicle, recklessly endangering another person, stalking and harassment. He's currently in the Allegheny County Jail pending his preliminary arraignment.

Stevenson was also charged with simple assault for the alleged fight outside the business.","{'uri': 'cbsnews.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'CBS News'}",[],https://assets3.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2023/10/30/e915d188-29be-43d2-b50e-8c786559d631/thumbnail/1200x630/9c4b1add9035d5876333ad03fb59bc64/gettyimages-1399782864.jpg?v=5659e73acd91751548aa89950cf015b0,,-0.388235294117647,25,25,CBS News,cbsnews.com

Donald Trump's lawyers on Friday argued that a limited gag order barring him from targeting witnesses constitutes judicial overreach and a grievous violation of the First Amendment.

The claim, made in an appeals court filing ahead of a hearing next week, seeks to permanently lift an order imposed by U.S. District Judge Tanya Chutkan last month in the federal case Trump faces for his efforts to remain in office after losing the 2020 presidential election, culminating in the Jan. 6, 2021, Capitol riot.

Chutkan's Oct. 16 order never barred Trump from speaking broadly about the case, in which he has pleaded not guilty. Instead, it narrowly constrained the former president and 2024 hopeful from targeting prosecutors, court staffers and potential witnesses.

Despite that, Trump's lawyers repeatedly described the order Friday as a ban on their client's broader political speech, painting Trump as the victim of ""a single federal judge"" whose court ""had no business inserting itself into the Presidential election, just weeks before the Iowa caucuses.""

""Criminal proceedings do not suspend the First Amendment; if anything, they heighten the need for First Amendment protections,"" they wrote in the brief.

Chutkan had temporarily lifted the order on Oct. 20 -- a reprieve Trump took advantage of to target Mark Meadows, his former chief of staff, amid reports that Meadows had been granted immunity to testify against him.

Soon after Chutkan suspended the order, Trump published a characteristically bizarre outburst on social media, wondering aloud if Meadows was a weakling and coward who would make a deal with prosecutors.

Chutkan reimposed the gag order after that post. A U.S. Court of Appeals decision then temporarily lifted the order, again, earlier this month, noting as it did so that the pause ""should not be construed in any way as a ruling on the merits.""

On Nov. 20, both sides are scheduled to argue before the appeals court as it considers a ruling on the matter.

In a separate civil fraud trial Thursday, a New York appeals court judge also paused a gag order against Trump that limited what he could say about court staffers. Shortly thereafter, Trump, who'd previously violated the order twice, went on an angry tirade focused on the judge and a court clerk.","{'uri': 'huffpost.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'HuffPost'}",[],https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/6557acd1220000b91518e4ec.jpeg?cache=y55yT33Uod&ops=1200_630,eng-9065743,-0.2470588235294118,25,25,HuffPost,huffpost.com

(AP) - Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis´ board appointees are seeking communications between Disney and local media, as well as documents related to the company´s position on Florida´s so-called ""Don´t Say Gay"" law, as part of a state court fight over control of the district that governs Walt Disney World.

The request for documents and communications was made Thursday by the Central Florida Tourism Oversight District, now controlled by DeSantis appointees. It sued Disney this year over control of the private government which regulates design and construction and provides municipal services such as mosquito control and road repairs at the Florida theme park resort.

The district wants all Disney communications about DeSantis, as well as communications dealing with laws passed by the Republican-dominated Florida Legislature that switched control of the district from Disney supporters to the governors´ appointees and nullified deals the company made with the Disney-controlled district before the state takeover.

The Central Florida Tourism Oversight District, formerly called the Reedy Creek Improvement District, was controlled by Disney allies for more than five decades until it was taken over by DeSantis appointees earlier this year. The takeover of the district came after Disney publicly opposed a state law banning classroom lessons on sexual orientation and gender identity in early grades. The law, dubbed by opponents as ""Don't Say Gay,"" was championed by DeSantis, who currently is running for the 2024 GOP presidential nomination.

Before control of the district changed hands from Disney allies to DeSantis appointees, the Disney supporters on its board signed agreements with Disney shifting control over design and construction at Disney World to the company. The new DeSantis appointees claimed the ""eleventh-hour deals"" neutered their powers, and the district sued the company in state court to have the contracts voided.

Disney has filed counterclaims which include asking the state court to declare the agreements valid and enforceable.

Advocates this year have been trying to remove Trump from the ballot in Colorado and other states under Section Three of the 14th Amendment, which bars from office those who swore an oath to uphold the U.S. Constitution and then ""engaged in insurrection"" against it. The measure has only been used a handful of times since the period after the Civil War.

Closing arguments in the lawsuit, which was filed by the left-leaning group Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, wrapped up on Wednesday. Sean Grimsley, an attorney for the petitioners, argued that Trump engaged in an insurrection by inciting a violent mob to attack the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6 to try to stop the peaceful transfer of power. He says that makes him ineligible to hold office under the 14th Amendment. Trump attorney Scott Gessler says there's no evidence that Trump intended to incite violence and violence, he says, doesn't equal an insurrection.

Gessler said the lawsuit amounts to election interference and is based entirely on the Jan. 6 Committee's report which he says is completely one-sided.

""The petitioners are asking this court to do something that's never been done in the history of the United States,"" Gessler said. ""The evidence doesn't come close to allowing the court to do it.""

The trial, which ended two weeks ago, included testimony from D.C. riot police, rally goers, constitutional experts, and two members of Congress.

The Colorado plaintiffs' attorney, Sean Grimsley, told the judge during Wednesday's hearing that the evidence was clear.

""We are here because, for the first time in our nation's history, the president of the United States engaged in an insurrection,"" he said, summing up their case. ""Now he wants to be president again. The Constitution does not allow that.""

If they can keep Trump off the primary ballot in enough states, advocates hope to keep him from getting the needed delegates to secure the Republican presidential nomination.

Regardless of the judge's decision, the case is all but certain to be appealed all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court.

Similar lawsuits challenging Trump's ballot eligibility under the 14th Amendment have failed recently in Michigan and Minnesota. The Minnesota Supreme Court dodged the question of whether the provision applies to Trump, who is so far dominating the Republican presidential primary. It dismissed a lawsuit to toss him off that state's primary ballot by saying that political parties can allow whomever they want to qualify for primaries. The court left the door open for a general election challenge if Trump becomes the GOP nominee. AMichigan judge dismissed another lawsuit seeking to bounce Trump from that state's primary ballot with a more sweeping ruling. He said whether the provision applies to the former president is a ""political question"" to be settled by Congress, not judges. The liberal group that filed the Michigan case, Free Speech For People, said it plans to appeal the decision.

The Trump campaign has called the lawsuits ""election interference"" and an ""anti-democratic"" attempt to stop voters from having the choice they want next November.","{'uri': 'cbsnews.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'CBS News'}",[],https://assets1.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2023/11/16/e8fe01fc-c63d-414d-9d9b-fd16f2d84e4a/thumbnail/1200x630/9fc2cd33a98ac9c0fa94927dd69d1513/l-trump-ballot-trial-5vo-frame-874.jpg?v=5659e73acd91751548aa89950cf015b0,eng-9068426,-0.2235294117647059,25,25,CBS News,cbsnews.com

The legal setback for the embattled politician came the same day that a West African regional court dismissed his case seeking his reinstatement. Sonko was recently returned to a Dakar jail after being hospitalized for several weeks amid a hunger strike.

Senegal's government formally dissolved Sonko's political party earlier this year and canceled his voter registration after he was convicted of corrupting youth. His followers maintain the charge and prosecution were politically motivated and aimed at derailing his candidacy in the February election.

A court in the southern city of Ziguinchor, where Sonko serves as mayor, ruled in favor of restoring him to the voter rolls but the Supreme Court ""quashed and annulled"" that decision, according to Sonko attorney Cire Cledor Ly. The case was remanded to the Dakar high court, he said.

Senegalese authorities have refused to give Sonko the sponsorship papers needed to officially register his candidacy.

Sonko, who finished third in the country's last presidential election, was widely seen as the main challenger to President Macky Sall´s ruling party. Sall ultimately decided not to seek a third term in office after Sonko´s supporters launched months of protests that at times turned deadly.

In June, Sonko was acquitted on charges of raping a woman who worked at a massage parlor and making death threats against her. But he was convicted of corrupting youth and sentenced to two years in prison, which ignited deadly protests across the country.

In late July, Senegalese authorities formally dissolved Sonko´s political party and placed him in detention. He is now facing charges of calling for insurrection, conspiracy against the state and other alleged crimes.

Sonko also had appealed to the Court of Justice of the regional bloc ECOWAS to contest both the dissolution of his party and the striking of his voter registration, but that court ruled Friday ""that none of Mr. Ousmane Sonko´s rights had been violated and dismissed his claims,"" Ly said.

DAKAR, Nov 17 (Reuters) - The presidential ambitions of jailed Senegalese opposition leader Ousmane Sonko suffered two setbacks on Friday after the Supreme Court annulled a lower court's decision ordering his reinstatement in the voter roll.

Separately, a West African regional court backed the government of Senegal in a legal battle with Sonko, who had filed a case claiming the state violated his human rights.

Sonko, 49, has faced a flurry of court cases over the past two years for charges including libel and rape, which he denies.

He was arrested in July for insurrection, the government dissolved his party, and he has been struck off the electoral roll, ruling him out of a presidential election next February.

A court in the southern town of Ziguinchor where his is the mayor, had ruled last month that Sonko should be reinstated in the voter roll and sponsorship sheets for the presidential election be handed to him, enabling him to run in the vote.

Following an appeal by the state, the Supreme Court annulled the Ziguinchor court, asking for the case to be decided afresh by a court of appeal in the capital, Dakar.

""I note that the court has transferred the baby to another jurisdiction, while there is no deadline set,"" Sonko's lawyer Cire Cledor Ly told journalists outside the court.

""We are moving towards a situation where Sonko will be prevented from getting the sponsorship sheet and submitting his candidacy (for the election),"" he said.

Earlier, the Community Court of Justice of the regional ECOWOS bloc rejected Sonko's claim that the state has treated him unfairly.

Sonko's charges and arrests have become a flashpoint in Senegal, triggering rioting this year in which at least 16 people died - the worst unrest in decades in the largely peaceful West African country.

His supporters say the charges are politically motivated and are part of President Macky Sall's serial targeting of political opponents, which Sall denies. Sonko has gone on hunger strikes in protest and has been admitted to hospital on occasion.

On what planet is our prime minister living (Rishi Sunak to bring in emergency law after supreme court's Rwanda ruling, 15 November)? Having failed miserably to get his odious Rwanda policy through the courts, he now plans to introduce ""emergency legislation"" to declare that Rwanda is a safe country.

Even if this were legally possible, how can the UK possibly monitor this? How could we ensure in practice that Rwanda meets its international obligations towards refugees, so that our own new law actually works in reality, especially as the supreme court makes it clear that Rwanda is currently a long way from being a safe country? It's completely unworkable.

This is fairytale politics. All Rishi Sunak has done with his ill-considered, panic-stricken response to the court ruling is to give us a further demonstration of his absolute desperation and his appalling judgment.

Clive Hurren

Conwy

The problem with Rishi Sunak's plan to pass a law declaring Rwanda to be safe is that a law cannot make a fact otherwise. The supreme court gave good reasons why Rwanda was not a safe destination, and this fact will not be changed by any UK law. Nor will it be possible to prevent the European court of human rights from stopping deportation flights, unless the UK withdraws from the treaty that set it up.

Ultimately, the boats cannot be stopped without changes in the countries that asylum seekers come from, except by action that would damage Britain's international standing. That is why I believe it will not happen; nor will refugees be sent to Rwanda before the next election, as the Conservatives promise. A more humane way of treating refugees will have to be found.

Miland Joshi

It is extraordinary that the UK government should base its policy on the expectation that Rwanda will observe its human rights and international legal obligations when the prime minister and many in his party appear willing to implement that policy in disregard of the UK's similar obligations because they conflict with ""the will of the people"" (in reality, government policy).

Suella Braverman wants to act like a dictator with her alternative hardline Rwanda plan, a former Cabinet minister has claimed as he compared her to Vladimir Putin.

Responding to the former home secretary's five-point Rwanda plan set out in The Telegraph, Damian Green, the former deputy prime minister, said her proposal to pass a law that would block Rwanda deportation appeals was ""profoundly unconservative"".

In an interview on BBC Radio 4, Mr Green, chairman of the One Nation Conservative Caucus, said he ""disliked and opposed"" it because it would ""sweep away"" all judicial review protection for asylum seekers. ""It's not just all our own laws passed by Parliament, and all international treaties that we have signed, that Suella wants to sweep away,"" he said.

""She specifically says let's sweep away all judicial review protection and all common law protections, and that's why I said on Twitter that this is the most unconservative proposal I have ever heard.

""Conservatives believe in a democratic country run by the rule of law. And dictators, Xi [Jinping] and Putin would prefer to have the state completely untrammelled by any law. And so, as a democrat, I oppose it.

""But quite specifically as a conservative, because if we conservatives don't believe that the state should be controlled by the law, that the Government has to obey the law as much as you or I have to obey the law, then that seems to me to be very profoundly unconservative.""

'Whatever is required'

In her Telegraph article on Thursday, Mrs Braverman warned that the Prime Minister's new treaty and law declaring Rwanda a safe country would not enable the flights to take off for Rwanda before the general election. She branded it a ""tweaked version"" of the failed original Plan A rather than an effective Plan B.

Instead, she called for the new emergency legislation to block ""all avenues of legal challenge"" against the flights by excluding them from the ""entirety"" of European and human rights laws.

This would be coupled with amendments to the Rwanda agreement to answer the criticisms by the Supreme Court, which ruled the policy unlawful on Wednesday, new rules to deport migrants more quickly, tougher powers to detain illegal migrants and a commitment to deliver the legal changes by the Christmas recess.

""There is no longer any chance of stopping the boats within the current legal framework,"" said Mrs Braverman.

Menendez's Winston lawyers on Thursday asked a U.S. judge in Manhattan to let them withdraw from the criminal case. Paul Hastings said three partners, including veteran trial lawyer Robert Luskin, will represent Menendez.

Menendez, a New Jersey Democrat who was until recently chair of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, and his wife Nadine face a raft of corruption charges. They have pleaded not guilty.

Attorneys for Menendez did not give a reason for the switch. Representatives for Winston did not respond to requests for comment, and neither did a spokesperson for Menendez. Paul Hastings declined to comment other than confirming the defense team for Menendez.

U.S. District Judge Sidney Stein on Friday issued an order allowing Menendez's Winston lawyers to withdraw.

Chicago-founded Winston and Paul Hastings, which has headquarters in Los Angeles, are both large law firms known for their white-collar defense work, corporate litigation and other matters.

Luskin, a prominent Washington, D.C.-based Paul Hastings partner, is separately representing casino magnate Steve Wynn in a Justice Department lawsuit accusing him of failing to register as a foreign agent for China. Wynn defeated the lawsuit in the trial court, and the government has appealed.

In another matter, Luskin represents former Trump-era U.S. ambassador Gordon Sondland in a lawsuit to recoup legal fees related to his testimony at the first impeachment inquiry of then-President Donald Trump.

Luskin is working with Paul Hastings partners Avi Weitzman, co-leader of the complex litigation group at Paul Hastings, and Adam Fee.

Weitzman represents Hanoch ""Nuke"" Goldstein, a co-founder of bankrupt crypto lender Celsius in a lawsuit filed by the Federal Trade Commission.

Winston is home to veteran trial lawyer Abbe Lowell, who represented Menendez in a prior corruption case that ended in a mistrial in 2017.

Several media outlets reported in September that Lowell was representing Menendez in the new indictment. Lowell had not made any appearance in the case. He did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Lowell is defending President Joe Biden's son Hunter Biden on U.S. tax and firearm charges in Delaware federal court.

Nadine Menendez is represented by defense lawyers at the small Washington, D.C. firm Schertler Onorato Mead & Sears. Her defense lawyers declined to comment on Friday on Bob Menendez's move to hire new lawyers.

A trial in the case is set for May 2024 in Manhattan federal district court.

Kayatta, an appointee of Democratic former President Barack Obama, informed the White House in a letter made public on Friday that he plans to assume senior status following the confirmation of a successor.

Senior status is a form of semi-retirement for judges over the age of 65 who have completed at least 15 years on the federal bench. Presidents may name new full-time judges to fill those judges' seats.

""Assuming senior status will allow me to continue my own public service while also allowing a younger generation to have more of a voice in the court's work,"" Kayatta, 70, told Reuters in an email.

The new vacancy will give Biden a chance to name almost all of the judges on the six-member court. He has already appointed three judges--Gustavo Gelpí, Lara Montecalvo and Julie Rikelman--and in October nominated a fourth, Seth Aframe.

The sixth active member is Chief U.S. Circuit Judge David Barron, who like Kayatta is an appointee of Obama.

The 1st Circuit is the only of the 12 federal appeals courts whose active judges were all appointed by Democratic presidents. The lone Republican appointee when Biden took office, Jeffrey Howard, took senior status last year.

The court is the smallest of the circuit courts and hears cases from Maine, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Rhode Island and Puerto Rico.

Kayatta had been a partner at the law firm Pierce Atwood in Portland, Maine for more than 25 years when Obama first nominated to serve on the 1st Circuit in 2012. He won Senate confirmation in 2013.

He was part of the three-judge panel that in 2020 overturned Boston Marathon bomber Dzhokhar Tsarnaev's death sentence for his role in the 2013 attack that killed three people and wounded more than 260 others.

The U.S. Supreme Court in 2022 reversed that decision, but a 1st Circuit panel that Kayatta was also on appeared open during arguments in January to again overturning his death sentence on grounds the high court did not consider.

Last year, Kayatta wrote for a three-judge panel that grand jury records stemming from the investigation of the leak of the Pentagon Papers more than 50 years ago must remain secret despite any historical significance they might have.

He is also on the panel that in July heard Mexico's appeal of the dismissal of its $10 billion lawsuit seeking to hold U.S. gun manufacturers responsible for facilitating the trafficking of weapons to drug cartels across the U.S.-Mexico border.

Greg Abbott, the Texas governor, is expected to sign two right-wing immigration bills, setting off a likely constitutional battle over a new law that allows state and local police to arrest anyone suspected of crossing the Texas-Mexico border without documentation.

SB4, one of the harshest anti-immigration laws in US history, makes it a state crime to cross into Texas from another country without papers.

State judges are now required to order a migrant to return to the country they came from in lieu of prosecution. If the migrant refuses the judge's order, they could face a felony charge and up to 20 years in prison. SB4 also gives Texas officers the ability to arrest anyone who they believe has crossed into the state illegally, a power that immigrant advocates and Democrats have decried as racist.

""This is un-American,"" said Texas state representative Jolanda Jones, a Democrat. ""It will victimize people from the southern border, people of Latino descent.""

Jones told the Guardian that SB4 is ""state sanctioned"" racism against Latinos, noting that the new law does not contain a remedy for Americans who are wrongfully detained, arrested, or deported by sheriffs or state police.

""It will separate children from their parents,"" Jones said.

The controversial state law is the newest anti-immigration brainchild of Texas Republicans. In June,Abbott bussed migrants to Democratic-led cities without proper coordination. That same month, Texas launched Operation Lone Star, a multimillion-dollar initiative that has placed razor wire and thousands of troops at the Texas-Mexico border.

This week, the Republican governor is also slated to sign SB3, which allocates a whopping $1.5bn in tax dollars toward Texas border security measures. The high price tag of the new law ""includes paying for additional overtime expenses and costs"" of state troopers to patrol Colony Ridge, a housing development near Houston.

Colony Ridge became a focus of the Abbott administration after The Daily Wire, a far-right media outlet, called the development a ""magnet for illegal immigrants.""

Jones lambasted the new surge in border spending as fiscally irresponsible.

""This funding could and should be used to increase funding for public schools, public hospitals, neighborhood clinics, affordable housing, mental health facilities just to name a few,"" Jones told the Guardian.

Both anti-immigration laws have been widely criticized by Texas Democrats, but SB4 has also drawn condemnation from bipartisan legal groups and the Mexican government.

A group of more than two dozen former immigration judges signed a statement this week calling SB 4 unconstitutional. The signatories included judges who had been appointed by both Republican and Democratic administrations.

""Our personal politics may vary, but we dedicated our careers to the equal and fair administration of federal immigration law,"" the statement said, adding that SB4 should ""offend those who treasure our constitutional protections"".

Removing noncitizens from the US falls under the jurisdiction of the federal government. Immigration law is strictly the purview of the federal government, not individual states, in part because immigration is a major part of US foreign relations.

""Mexico in particular is a relationship that is important and central to how the federal government controls our border,"" said Emma Winger, deputy legal director of the American Immigration Council. ""What Texas is saying is that they are going to force people, many people who may not be Mexican citizens, to return to Mexico.""

In a statement released on 15 November, Mexico's secretary of foreign relations said the Mexican government ""categorically rejects"" SB4. Abbott's signature sets the stage for a standoff between Texas law enforcement officials and the federal government of Mexico.

Texas Republicans know that SB4 will likely invite legal challenges from either the Biden administration, immigration advocates, or both.

""Part of the reason for passing this law is to send a message to the Biden administration that Texas is going to go as far as it dares, and they don't care whether they lose in court, they're making a political statement,"" said Stephen Yale-Loehr, an immigration law professor at Cornell University.

Yale-Loehr said a legal challenge against SB4 would likely succeed, but court battles can take several years. In the meantime, Texas Republicans hope the threat of deportation will discourage migrants from crossing the southern border.

Immigration advocates like Yale-Loehr and Winger are especially concerned about the new law's interim effect on asylum seekers. Under federal law, all people who enter the United States have one year to apply for asylum, regardless of legal status. The new Texas statute means that undocumented immigrants in the process of applying for asylum could be deported from the United States, even if their case is still pending.

""These are people who have presented themselves to border patrol agents in hopes of getting legal protection here,"" Winger said. ""Texas is now saying that those people can be prosecuted, they can be jailed, and then they can be forcibly removed from the country.""","{'uri': 'theguardian.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","[{'uri': 'ava_sasani@theguardian.com', 'name': 'Ava Sasani', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': False}]",https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1917db324f8936d7cbce9ef21332d69d18beb016/0_0_5727_3436/master/5727.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&s=255017e5faad5297cd1a3468fa6a64d9,eng-9062380,-0.5137254901960784,25,25,The Guardian,theguardian.com

X, formerly Twitter, sued the Center for Countering Digital Hate in July, accusing it of trying to drive advertisers away through a ""scare campaign"" showing hate speech and other harmful content appeared to be overwhelming the platform.

According to the complaint, X lost tens of millions of dollars of ad revenue from ""false and misleading"" research reports that the center issued to create an ""ideological echo chamber"" for its preferred views.

This week, Musk, the world's richest person, sparked an outcry after endorsing as ""the actual truth"" an antisemitic post on X that falsely accused Jews of hating white people.

In a Thursday night filing in San Francisco federal court, the Center for Countering Digital Hate said X made up claims about how it gathered data from the platform, with each theory ""flimsier and more absurd than the last.""

The nonprofit also called the ""ridiculous"" and ""baseless"" lawsuit an attempt to silence others who say things X may not like. It also denied X's claim that commercial rivals and perhaps even foreign governments were funding its activities.

""X Corp's grievance is not that the CCDH defendants gathered public data in violation of obscure (and largely imagined) contract terms, but that they criticized X Corp (forcefully) to the public,"" the nonprofit said. ""Fortunately, state and federal free speech protections cannot be so easily evaded.""

A lawyer for X did not immediately respond on Friday to requests for comment.

Since buying Twitter for $44 billion in October 2022, Musk has faced much criticism for firing too many people who policed misinformation on the platform, and for allowing more harmful and abusive posts.

In September, X sued California to block the state from enforcing a law requiring that social media companies publish policies for policing misinformation, harassment, hate speech and extremism.

X said the law, Assembly Bill 587, violates its free speech rights. A federal judge will begin reviewing whether to enjoin the law in late November.

The case is X Corp v. Center for Countering Digital Hate Inc et al, U.S. District Court, Northern District of California, No. 23-03836.","{'uri': 'reuters.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'Reuters'}","[{'uri': 'jonathan_stempel@reuters.com', 'name': 'Jonathan Stempel', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': False}]",https://www.reuters.com/resizer/GrkVeD1th-TT-W-TYqnHuvBGD_Y=/1200x628/smart/filters:quality(80)/cloudfront-us-east-2.images.arcpublishing.com/reuters/43HJZHUTZRKXLPYOTF4PV5QYHU.jpg,eng-9059967,-0.5058823529411764,25,25,Reuters,reuters.com

On Thursday, former Sgt. Kyle Gould pleaded guilty to charges of duty to report use of force and duty to intervene in his death in Clear Creek County Court.

On Friday, the Fifth Judicial District Attorney announced charges for six additional officers who were present on June 11, 2022 when Glass was shot and killed.

Georgetown Marshal Randy Williams has been charged with duty to intervene and 3rd degree assault; Georgetown Police Officer Timothy Collins, Idaho Springs Police Officer Brittany Morrow, Colorado State Trooper Ryan Bennie, and Division of Gaming Officers Christa Lloyd and Mary J. Harris have all been charged with duty to intervene. All charges are class 1 misdemeanors.

""Law enforcement officers must be held accountable for their actions when performing their trusted public service duties. Yesterday, my office filed additional charges against each of the six other officers who were present June 11, 2022, for failing to intervene in the events and actions of Andrew Buen, which led to Christian Glass' death,"" said Heidi McCollum, 5th Judicial District Attorney in a statement.

Glass, 22, was shot and killed in Colorado's high country in 2022 after he called 911 for help when his car broke down. It happened in Silver Plume and officers from several different law enforcement agencies responded. Glass told an emergency dispatcher he had two knives, a hammer and a rubber mallet. His family's attorney says that is because he was an amateur geologist.

Over the span of an hour, officers told him he needed to get out of his car and dismissed attempts to drop the weapons out of his window. Glass refused to leave the car, saying he was scared. As things escalated, officers broke a window in an attempt to get him out and Glass grabbed one of the knives. Officers then tased him. Body cam video then showed Glass beginning to swing the knife wildly with his arm. That's when an officer or officers shot him.

Gould was fired from the Clear Creek County Sheriff's Office a year ago after being indicted by a grand jury. As part of his plea deal, Gould agreed that he cannot serve as a police officer or security officer ever again in the state of Colorado.

While Gould's case has wrapped up, another former Clear Creek deputy, Andrew Buen, is fighting his charges of second-degree murder, official misconduct and reckless endangerment. He is scheduled to appear in court on Dec. 20 for a motions hearing in the case.","{'uri': 'cbsnews.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'CBS News'}",[],https://assets1.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2022/11/24/8ac413a5-4c35-44fe-a7f0-9a00c78d80ab/thumbnail/1200x630g4/41f84005fdc8ea8a0b6ee6304001d1a5/clear-creek-county-indictment-10-vo-transfer-frame-937.jpg?v=5659e73acd91751548aa89950cf015b0,eng-9069006,-0.4117647058823529,25,25,CBS News,cbsnews.com

The ruling comes after Azerbaijan in September retook the contested region of Nagorno-Karabakh in a lightning offensive, after decades of enmity between Baku and Yerevan. The military action prompted the mass exodus of most of its 120,000 ethnic Armenians to neighbouring Armenia.

Yerevan accused Azerbaijan of ethnic cleansing and asked the International Court of Justice, as the World Court is formally known, to issue emergency measures aimed at protecting the rights of ethnic Armenians from Nagorno-Karabakh.

""Azerbaijan must (...) ensure that persons who have left Nagorno-Karabakh after 19 September, 2023 and who wish to return to Nagorno-Karabakh are able to do so in a safe, unimpeded and expeditious manner"", presiding judge Joan Donoghue said.

The court said Azerbaijan must also make sure any ethnic Armenians still living in the enclave are ""free from the use of force or intimidation that may cause them to flee"" and ordered that Baku report to the court in two months to show what it is doing to comply with the order.

Representatives of Azerbaijan had already told the court in hearings in October that they would allow the return of residents who fled Nagorno-Karabakh and keep all inhabitants of the enclave safe.

The measures are part of two competing legal disputes between Armenia and Azerbaijan before the ICJ. Both states accuse each of violating a U.N. anti-discrimination treaty.

No date has been set for the main case and a final ruling is not expected before well into next year.

It ticks through the cases against Trump in Georgia, New York, Washington, and Florida, singling out Fulton County, Georgia, District Attorney Fani Willis for ""using a witch hunt as a guise to arrest a former president and make him take a mugshot,"" and Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg of Manhattan for letting the city ""fall to pieces,"" while Judge Arthur Engoron ""laughed and smirked"" as Trump awaited trial.

""Even now they're resorting to insane legal theories to take him off the ballot,"" the ad continues. ""They've gone after a President of the United States. Do you think they'll stop there?""

It's a message that mirrors Trump's efforts to cast his legal woes as the work of a weaponized justice system that won't hesitate to turn on its political adversaries -- and a preview of what's to come next year.

Led by Mike Davis, Article III Project was founded in an effort to press for conservative judicial and other key nominees but evolved into an attack vector targeting Democratic nominations after Biden took office. It took a bare-knuckle approach to the confirmation of Supreme Court Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson over her sentencing record in child porn cases.

The former chief counsel for nominations to GOP Sen. Chuck Grassley, Davis has worked to confirm Justices Brett Kavanaugh and Neil Gorsuch, for whom he later clerked on the Supreme Court.

Davis has filled a messaging void to defend Trump that establishment Republican fixtures have largely avoided.

In a statement to NBC News, Davis said Trump's political opponents are using their legal powers to thwart the former president's reelection prospects, attacks that could upend our political system.

""These judges and prosecutors are leftwing partisan activists masquerading as public servants,"" Davis said. ""They've weaponized law enforcement and the judiciary to take out the leading candidate for President of the United States. Americans need to know what is happening in their country.""

A combative former Republican White House and Senate aide and cable news fixture, Davis has been at the forefront of the public defense of Trump since the FBI executed a search warrant at the former president's Mar-a-Lago residence in August 2022 to seize more than 100 classified documents he had previously been asked to return.

Davis has since argued against the indictments facing Trump in Georgia, Florida, Manhattan, and Washington, D.C., a New York civil fraud case, and the efforts underway in certain states to bar him from the ballot in 2024 under the 14th Amendment.","{'uri': 'nbcnews.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'NBC News'}",[],"https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_nbcnews-fp-1024-512,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2023-11/231117-donald-trump-mjf-1038-4110c5.jpg",,-0.2313725490196078,25,25,NBC News,nbcnews.com

Barely an hour after a gag order prohibiting Donald Trump from commenting about court staff at his civil fraud trial in New York was temporarily lifted, he was at it again - unleashing a blitzkrieg of social media outrage at a clerk who has become the lightning rod for the former president's rage.

On Thursday afternoon a New York appeals court judge, David Friedman, paused a gag order that had been placed on Trump last month. The move opened a window through which Trump could vent his unrestrained feelings.

The opportunity was seized upon almost immediately. An hour after the lifting of the gag order, one of Trump's inner circle, senior adviser Jason Miller, took to X, the social media site formerly known as Twitter.

""There's no way President Trump can receive a fair trial when Democrats are sending partisan attack dogs to do their dirty work,"" he said. Then he linked to a website devoted to attacking Allison Greenfield, the clerk who has been assisting the judge in the case, Arthur Engoron, at the $250m civil lawsuit trial in which the fate of the former president's New York-based family business, the Trump Organization, hangs.

The site labels Greenfield a ""Democrat operative and hack"" and accuses her of ""unethical partisan Democrat activities"". It also suggests that Engoron should be ""investigated and removed from the bench"".

Not long after that, Trump himself entered the fray. On his own social media platform, Truth Social, he attacked Greenfield as a ""politically biased and out of control, Trump-hating clerk"".

He also accused Engoron of driving businesses and jobs out of New York city, and derided Letitia James, the New York attorney general bringing the suit against him, as a ""worldwide disgrace"".

Trump is at trial in the civil lawsuit in New York over claims that the Trump Organization fraudulently inflated the value of its assets for financial benefit. Trump, his sons Eric and Don Jr, and other Trump Organization executives are all implicated. His daughter Ivanka is not a defendant but was required by the prosecution to give testimony as a witness. Donald Trump also took the stand in a dramatic appearance.

Engoron has already issued a pre-trial summary judgement finding Trump guilty of fraud and revoking his business license. Trump is appealing. The trial in Manhattan is to thrash out the details of the fraud.

Engoron imposed the gag order on Trump on 3 October after the former president posted a picture of Greenfield together with Chuck Schumer, the Democratic majority leader in the US senate, which had been drawn from her Instagram feed. Trump mocked the court clerk as ""Schumer's girlfriend"".

The judge said the gag order was necessary to protect his staff from threats. He said his chambers had receives hundreds of threatening phone calls, letters and packages. He did not impose a gag in relation to himself.

Trump has already been found to be in violation of the gag order, and was fined $15,000.

At an emergency hearing on Thursday, however, Friedman, sitting in New York state's intermediate appeals court, found that Trump's first amendment right to free speech was prime. He stayed the gag order.

Trump has faced similar restrictions on his speech imposed by a federal judge, Tanya Chutkan, in the criminal prosecution over his attempts to overturn the 2020 presidential election. That gag order has also been frozen by a federal appeals court.

On Wednesday, Trump filed a motion for a mistrial in the New York civil case. The motion accuses Engoron of ""bias"" and ""improper co-judging"" on the bench.","{'uri': 'theguardian.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","[{'uri': 'ed_pilkington@theguardian.com', 'name': 'Ed Pilkington', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': False}]",https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/398755f8ef26680f54f15705cb4f31016fc49f85/0_200_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&s=9f1cc4a2d6d81c71c40d9c2da15d3e78,eng-9065743,-0.2862745098039216,25,25,The Guardian,theguardian.com

A West African regional court on Friday dealt a severe blow to detained Senegalese opposition leader Ousmane Sonko's chances at running for president, with his political fate now resting with Senegal's Supreme Court.

In the latest twist of a long-running legal battle, the Economic Community of West African States court in Nigeria's capital Abuja said the ""state of Senegal did not violate any of (Sonko's) rights.""

Lawyers for Sonko -- who came third in the 2019 presidential election -- took his case to the ECOWAS court in order to challenge his removal from the electoral lists following his conviction in June.

The delisting made the 49-year-old firebrand politician ineligible to stand in Senegal's February 2024 presidential election.

The West African court ruling comes on the same day that Senegal's Supreme Court is due to rule on whether to reinstate Sonko on the electoral roll.

It is widely considered to be Sonko's last chance to contest the election.

""The ECOWAS Court of Justice gives (Senegalese President) Macky Sall the go-ahead to destroy his opponent,"" Juan Branco, one of Sonko's lawyers, said on social media.

The hearing in Senegal's capital Dakar opened early Friday under a heavy police presence, an AFP journalist saw.

Lawyers from both camps as well as opposition activists were present in the courtroom as the hearing continued around midday.

- Call to 'resist' -

Sonko, a political thorn in Sall's side, has faced a series of legal woes over the past two and a half years.

His conviction in a moral corruption case in June triggered the deadliest clashes the West African nation had seen in years.

He and his lawyers say the court cases are part of a plot to torpedo his political career.

He is popular among the under-20-year-olds, who make up half the population, for his pan-Africanist rhetoric and tough stance on former colonial power, France.

Late on Thursday, Sonko called on people in the country to ""resist"", claiming the ""nation's destiny"" was at stake.

""We must stand up for fair, free and independent justice, for the right to live in a country without fear of being arrested and imprisoned without justification,"" he declared on social media.

Dakar remained calm on Friday morning.

The interior ministry has refused to issue Sonko the necessary sponsorship forms for his candidacy.

Sonko was on June 1 convicted in absentia of morally corrupting a young person and sentenced to two years in prison.

He was arrested in late July and detained on other charges, including fomenting insurrection, criminally associating with a terrorist body and endangering state security.

He has periodically been on hunger strike since then.","{'uri': 'dailymail.co.uk', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'Daily Mail Online'}",[],https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2023/11/17/14/wire-77932147-1700231037-117_636x382.jpg,eng-9071087,0.1450980392156862,25,25,Daily Mail Online,dailymail.co.uk

Downing Street has ruled out a proposal by rightwing Conservatives to override international law to remove asylum seekers to Rwanda, an idea condemned by a senior centrist Tory as ""dictatorial"".

Rishi Sunak has already pledged to introduce emergency legislation to try to get around Wednesday's supreme court ruling that flights to Rwanda could not take place because of the risk that people could be wrongly returned to their home countries and placed in danger.

With the bill not set to be published until the week after next, Sunak has come under intense pressure to use so-called notwithstanding clauses, a legal mechanism which would state the government could ignore the European convention on human rights (ECHR) and elements of the UN refugee convention placed into UK law.

After Suella Braverman, sacked by Sunak as home secretary on Monday, used a newspaper article to urge the prime minister to take this approach, a former deputy prime minister said this would betray the party's fundamental principles.

""This is the most unconservative proposal I've ever heard,"" Damian Green, who was deputy PM under Theresa May, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. ""You know conservatives believe in a democratic country, run by the rule of law. Dictators like Xi [Jinping] and [Vladimir] Putin would prefer to have the state completely untrammelled by any law.""

Green added: ""Defending the principle that governments have to obey the law is really important for conservatives, perhaps particularly at times of heightened political change.""

Asked if No 10 might consider setting aside the remit of the ECHR and refugee convention, Sunak's spokesperson said this risked seeing the bill mired in delays.

""The right approach is to have a targeted, focused response to the issues that were raised by the supreme court,"" she said. ""Obviously, we have been working and preparing for outcomes for some time, and will now finalise legislation in the light of the specific judgment on Wednesday, but we think that it's right to take this targeted approach, and that is the swiftest way to get flights off the ground.

""We're mindful that a broader, more complex approach does come with the potential for this to take longer. Our priority is stopping the boats and getting the Rwanda partnership up and running and flights off the ground, and we think that our targeted approach, which responds specifically to the issues raised by the supreme court, is the swiftest way to achieve that.""

Braverman's article in the Daily Telegraph set out a five-point plan she argued would make sure flights would leave by spring, Sunak's target, and help reduce the numbers of asylum seekers arriving unofficially in the UK on small boats across the Channel.

As well as using notwithstanding clauses in the law, she said the UK should work more closely with Rwanda to guarantee the treatment of asylum seekers, that those who arrive on boats should be detained and deported within days, and finally that parliament should sit over Christmas to pass the new laws.

Sunak's spokesperson did not rule out MPs sitting over Christmas, while stressing this was a matter for Commons authorities: ""We're prepared to do whatever is necessary to ensure that we can get this in place and get flights off the ground.""

Sir David Normington, a former permanent secretary at the Home Office, said Braverman's latest ideas on how to revive the Rwanda plan were unworkable.

""One of the things we keep hearing, and this is Suella Braverman's latest idea, is that we should remove all appeals, that we should close off all routes,"" he said on Friday. ""I really don't think that that is possible. I think in the end, the supreme court wouldn't allow that.""

Following controversy over a description of sleeping rough as a ""lifestyle choice"", and a public row with the Metropolitan police over pro-Gaza ceasefire protests, Braverman was finally sacked for writing a newspaper article not authorised by No 10.

She has continued to cause problems for Sunak, writing a public letter accusing him of being weak and reneging on promises he made to her during his leadership campaign.","{'uri': 'theguardian.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","[{'uri': 'peter_walker@theguardian.com', 'name': 'Peter Walker', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': False}, {'uri': 'kiran_stacey@theguardian.com', 'name': 'Kiran Stacey', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': False}]",https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/840296c4e22de26778846088d42ee70dcb06fa80/7_58_2513_1508/master/2513.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&s=96641c3808011c23b62e5e6d224cc2b8,eng-9063836,-0.2627450980392156,25,25,The Guardian,theguardian.com

Alison Battisson, the director of Human Rights For All, and David Manne, the executive director of Refugee Legal, have both warned the changes may amount to ""extrajudicial"" punishment.

On Thursday parliament passed a bill imposing conditions, including electronic monitoring and curfews, to bridging visas issued to those who are required to be released due to the high court's ruling on indefinite detention. It creates criminal penalties for their breach, including a mandatory minimum sentence of one year in prison, with each day of breach considered a separate offence.

Battisson, who acts for people in detention and was one of the first to demand her clients be released as a result of the high court decision, said there are ""definite concerns"" with the new regime.

""There would appear prima facie grounds to challenge because the conditions are disproportionate to any risk,"" she told Guardian Australia.

'They are unnecessary because the criminal justice system has all those checks and balances,"" she said, citing risk assessments conducted at sentencing and parole.

""Extrajudicial punishment is likely unconstitutional. I'm very confident someone will bring claim.

""It's so obviously challengeable,"" she said. ""That's why they should've waited for the high court's full reasons - you don't rush through legislation like this.""

Manne said the new laws ""impose such severe restrictions on fundamental rights and liberties that you cannot rule out the possibility of a future legal challenges"". ""There is every chance.""

He said the laws create ""extraordinary extrajudicial powers akin to anti-terrorism control orders to, in effect, further deprive people of their liberty when the high court have just ruled against deprivation of their liberty"".

""What we're seeing here is serious government overreach - [legislating] powers that would ordinarily only be determined by a court.""

The Human Rights Law Centre's acting legal director, Sanmati Verma, suggested while challenges ""are available"" they may be practically difficult for the cohort of 84 people released from detention so far.

""The people who might have been able to bring one are so thoroughly demonised, it is difficult to see how a challenge could be immediately brought,"" she said. ""Nevertheless, there are serious legal problems with the legislation and regulations.""

In Senate debate on Thursday, Labor's Murray Watt rejected the Greens contention that the conditions amounted to imprisonment because the bill states curfews can only be eight hours at a time.

Watt acknowledged Coalition amendments, accepted by the government, ""add constitutional risk"". He said the government believes they are lawful, but there may need to be ""adjustments"" after the high court's reasons.

On Friday the shadow home affairs minister, James Paterson, revealed that despite Labor agreeing in principle to mandatory electronic monitoring and curfews, this had been watered down to a strong presumption for those conditions.

Paterson told Sky News the government had received legal advice if these were ""mandatory, that might fall foul of the high court's decision, it might be akin to punishment"".

The legislation now states those conditions ""must be imposed unless the minister is satisfied that the holder does not pose a risk to the community"".

Paterson said this is a ""high bar"" and the Coalition expects ""all"" or ""almost all"" the cohort would therefore have electronic monitoring.

The government is also bracing for possible claims for compensation for false imprisonment, which the solicitor general, Stephen Donaghue, told the high court would be ""inevitable"" if the immigration minister lost the case and ""undefendable"" in cases where it conceded the people had been detained while it was impossible to deport them.

After the NZYQ decision, the Australian Human Rights Commission's president, Rosalind Croucher, said ""those still facing indefinite detention are entitled to their freedom"".

""Those detained when they should have been released now have the vindication that their detention was unlawful and may be entitled to restitution.""","{'uri': 'theguardian.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","[{'uri': 'paul_karp@theguardian.com', 'name': 'Paul Karp', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': False}]",https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6b6a34f75bc21c374aa68d17ce4d1406f68c1e76/0_87_5616_3370/master/5616.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&s=e0bfd541c41316417517d34332577702,eng-9062211,-0.2941176470588235,25,25,The Guardian,theguardian.com

The top health official in one of Michigan's largest counties is asking a judge to uphold a $4 million settlement in exchange for her resignation, coming after months of conflict with local conservative leaders who were elected in response to COVID-19 restrictions.

Ottawa County leaders had attempted to fire Adeline Hambley in January after they took majority control of the county's board of commissioners. Finding themselves unable to, the board opted to offer her $4 million -- equivalent to a quarter of the health department's 2024 budget -- in return for her resignation. She also would have had to drop her lawsuit against the county.

The board backed off the offer, saying it was only a ""tentative settlement agreement."" David Kallman, the county's legal counsel, told The Associated Press that ""there has never been an agreement by the board to accept the $4 million. There were discussions.""

MICHIGAN PROPERTY OWNERS NOTCH CRUCIAL LEGAL WIN IN DAM COLLAPSE CASE

But Hambley's lawyer filed a motion Thursday to enforce the settlement, and it's scheduled to go in front of a judge on Nov. 27.

""The parties agreed to settle this matter on Nov. 6, 2023. Now, defendants have remorse and want out of the deal,"" Hambley's lawyer, Sarah Riley-Howard, wrote in the filing.

Public health officials and local health departments across the country became political targets during the pandemic due to lockdowns and restrictions.

Ottawa County's health department serves 300,000 residents in the western part of the state. Earlier this year, county commissioners voted to cut the department's upcoming budget by nearly $4 million. The board had threatened deeper cuts, and Hambley took to social media to protest.

The county's 11-member board of commissioners was transformed last year when eight incumbents were defeated by a slate of challengers tied closely to a group known as Ottawa Impact, which was formed in 2021 partly in response to mask mandates in the county.

Kyle Terpstra, a Republican commissioner, resigned from his position on the board Thursday, just hours after the Hambley lawsuit was filed. He said ""significant changes in my personal and professional life"" led to the resignation.

Hambley sued the commissioners earlier this year for ""termination in violation of public policy."" In October, the state's appeals court ruled Hambley could be fired only for ""just cause.""

But following a nearly eight-hour closed session at a Nov. 6 meeting, commissioners voted to ""accept counsel's recommendation regarding litigation and settlement activities"" regarding Hambley. The settlement was later revealed to be $4 million, in return for Hambley's resignation.

Hambley would work until at least Nov. 30 but no later than Dec. 15 under the agreement.

Nathaniel Kelly, a safety manager at an HVAC company and who has no public health experience, is in line to take over the county health department.

The county requested approval from the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services for Kelly to serve as acting health officer, but the state told the county it couldn't appoint a health officer until a vacancy exists, according to a spokesperson with the department.","{'uri': 'foxnews.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'Fox News'}",[],https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2023/11/Adeline-Hambley-Michigan.gif,eng-9069117,-0.04313725490196074,25,25,Fox News,foxnews.com

Please try again later{{ /verifyErrors }}

Rishi Sunak has denied ""tinkering"" with the Rwanda policy after his sacked former home secretary suggested his plan to save the scheme would fail without more radical measures.

The Prime Minister defended his announcement of emergency legislation and a new treaty with Kigali in a bid to address issues that led the UK's highest court to rule the deal was unlawful.

Speaking to broadcasters during a visit to a school in Bolsover, Mr Sunak insisted he will ""work night and day"" to ensure domestic courts cannot ""systemically"" block flights to the east African nation.

It comes after Suella Braverman, who was ousted during a Cabinet reshuffle this week, claimed the Prime Minister's ""Plan B"" is ""simply a tweaked version of the failed Plan A"".

Asked whether his rescue measures amounted to ""tinkering with plan A... (without) a serious alternative"", he said: ""No, as I said, the progress we've made this year on tackling this issue is meaningful.

""The number of crossings are down by a third this year, because we're co-operating with other countries to crack down on the criminal gangs.""

He added: ""We can pass these laws in Parliament that will give us the powers and the tools we need. Then we can get the flights off and whether it's the House of Lords or the Labour Party standing in our way I will take them on because I want to get this thing done and I want to stop the boats.""

Mr Sunak declined to say whether he would call a general election if the upper chamber blocked the new law, instead insisting it was up to Labour to help it reach the statute books quickly.

""The real question is: is the Labour Party going to stand in the way and stop this from happening, or are they going to work with us and support this Bill so we can get it through as quickly as possible?"" he said.

Sir Keir Starmer later accused the Government of opting to ""blame somebody else for their failure"" as he demanded ministers ""stop pursuing the expensive gimmicks that are just wasting time.""

In a scathing article on Friday, Mrs Braverman claimed a solution to the challenge of stopping migrants crossing the English Channel ""demands of the Government an end to self-deception and spin"".

""Tinkering with a failed plan will not stop the boats,"" she wrote in the Daily Telegraph.

Mr Sunak is facing concerns over the dilemma from both sides of his party, with one-nation Tory Damian Green defending the PM against Mrs Braverman's attack but stressing the importance of observing the rule of law.

""It's not just all our own laws passed by Parliament, and all international treaties that we have signed, that Suella wants to sweep away,"" Mr Green told BBC Radio 4's Today programme.

""Conservatives believe in a democratic country run by the rule of law. And dictators, Xi and Putin, would prefer to have the state completely untrammelled by any law. And so, as a democrat I oppose it.

""But quite specifically as a Conservative, because if we Conservatives don't believe that the state should be controlled by the law, that the Government has to obey the law as much as you or I have to obey the law, then that seems to me to be very profoundly unconservative.""

Meanwhile, Lord Sumption, a former Supreme Court judge, told the BBC the plan to use a law to declare Rwanda as safe was ""profoundly discreditable"", ""constitutionally really quite extraordinary"", and would ""effectively overrule"" a decision by the UK's highest court.

Mr Sunak's two-pronged strategy to dealing with the Supreme Court judgment is to announce an emergency law that he says will enable Parliament to ""unequivocally"" declare Rwanda a safe destination for asylum seekers.

He will also publish an upgraded agreement with the country which is expected to attempt to address the court's concerns around refoulement - the potential for refugees whose applications for asylum are rejected by Kigali to be sent back to the country they are fleeing.

Downing Street did not rule out the prospect of MPs debating the legislation over Christmas after Mrs Braverman suggested Parliament should sit through the festive period to push through the laws.

""I think we are prepared to do whatever is necessary to ensure that we can get this in place and get flights off the ground,"" a No 10 spokeswoman said.

Meanwhile, No 10 has promised the treaty will published in ""the coming days"", but said it could not confirm reports that this will be as soon as Monday.","{'uri': 'independent.co.uk', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'The Independent'}",[],https://static.independent.co.uk/2023/11/17/12/6cbd5874f3f2b8dcadd805921642da2bY29udGVudHNlYXJjaGFwaSwxNzAwMzA3MDA4-2.74574836.jpg?quality=75&width=1200&auto=webp,eng-9063836,-0.01960784313725494,25,25,The Independent,independent.co.uk

What international law says,"Israel's attacks on Gaza's al-Shifa hospital have sparked accusations of war crimes. Israel denies this, saying its operation falls within the boundaries of international law

The Geneva conventions, adopted in the aftermath of the second world war, form the core of international humanitarian law and ""are particularly protective of civilian hospitals"", according to Mathilde Philip-Gay, an expert in international humanitarian law at Lyon 3 University in south-east France.

She said: ""It is forbidden to turn recognised civilian hospitals into a conflict zone. It is also forbidden to use civilian populations, the sick or the injured as human shields, it is a war crime, as is fighting from inside a hospital.""

Article 8 of the Rome statute, which established the international criminal court (ICC) in The Hague, defines a long list of war crimes including ""intentionally directing attacks against buildings dedicated to religion, education, art, science or charitable purposes, historic monuments, hospitals and places where the sick and wounded are collected"".

But it makes an exception if the targets are ""military objectives"". Philip-Gay said that ""if a civilian hospital is used for acts harmful to the enemy, that is the legal term used"", the hospital can lose its protected status under international law and be considered a legitimate target. Nevertheless, if there is doubt as to whether a hospital is a military objective or being used for acts harmful to the enemy, the presumption, under international humanitarian law, is that it is not.

It is widely accepted that Hamas has an extensive tunnel network across Gaza.

Israel is not a member of the ICC, but the ICC says it has jurisdiction in Gaza and the West Bank because Palestine is a state party to the court, a claim disputed by Israel.

Karim Khan, the chief prosecutor at the ICC, wrote in the Guardian: ""For those responsible for targeting and firing missiles, I wish to be clear on three points in particular. One: in relation to every dwelling house, in relation to any school, any hospital, any church, any mosque - those places are protected, unless the protective status has been lost because they are being used for military purposes. Two: if there is a doubt that a civilian object has lost its protective status, the attacker must assume that it is protected. Three: the burden of demonstrating that this protective status is lost rests with those who fire the gun, the missile, or the rocket in question.

""In this context, I would also underline that the indiscriminate firing of rockets from Gaza into Israel may represent breaches of international humanitarian law subject to the jurisdiction of the ICC.""

The United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (UNOCHA), says: ""Any military operation around or within hospitals must take steps to spare and protect the patients, medical staff, and other civilians. All feasible precautions must be taken, including effective warnings, which consider the ability of patients, medical staff, and other civilians to evacuate safely.""

Philip-Gay said: ""The other party must take all precautions to avoid intentionally targeting civilians."" Even if the hospital is used for ""acts harmful to the enemy"", Philip-Gay said, the other party ""does not have the right to bombard it for two days and completely destroy it"", citing the need under international law for the response to be ""proportionate"".

She added that the other party must give advance warning of its response and that evacuation procedures must be put in place for patients and health workers.

Alternatively, they can be asked ""to isolate themselves in a part of the hospital"", she said. But during any military operation against the site, ""there have to be doctors to take care of the patients"", she said.","{'uri': 'theguardian.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'The Guardian'}",[],https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c6242615f68b6fdf534205ab06c20bb9a6581a1e/0_194_5808_3485/master/5808.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&s=b0282fa4a8b0ece3b693bb1eb3ea59db,eng-9070708,-0.6470588235294117,25,25,The Guardian,theguardian.com

A little over a year ago, when she was home secretary in Liz Truss' government, she made it perfectly clear that she thought this central aspect of government policy was incompatible with UK membership of the European Convention on Human Rights. Right or wrong, she was correct and logically consistent.

She said then ""My position personally is that ultimately we do need to leave the European Convention on Human Rights...I don't think we need to be subject to an institution born out of the post-war era which is a bit analogue in the way that it operates, which has centralised power, which is distant and which is politicised, which is pursuing an agenda which is at odds with our politics and our values. I don't think that's the direction that the world is going in, that's not the direction that people called for with Brexit.""

She herself admitted that her personal view wasn't government policy, and she was criticised for breaching cabinet collective responsibility.

Now, although freed from cabinet collective responsibility, Braverman hardly mentions the ECHR in her latest contribution to the debate. In fact, and rather bizarrely, out of government she seems to have moved closer to the official government line than where she was when she was still in the cabinet. Even more curious, not to say unfortunate, is that her article acknowledges that the ECHR can still intervene in refugee deportation cases in the UK. Braverman admits that: ""Even if we won in the domestic court, the saga would simply relocate to Strasbourg where the European court would take its time deciding if it liked our laws.""

So her answer to that is to pass emergency legislation that suspends all application of any British or international law and the English common law, including the ancient doctrine of habeas corpus, simply to send a handful of people to Kigali. Yet if you want to evade international law it would be much better and simpler, as she said before, to opt out of the European and United Nations conventions, rather than trying to make being unlawful lawful, suspending our civil rights and placing the British courts under the control of government.

In the latest Braverman plan, virtually any decision by the Home Office - which in effect means by the home secretary and other ministers - could never be challenged by the courts for its legality. Passing such ""emergency legislation"" would set the terrible precedent of placing politicians - albeit elected and democratically accountable - above the law.

MPs could ask questions and pursue constituents' complaints, but if a minister chose to ignore them, then they could. This is supposed to be limited to ""illegal"" refugees, but who is to say who is a legal or illegal refugee? And who is to stop government passing more laws than exempt politicians from the irksome business to obeying the law?

It is a monstrous idea, even by her own authoritarian standards, but it is also unworkable in the sense that the UK would still be a member of the European and UN conventions, and subject to adverse rulings and possible international sanctions as a result of its drift to a form of light dictatorship - an elected dictatorship, but one where arbitrary decisions by bureaucrats and politicians in power cannot be challenged and tested by citizens via independent courts.

The UK has only ever suspended human rights partially and temporarily in times of wars of survival. The small boats crisis is not an invasion, and the Rwanda plan can only cope with a few hundred anyway - which makes the focus on it absurdly disproportionate. Braverman wants to suspend the rule of law during peacetime and on a permanent basis. Unfortunately, Rishi Sunak seems to want to do much the same thing; he differs only on the extent to which he wants to set himself above the law. We should be clear about how close his actual policy is to Braverman's, even though he fired her.

Of course, none of this will happen now because we are far too near to a general election the government is bound to lose, and these unconstitutional ideas - with no manifesto-based electoral mandate - can and will be challenged in the House of Lords and indeed the courts, while they are still capable of doing so. The European Court of Human Rights (which is not ""the European court"" of the EU, as Braverman sneakily implies) would intervene - ironically demonstrating precisely why we need it.

The danger to liberty remains, however. Imagine a world where, in four or five years' time, Braverman is leader of the opposition and slips some slyly worded commitment into a Conservative manifesto about making decisions by ministers unchallengeable in a court of law, here or abroad.

Braverman's ""National Conservatives"", or Nat Cs, under the vagaries of our electoral system, could claim a mandate on 35 per cent of the vote for placing the judiciary (""lefty lawyers"") under the direct ""democratic"" control of ministers. Permanently. No more ""enemies of the people"". No more judicial reviews. That's how dangerous Braverman is, and that's why she, and those like her, must be kept as far away as possible from power: they don't know how to use it.","{'uri': 'independent.co.uk', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'The Independent'}",[],https://static.independent.co.uk/2023/11/14/17/57a1a0876a20e6ea7017ede2a577ec5fY29udGVudHNlYXJjaGFwaSwxNzAwMDY5OTU5-2.74210096.jpg?quality=75&width=1200&auto=webp,,0.05098039215686279,25,25,The Independent,independent.co.uk

Republicans are scheming to undo it,"Twenty-seven GOP members emphasized in a letter after the 7 November vote they would work to prevent its implementation

Ohio voters overwhelmingly approved a constitutional amendment on 7 November, guaranteeing its citizens the right to abortion access, but a group of rightwing Republican lawmakers is already trying to reverse that result.

The referendum, which Ohioans passed by 57% of votes, established a constitutional right to an abortion, overriding laws passed by the Republican-dominated legislature to dramatically restrict access. In response, 27 GOP members of the Ohio general assembly signed a statement the next day arguing the abortion rights proposal ""failed to mention a single, specific law"", and vowing to ""do everything in [their] power"" to prevent the restrictive abortion laws on the books in Ohio from being challenged.

Four of them went even further, circulating draft legislation to give the legislature ""exclusive authority over implementing"" the constitutional amendment at the exclusion of the courts - a move legal experts have decried as unconstitutional.

""To prevent mischief by pro-abortion courts,"" wrote the four Republican lawmakers in a statement, ""Ohio legislators will consider removing jurisdiction from the judiciary over this ambiguous ballot initiative.""

The move is the latest attempt by some Republicans in the state to use their iron grip on the state legislature to push anti-democratic efforts. The legislature has for years declined to heed a 2015 ballot measure prohibiting partisan gerrymandering and attempted in August to make it harder for voters to directly affect policy through referendums. The latest move goes much further, essentially challenging the authority of the courts and the constitution.

The draft legislation, however, has been rejected even by high-ranking Republicans: the house speaker, Jason Stephens, called it a non-starter and a clear violation of the basic democratic principle of separation of powers. ""This is Schoolhouse Rock-type stuff. We need to make sure that we have the three branches of the government,"" he told reporters on Tuesday.

Mike DeWine, the Republican Ohio governor, also expressed doubts about the bill's chances. ""I don't think the public should start thinking that it is going to become law,"" DeWine said on Monday.

Matt Huffman, the state senate majority leader, who vocally opposed the abortion rights amendment, has yet to weigh in. But he has already floated another alternative: holding another referendum on abortion access to undo the recent decision. Huffman is term-limited and it's widely expected he will run for a seat in the state house of representatives. There's been buzz locally that if he wins, Huffman could challenge Stephens for the speakership. Huffman did not respond to a request for comment.

But just because the Republican proposal isn't likely to be adopted doesn't make it irrelevant. Voting rights advocates and political observers see it as just the latest effort to undermine democracy and cement rightwing policies, even if they're at odds with the majority of Ohio's voters.

""The threat of election subversion is just as powerful as subversion itself, because it erodes trust and makes people question whether or not they want to participate - whether or not their vote will be counted, [and] whether after it's counted, if it will actually be respected,"" said Kayla Griffin, the Ohio state director of the voting rights group All Voting Is Local.

State Republicans ignored a 2015 referendum prohibiting partisan gerrymandering and drew maps that gave Republicans an advantage in both branches of the legislature - they have a supermajority in each - and a lopsided number of congressional seats.

The conservative-leaning state supreme court ruled seven times that the maps violated the constitution, and after every ruling the legislature returned maps to the court without meaningfully changing them. The swing vote on the court retired at the end of 2022, leaving behind a court that will likely side with the GOP and let them preserve their supermajorities in the legislature.

Those maps have given them immense power to do whatever they want with state laws, even if they're unpopular with majorities of Ohioans.

""There is a disconnect between what voters want and what the legislature wants,"" said Catherine Turcer, executive director of Common Cause Ohio. ""It just highlights how gerrymandered the state legislature is.""

This summer, Republicans also tried to weaken the one check voters have on their power by making it dramatically harder to pass a statewide constitutional amendment - specifically targeting the abortion initiative in November. The proposal would have raised the threshold to pass citizen-led ballot measures from a simple majority to 60%. Voters rejected it by a wide margin in August.

Frank LaRose, the Republican secretary of state, who opposed the abortion amendment, then rewrote the ballot language for the November election to include the term ""unborn child"", rather than ""fetus"", a move that opponents criticized as trying to unduly sway voters.

The latest threats by the right wing of the state GOP to suppress the implementation of the constitutional amendment are a marked escalation in that effort.

If Republicans in the state legislature were to pass their proposed legislation challenging the authority of the courts to interpret the constitution, the issue would almost certainly end up disputed in court.

""It really represents an attempt to interfere with the judicial branch,"" said Steven Steinglass, dean emeritus of the Cleveland State University College of Law and the author of The Ohio State Constitution: A Reference Guide. ""It violates the Ohio principles of separation of powers.""

The latest proposal appears too much even for the state's leading Republicans. But it shows how far some elected officials are willing to go to try to force their views on their state - even when it's clear that large majorities of Ohioans disagree.

""This is certainly coming from a far-right faction of the Republican caucus. That said, this faction has gained more and more power,"" said the Ohio Democratic house minority leader, Allison Russo.

Prosecutors said in a filing they were dropping their case against Ara Aprahamian, who had pleaded not guilty in Philadelphia federal court to charges including price-fixing and bid-rigging.

""Dismissal of this case is not contrary to manifest public interest, and it will allow the conservation of this court's time and resources,"" prosecutors said.

They did not explain why the government was dropping the case, which was still in the evidence collection and sharing stage.

The Justice Department declined to comment. A lawyer for Aprahamian, Bob Gage, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Taro in July 2020 agreed to pay more than $200 million to resolve criminal price-fixing allegations amid a broad crackdown by the Justice Department on alleged pricing abuses in the generic drug market.

Taro is now owned by India's Sun Pharmaceutical Industries. A spokesperson for Sun on Thursday did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

In 2020, a former executive of Novartis unit Sandoz, Hector Armando Kellum, pleaded guilty to participating in a scheme to fix prices for generic medicines.

Prosecutors in that case had alleged Aprahamian was one of Kellum's co-conspirators. Kellum agreed to cooperate, prosecutors said.

Kellum's sentencing is set for April 30, 2024, in U.S. District Judge R. Barclay Surrick's court. Attorneys for Kellum did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Thursday.

The case is United States v. Ara Aprahamian, U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania, 2:20-cr-00064-RBS.

Two years later, the case remains open","When Adrian Abelar was shot in the back while face-down on the pavement at a Rosemead auto body shop in October 2021, the consequences were swift for everyone but the L.A. County sheriff's deputy who pulled the trigger.

Abelar, 27, suffered multiple fractured vertebrae and woke up in a hospital bed, court records show. The bullet narrowly missed his spine, according to his lawyer, who said he could have easily been paralyzed or killed.

The shop owner, Richard Doktor, says his business suffered after the sheriff's department released information that made it clear he was the person who called police. The word ""Rat"" can be seen etched in graffiti on the sidewalk outside his shop. Doktor says he's received so many threatening phone calls that employees have quit.

But more than two years later, the question of what, if anything, will happen to Deputy Yen Liu remains unanswered.

The sheriff's department turned over its investigation to L.A. County prosecutors earlier this month. Two officials inside the district attorney's office, who requested anonymity because the case remains open and they are not authorized to discuss it with the media, described the sheriff's probe as taking an unusually long time.

Some officials, the sources said, became concerned when Abelar's civil attorney, Thomas Beck, alerted them to the facts of the case in mid-October and they learned it had yet to be presented for potential prosecution. The office has increasingly filed charges against police officers accused of using excessive force since Dist. Atty. George Gascón took over in 2020.

Liu's case appears to be one of the lengthiest deputy shooting investigations in recent sheriff's department history, according to county records. Since 2013, there were only four other cases in which more than two years elapsed between the shooting and the district attorney's office determining whether charges were warranted, according to a 2021 report by the L.A. County Office of the Inspector General. Such delays, the report said, reduce the chances of a successful prosecution.

""Memories fade and are influenced by exposure to other information,"" the report said. ""Deputies and witnesses inevitably have discussed the details of an event with their colleagues, friends and family, union representatives, attorneys and counselors which affects their memories and perceptions of the events.""

A spokeswoman for the district attorney's office declined to comment.

Sheriff's Dept. Homicide Lt. Michael Gomez said such incidents take time to investigate. ""We have been in communication with the D.A.'s Office throughout the case,"" he said in an email to The Times. ""Our primary objective is to always conduct a thorough and comprehensive investigation to ensure all facts are presented.""

Calls and emails seeking comment from a civil attorney representing Liu were not returned.

Beyond the slow pace of the investigation, the shooting has drawn concerns from use-of-force experts, who question whether it was justified. While Liu's body-worn camera fell off before the bullet was fired, footage captured by another deputy's device clearly shows Abelar unarmed and lying flat on his stomach when Liu fires a single shot into his back at point-blank range.

""The guy clearly does not have a weapon in his hand and the deputy who is on top of him draws his firearm, jams it in the guy's back and fires it immediately upon contact,"" said Ed Obayashi, a lawyer and former Plumas County sheriff's deputy who advises departments throughout California about use-of-force incidents.

In a recent interview, Abelar said he didn't know why sheriff's deputies were approaching his car at J&R Auto on the day of the shooting in 2021. But he knew he was in trouble as soon as he saw badges. Abelar -- who has multiple prior arrests for domestic violence, making threats and weapons offenses -- had failed to check in with his probation officer, and there was a gun in his waistband.

He said he knew it was wrong to be carrying a gun, but he felt he needed to protect himself and his friends.

""I had a lot of people looking for me,"" Abelar said, declining to offer specifics.

The deputies were responding to a call from Doktor, who had claimed Abelar arrived demanding repairs be done on his car quickly because he had an active murder warrant, according to the sheriff's department. No such warrant existed.

Video of the incident released by the sheriff's department shows Abelar having a calm conversation with the responding deputies, during which he lied about being on probation. After a few minutes, Abelar said, he made the decision to run, fearing if the deputies found him with a gun, he'd either go back to prison or they would shoot him. He says he tossed the weapon as soon as he opened the car door. Deputies can be heard on the video yelling ""Gun!"" as he tried to escape.

The body-cam footage shows Abelar diving to the ground. That video, as well as a slowed down version of the clip provided to The Times by his attorney, does not show a gun in Abelar's hands at the moment Liu shoots him. His right arm can be seen outstretched and empty in the video, though his left arm isn't visible.

Deputies recovered a loaded handgun at the scene ""on the ground north of the vehicle,"" according to the sheriff's department report.

Documents turned over by the sheriff's department to prosecutors -- which Beck obtained in discovery in a civil lawsuit he filed this year on Abelar's behalf -- show one internal incident report describing the encounter as an ""assault with a deadly weapon against a peace officer."" Liu is listed among the victims.

None of the deputies alleged Abelar pointed a gun at them, a necessary element for that crime to be charged, according to Beck and the sheriff's department report. One deputy said he didn't even see the weapon until it was recovered. The video also does not show Abelar point the gun at anyone.

An assault case has not been presented against Abelar, according to the district attorney's office. Nicole Nishida, a sheriff's department spokeswoman, said only that the issue of whether or not Abelar had committed an assault was ""being investigated.""

Beck said he believes the deputies were simply looking for a way to cast blame on his client, who he said is lucky to be alive.

""If this bullet had gone one millimeter to the left or one millimeter to the right, he would have been paralyzed, or he would have been dead,"" the attorney said.

During a recent interview in Gloria Molina Grand Park in downtown L.A., Abelar's leg began to shake as an LAPD cruiser went by. Already unnerved by police, now he says his ""anxiety goes up"" whenever he sees an officer or deputy. He said he hasn't worked since the shooting and his back constantly hurts.

Abelar said he went to J&R Auto that day because he had a problem with his brakes and Doktor -- the shop owner known in the neighborhood by the nickname ""Brooklyn"" -- was a family friend.

But Doktor, a 63-year-old with an unmistakable New York accent, called the sheriff's department's Temple station directly asking deputies to get Abelar ""off his property,"" according to recordings made public by law enforcement. In the call, Doktor described Abelar as ""inked from head to toe"" and demanding car repairs because he was fleeing from the cops due to an active murder warrant.

Doktor told The Times this week that Abelar drove into the auto body shop's parking lot at a high rate of speed, ""waved a gun around"" and pointed it at two of Doktor's mechanics, insisting he had just been involved in a shooting in Alhambra.

Abelar denies all of Doktor's accusations. He was not wanted for murder at the time of the shooting, according to the sheriff's department, though Abelar did have an active warrant for a probation violation. None of Doktor's allegations concerning Abelar threatening people with a gun or claiming to have shot someone are reflected in the sheriff's department's report on the incident.

Doktor said Abelar's actions were captured by surveillance cameras at his auto body shop, but that the sheriff's department took that footage from him the day of the shooting. When they returned the files, Doktor said, the videos were unplayable. Doktor also could not point The Times to any other employees who would corroborate his allegations.

The mechanic stood by his version of events, but also said the deputies were in the wrong for shooting Abelar.

""That kid was no threat,"" he said of the shooting, adding that he screamed at deputies on scene for opening fire and that he saw Abelar throw the gun away.

Doktor says his business has been ""in the toilet"" since the shooting, in part because the sheriff's department described him as an ""informant"" in their videos detailing the incident. While the sheriff's department didn't release his name, his voice is easily recognizable. Doktor said some regular customers moved on out of fear that the violent incident that day would be repeated. Others have fled due to the threats.

In addition to the ""rat"" graffiti outside his shop, Doktor says he's found dead rodents and bullets thrown over the fence. Several mechanics have quit, he said.

Nishida said no such threats have been reported to the sheriff's department's Temple station, which patrols the area where the shop is located, and refuted Doktor's complaints about the video footage.

""No video footage was destroyed or erased,"" she said. ""Homicide investigators only made a digital copy of what was on the surveillance equipment and returned it.""

Beck said he considers Doktor an ""unreliable"" witness and still has no idea why the investigation into the shooting has taken so long. The civil lawsuit against the sheriff's department is pending. The county has denied all wrongdoing in legal filings and a trial date is set for next March.

The sheriff's department's report only lists six witnesses to the incident -- the three responding deputies, Doktor, Abelar and Abelar's ex-girlfriend -- and the confrontation itself was brief and captured on camera, the lawyer said.

""They had to know this was a bad shooting,"" Beck said. ""The best way to deal with it was to suppress it.""","{'uri': 'latimes.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'Los Angeles Times'}",[],https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/6a8f653/2147483647/strip/true/crop/7964x4480+0+416/resize/1200x675!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F3d%2Fb3%2Febd881c04872ab9d3cb2251e9d26%2F1369556-me-adrian-abelar-shooting-147.jpg,,-0.2235294117647059,25,25,Los Angeles Times,latimes.com

SMITH / AFP via Getty Images

The American Civil Liberties Union challenged Florida's ban on pro-Palestinian university groups, arguing in a federal lawsuit on Thursday that the state is violating students' free speech as tensions roil U.S. campuses over Israel's war with Hamas.

Florida's university system, joined by Governor Ron DeSantis, last month ordered colleges to shut down chapters of Students for Justice in Palestine (SJP), a group at the center of U.S. campus activism since Hamas attacked Israel on Oct. 7.

The lawsuit -- against DeSantis, a 2024 Republican presidential hopeful, and several state university system officials -- was filed on behalf of the University of Florida's SJP chapter and seeks a preliminary injunction to a state order blocking SJP from receiving school funds and using campus facilities.

""If Florida officials think silencing pro-Palestinian students protects the Jewish community -- or anyone, they're wrong. This attack on free speech is dangerous,"" Howard Simon, interim executive director of ACLU of Florida, said in a statement.

A spokesperson for DeSantis said the governor was right to disband the groups.

""Groups that claim to be part of a foreign terrorist movement have no place on our university campuses,"" governor spokesperson Jeremy Redfern said.

State University System of Florida Chancellor Ray Rodrigues did not respond to a request for comment.

Students at U.S. universities have clashed over issues emerging on both sides of the nearly six-week-old conflict. Some accuse their schools of not doing enough to denounce antisemitism and others that the schools ignore the plight of Gazans under Israeli fire.

The lawsuit, filed in U.S. District Court in Florida by the ACLU, ACLU of Florida and Palestine Legal, cites a Supreme Court decision affirming students' right to associate and speak out on matters of public concern, and another case establishing that federal law does not criminalize ""independent political advocacy"" as long as it is not done in coordination with, or at the direction of, foreign terrorist groups.

Brandeis University has also banned SJP indefinitely, and Columbia University and George Washington University have suspended the group. The schools have cited the national organization's support for the Hamas attack and said their campus chapters violated school policies.

The student groups call the suspensions and bans unjust. Videos posted to Instagram have shown Palestinian supporters rallying at Columbia and George Washington on Wednesday in protest over the SJP groups' suspensions.

Florida's university system has said it based its ban on a ""toolkit"" issued by the national organization to chapters that referred to Hamas' attack as ""the resistance"" and stated ""Palestinian students in exile are PART of this movement.""

In his Oct. 24 memo ordering the ban, Chancellor Rodrigues said the national SJP identified itself as part of Hamas' attack and that it was a felony under Florida law ""to provide material support... to a designated foreign terrorist organization.""

Brian Hauss, senior staff attorney with the ACLU Speech, Privacy and Technology project and counsel in the case, said the student plaintiffs in the state university system were victims of ""guilt by association"" in this case.

""They are a completely autonomous and independent group that is in no way beholden to the national Students for Justice in Palestine,"" Hauss said in an interview, adding that he did not believe the national organization could be found criminally liable for its statements about Hamas.

Israel says Hamas killed 1,200 people in the Oct. 7 assault and took about 240 hostages to Gaza. Gaza health authorities say more than 11,000 people have been confirmed killed in Israel's counteroffensive in Gaza.","{'uri': 'nbcnews.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'NBC News'}",[],"https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_nbcnews-fp-1024-512,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2023-11/231117-gaza-protest-ny-1052-6f09b0.jpg",eng-9068745,-0.2392156862745098,25,25,NBC News,nbcnews.com

His sister Annette Mattia, 61, was just yards away in her own house the night of May 18. Five months later, she choked down tears while standing near the spot where he lay.

""This is where he lived, and it just is sadness and anger because it didn't have to happen at all,"" she said. ""If they would have talked to him it would have turned out a lot different because you know he wasn't a threat.""

""He didn't deserve to die like this,"" her daughter Yvonne Nevarez, 43, added.

Now, the family wants justice.

""To me it feels like there are still murderers walking around. Who knows they might be back out here again? Who knows what they might do to anyone else?"" Annette Mattia said in an interview outside her home.

The family, several of whom live on a compound in Menagers Dam Village within the Tohono O'odham Nation, believe that the agents ruthlessly gunned a man down with scant regard for his constitutional rights. But federal prosecutors have already said there will be no criminal charges.

A recent Supreme Court ruling means any effort to sue the agents individually for alleged constitutional violations is doomed to fail. The 2022 ruling is one in a line of cases that has decimated the ability of victims to file lawsuits, known as ""Bivens claims,"" accusing Border Patrol agents of using excessive force or other constitutional violations.

The court's dismantling of Bivens has reverberated throughout the federal government and touched nearly every agency, but Border Patrol represents a large fraction of armed federal law enforcement and the geography of their jurisdiction presents a uniquely thorny set of legal questions.

The court, in a case called Egbert v. Boule that involved a claim against a Border Patrol agent, introduced a new legal test that makes it virtually impossible to bring a wide range of claims against federal officials.

And so the Mattia family is far from alone.

In the aftermath of the ruling, lawsuits alleging a wide range of constitutional violations are now routinely tossed out. People mistreated by federal officials aren't getting their day in court, instead being denied the chance to find out if a jury would agree that their constitutional rights were violated. The court has also made it harder to sue government officials by continually strengthening the legal defense known as qualified immunity -- a point that drew the direct ire of protesters during the rise of the Black Lives Matter movement in 2020 in the wake of the police killing of George Floyd.

In the 12 months after Egbert, lower courts cited it 228 times in a range of cases against all kinds of federal officials, according to an NBC News search using the LexisNexis legal database. In 195 of those cases, constitutional claims were dismissed.

Also in the year after the Egbert ruling, judges tossed more than a dozen lawsuits in which Customs and Border Protection (CBP), which Border Patrol is part of, or Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officers were defendants accused of violating constitutional rights.

Among the 15 out of 16 claims dismissed:

Even when a federal employee at the Department of Homeland Security sued officials in the department for malicious prosecution after being accused of falsifying documents, a judge dismissed the claim partly on the grounds that, in line with Egbert, ""regulating the conduct of immigration agents similarly risks judicial intrusion into national security.""

Some plaintiffs gave up in light of the Egbert decision. Abdulkadir Nur, a Somali American Muslim, who said he was harassed by border protection agents at the airport every time he entered the country, withdrew his Bivens claim after the ruling was issued.

""It's been predictably a nightmare. We have had to voluntarily dismiss Bivens claims in most of our cases,"" said Justin Sadowsky, a lawyer with the legal arm of the Council on American-Islamic Relations, which represents Nur.

The message to federal officers accused of misdeeds is clear: You won't face lawsuits for your actions.

Without individual accountability, wrongdoers are protected and unconstitutional practices can quickly become normalized among sprawling federal agencies like the Border Patrol, civil rights advocates say.

The plight facing Mattia's family puts the spotlight on how the Supreme Court ruling affects the U.S.-Mexico border, an area many already view as a lawless hinterland where constitutional rights are not respected.

""The court's opinion in Egbert is unequivocal that there is no damages action available against any Border Patrol agent for any reason,"" including over what happened to Mattia, said Patrick Jaicomo, a lawyer with the libertarian-leaning Institute for Justice.

Lawyers for the Mattia family plan to pursue a wrongful death claim against the federal government, with an announcement scheduled for Friday, the details of which were exclusively shared with NBC News. And while the lawyers say they are not yet completely ruling out bringing a lawsuit alleging constitutional violations against the officers themselves, they concede that they would be facing extremely long odds.

""It makes it very, very difficult to hold the individual officers accountable in front of a jury,"" lawyer Timothy Scott said of the Egbert ruling.

The agents handcuffed him, blood soaking through his jacket.

""Where's the firearm?"" an agent asked.

Another tended to his wounds: ""Keep breathing, bro,"" he said.

The agents encountered Mattia at 9:39 p.m. He was pronounced dead at 10:06 p.m.

Whether the officers were looking for Mattia that night, or knew him before, remains unclear. His story is complicated. A toxicology report indicated he had alcohol, methamphetamine and oxycodone in his system at the time of death. He had a criminal record that included a conviction for a sex offense decades ago.

For Annette Mattia, learning about the recent Supreme Court ruling feels like insult added to injury after what happened to her brother.

""They know they're going to get away with it,"" she said. ""We're not going to get justice.""","{'uri': 'nbcnews.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'NBC News'}",[],"https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_nbcnews-fp-1024-512,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2023-11/231115-border-patrol-shooting-mexico-reservation-2x1-cs-56cd6d.jpg",eng-9072260,-0.09019607843137256,25,25,NBC News,nbcnews.com

Mark Harper was unable to say whether the UK should be prepared to leave the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) but said ministers would do ""what it takes"" to send asylum seekers to Kigali including through ""change"" to international agreements.

The Prime Minister has announced plans for emergency legislation and a new treaty with the east African nation in a bid to address issues that led the UK's highest court to rule the policy was unlawful.

A Government source said the upgraded deal with Rwanda would be published ""shortly"" but perhaps not as soon as Monday, as reports earlier suggested.

Speaking to Sky News on Friday, Transport Secretary Mr Harper said: ""We're confident (the measures) will enable us to send people to Rwanda.""

The minister was asked about the latest intervention from Suella Braverman, who claimed in an article for The Telegraph that the policy would fail unless the PM is more radical.

""The point is we do need to make changes to the legal position. That is why on Wednesday immediately after the Supreme Court judgment the Prime Minister set out two things,"" he said.

""First of all we are concluding a new treaty with Rwanda. We weren't sitting on our hands when the Supreme Court was considering this case. We were already working on contingencies depending on what they set out.""

He added: ""That will make the position very clear for the courts and we are confident that that will enable us to send people to Rwanda to break the business model of these organised crime groups which is what the British people want us to do.""

Asked on LBC later whether he would be happy for Parliament to sit through Christmas in order to get the emergency legislation on the statute books as soon as possible, he said: ""Well, I'm very happy to do whatever it takes to deliver our commitment, but scheduling parliamentary business is not a matter for me. But I'm prepared to do what it takes to deliver our commitments to the British people.""

Transport Secretary Mark Harper defended the Rwanda plan (Stefan Rousseau/PA)

Mrs Braverman, who was fired in a reshuffle earlier this week, said a solution to the challenge of stopping migrants crossing the English Channel ""demands of the Government an end to self-deception and spin"".

""Tinkering with a failed plan will not stop the boats,"" she wrote in The Telegraph.

Former deputy prime minister Damian Green said that her proposal to pass a law that would block Rwanda deportation appeals is ""profoundly unconservative"".

He said that it would ""sweep away"" all judicial review protection for asylum seekers.

""It's not just all our own laws passed by Parliament, and all international treaties that we have signed, that Suella wants to sweep away,"" he said.

""Conservatives believe in a democratic country run by the rule of law. And dictators, Xi and Putin, would prefer to have the state completely untrammelled by any law. And so, as a democrat I oppose it.

""But quite specifically as a conservative, because if we conservatives don't believe that the state should be controlled by the law, that the Government has to obey the law as much as you or I have to obey the law, then that seems to me to be very profoundly unconservative.""

Meanwhile, Lord Sumption, a former Supreme Court judge, told the BBC the plan to use a law to declare Rwanda as safe was ""profoundly discreditable,"" ""constitutionally really quite extraordinary"" and would ""effectively overrule"" a decision by the UK's highest court.

The yet-to-be-published treaty with Rwanda is expected to attempt to address the Supreme Court's concerns around refoulement - the potential for refugees whose applications for asylum are rejected by Kigali to be sent back to the country they are fleeing from.

Mrs Braverman, who was sacked in a reshuffle this week, said Mr Sunak's ""tinkering"" of the plans to overcome the Supreme Court's verdict that it was unlawful would ""culminate in yet another defeat"" for the government.

Writing in The Telegraph, she said the prime minister's proposals would likely get bogged down in the domestic and European court system.

She has proposed introducing emergency legislation to amend the Illegal Migration Act that should meet five key tests. We take a look at those points below:

Ms Braverman said the government must tackle the issues raised by the five senior judges about Rwanda's asylum and legal system. It can do this by ""embedding UK observers and independent reviewers of asylum decisions"".

These commitments should then be ""embodied in an amended memorandum or a new treaty"" which would ensure that ""Rwanda's safety could be credibly confirmed"".

The former home secretary said that any amendments must exclude ""all avenues of legal challenge"".

Any of the UK's domestic or international obligations - for example, the European Convention on Human Rights - need to be made invalid using ""notwithstanding clauses"". Common law challenges or Judicial Review must also be ""expressly excluded"".

She added: ""Individuals would, however, be given the chance to demonstrate that they had entered the country legally, were under 18, or were medically unfit to fly - but Home Office decisions on these claims could not be challenged in court.""

Ms Braverman said those who arrive on small boats across the channel should be removed ""in a matter of days rather than months"".

This means that migrants due to be moved to Rwanda are mandated ""under the duty to remove, with strict time limits"" which will have the benefit of streamlining the process for the Home Office.

Ms Braverman said that ""any legal challenges to detention must be excluded to avoid burdening the courts, making it clear that detention is mandated until removal.""

The MP for Fareham said any changes ""should be introduced by Christmas recess and parliament should be recalled to sit and debate it over the holiday period.""","{'uri': 'independent.co.uk', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'The Independent'}",[],https://static.independent.co.uk/2023/11/15/16/41b6930987befa036c57fa3da0cff035Y29udGVudHNlYXJjaGFwaSwxNzAwMTUxMjk0-2.74216771.jpg?quality=75&width=1200&auto=webp,eng-9063836,0.003921568627450966,25,25,The Independent,independent.co.uk

Judge David Friedman of the state's intermediate appeals court issued what's known as a stay -- suspending the gag order and allowing the former president to speak freely about court staff while a longer appeals process plays out.

The trial judge, Arthur Engoron, imposed the gag order Oct. 3 after Trump posted a false comment about the judge's law clerk to social media on the second day of the trial in New York Atty. Gen. Letitia James' lawsuit. James alleges that Trump exaggerated his wealth on financial statements used to secure loans and make deals.

Engoron later fined Trump $15,000 for violating the gag order and expanded it to include his lawyers after they questioned clerk Allison Greenfield's prominent role on the bench, where she sits alongside the judge, exchanging notes and advising him during testimony. Friedman's ruling allows the lawyers to again comment about court staff.

At an emergency hearing Thursday, Friedman questioned Engoron's authority to police what Trump says outside the courtroom. He also disputed the trial judge's contention that restricting the 2024 Republican front-runner's speech was necessary or the right remedy to protect his staff's safety.

""Considering the constitutional and statutory rights at issue, an interim stay is granted,"" Friedman said, announcing his decision as he scribbled it on a court order.

The appellate court intervened after Trump's lawyers filed a lawsuit against Engoron late Wednesday that challenged his gag order as an abuse of power. They sued the judge under a state law known as Article 78, which allows lawsuits over some judicial decisions.

Trump and his lawyers have been increasingly frustrated with Engoron presiding over the non-jury trial in James' lawsuit. Trump, angered by a pretrial fraud ruling imperiling his real estate empire, has called him an ""extremely hostile"" judge. His lawyers Wednesday asked for a mistrial, citing evidence of ""tangible and overwhelming"" bias.

Trump and his lawyers have repeatedly criticized Greenfield, contending that the former judicial candidate is a partisan voice in Engoron's ear. Both Greenfield and Engoron are Democrats.

Engoron did not address the gag order ruling in court Thursday afternoon. Regarding the mistrial motion, he gave James' office until Dec. 8 to respond before he rules.

Several of Trump's lawyers and state lawyers from James' office left the Manhattan trial to attend the emergency hearing at a state appellate courthouse a couple miles away. They sat around a table in a conference room and argued for about 45 minutes before Friedman ruled.

Trump lawyer Christopher Kise lauded the temporary stay as the ""right decision.""

Friedman has ""allowed President Trump to take full advantage of his constitutional 1st Amendment rights to talk about bias in his own trial, what he's seeing and witnessing in his own trial -- which, frankly, everyone needs to see,"" Kise said.

Trump didn't wait long to lash out at Greenfield, calling her a ""politically biased and out of control, Trump Hating Clerk"" in a post to his Truth Social platform Thursday night.

Trump lawyer Alina Habba said she saw no reason to tell Trump to stay quiet about the clerk, telling reporters that James ""is continuing to disparage"" her client and that ""both sides need to be able to speak.""

State lawyers and a court system lawyer representing Engoron urged the appellate judge to keep the gag order in place. They argued that the trial judge had taken a reasonable step to protect his staff amid increased threats to their safety.

Engoron and his staff have received hundreds of threatening and antisemitic phone calls and letters since the trial began Oct. 2, court system lawyer Lisa Evans said. She blamed Trump's comments about Engoron and Greenfield for amplifying his supporters' anger toward them. Greenfield is ""playing Whac-A-Mole now trying to block her number,"" Evans said.

""It's not that Mr. Trump has directly issued threats to the staff and Judge Engoron; it's that what he's said has led his constituents"" to make threats, Evans argued, comparing the potential effect to the Jan. 6 capitol riot and a violent attack on Rep. Nancy Pelosi's husband, Paul.

""That is not political speech. That is threatening behavior and it should be stopped,"" Evans said.

Kise suggested the safety concerns were overblown, arguing that Engoron was using the guise of threats -- and the ""hobgoblins of 'Trump's a bad person and he says bad things'"" -- to keep the former president and his lawyers from questioning Greenfield's influence on the trial.

Trump hasn't threatened Greenfield, nor has he disclosed any personal information such as her home address, Kise said. Meanwhile, he noted, she's routinely photographed sitting next to Engoron by media photographers and videographers covering the trial.

State lawyer Daniel Magy argued that Trump's immense social media audience had made the clerk more of a target for threats. Trump's offending social media post was based on a post by someone else who was followed by just a handful of people.

Both posts included a picture that Greenfield had publicly posted online of her with Senate Majority Leader Charles E. Schumer, but Trump added a falsehood about her personal life before sending it off to his millions of followers.","{'uri': 'latimes.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'Los Angeles Times'}",[],https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/9709efc/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3676x2068+0+192/resize/1200x675!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F1e%2F6b%2F0356fa759b469a7d37cd0bd46a76%2Fe648123a7de74b1eab5ad0454e7406e9,eng-9065743,-0.1215686274509804,25,25,Los Angeles Times,latimes.com

A former deputy prime minister and Conservative MP has attacked Suella Braverman's latest plan to send asylum seekers to Rwanda as ""unconservative"" and ""dictatorial"", as the former home secretary continues to divide her party with her outspoken interventions.

Damian Green, who also served as an immigration minister, said on Friday that Braverman's proposal to pass a law to get around the legal obstacles to the Rwanda plan identified earlier this week by the supreme court would be ""the most unconservative proposal I've ever heard"".

Green was responding to an article by the former home secretary in Friday's Telegraph, in which she suggested parliament should pass a new emergency law to override several pieces of domestic and international legislation. The article is the former home secretary's latest intervention as part of what allies say will be a ""grid of shit"" for the government following her dismissal on Monday.

Green told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""This is the most unconservative proposal I've ever heard. You know conservatives believe in a democratic country, run by the rule of law. Dictators like Xi [Jinping] and [Vladimir] Putin would prefer to have the state completely untrammelled by any law.""

He added: ""Defending the principle that governments have to obey the law is really important for conservatives, perhaps particularly at times of heightened political change.""

Braverman used the Telegraph article on Friday to call for a five-point plan to get the government's long-delayed plan to deport asylum seekers to Rwanda off the ground, following the supreme court ruling on Wednesday that it is unlawful.

She argued firstly that the government should agree measures with Rwanda to ensure that refugees do not get sent back to their countries of origin.

Secondly she said MPs should pass a new law to override the European convention on human rights, the Human Rights Act and any other relevant piece of legislation.

Third, she argued asylum seekers should be deported within days of arrival.

She said new arrivals should be detained until deportation and that parliament should sit over Christmas to pass the new laws.

The article is the latest in a series of public statements from Braverman which have caused a headache for the prime minister, Rishi Sunak.

Two weeks ago she defended a plan to restrict the use of tents by homeless people, saying that sleeping rough was a ""lifestyle choice"". She then engaged in a public row with the head of the Metropolitan police, Sir Mark Rowley, over whether he should ban a pro-Palestine march on Armistice Day. That culminated in a piece for the Times in which she accused the police of being biased in the way they handle public demonstrations.

Sunak finally sacked her as home secretary on Monday but she has continued to cause problems for him, writing a public letter accusing him of being weak and reneging on promises he made to her during his leadership campaign.

Sir David Normington, a former permanent secretary at the Home Office, said Braverman's latest ideas on how to revive the Rwanda plan were unworkable.

""One of the things we keep hearing, and this is Suella Braverman's latest idea, is that we should remove all appeals, that we should close off all routes,"" he said on Friday.

""I really don't think that that is possible. I think in the end the supreme court wouldn't allow that.""

Allies of the former home secretary say she will make more public statements in the coming days, as critics accuse her of preparing the ground for a leadership bid should the Conservatives lose the next election.

They have also defended her latest proposals, saying they constitute the best way to meet the prime minister's pledge to stop small boats crossing the Channel.

Sir Simon Clarke, a former cabinet minister, told the BBC: ""I'm in favour of doing what is required to make this policy deliverable. And I think that the point at this stage is that it is for the government now to set out why what Suella is saying is not required in order to make sure that flights can leave for Rwanda.""","{'uri': 'theguardian.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","[{'uri': 'kiran_stacey@theguardian.com', 'name': 'Kiran Stacey', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': False}]",https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/70c279bc0814600b7ee87be40d053fb17d0b6c66/0_58_3000_1801/master/3000.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&s=b047205706e01fb291f314917c51fd77,eng-9063836,-0.03529411764705881,25,25,The Guardian,theguardian.com

The ousted ex-Home Secretary tore apart the PM's plan B for deportation flights.

Writing in The Telegraph she said proposals to strike a new treaty with Rwanda in order to alleviate the concerns of Supreme Court judges won't solve the ""fundamental issues"" with the scheme.

She welcomed Mr Sunak's desire to ""introduce emergency legislation"" but added that for this to happen ""parliament needs to amend the Illegal Migration Act"" .

Ms Braverman announced a five point plan for getting flights off the tarmac.

First, the Bill must address the Supreme Court's concerns about Rwanda being unsafe.

Second, it must contain a clause legislating for flights to take off before the next election.

Third, those arriving illegally must be removed in a matter of days rather than months.

Fourth, legal challenges to detention must be excluded to avoid burdening the courts.

Finally, the Bill should be introduced before Christmas and Parliament should be recalled to debate over the festive season.

Ms Braverman said: ""Now is not the time to waste energy on a post-mortem of how we got here.

""What matters for those of us who believe in effective immigration control is how to move forward.

""This requires honesty.

""There is no longer any chance of stopping the boats within the current legal framework.

""Having committed to emergency legislation, the Prime Minister must now give Parliamentarians a clear choice: to either properly control illegal migration, or explain to the British people why they are powerless under international law and must simply accept ever greater numbers of illegal arrivals on these shores.""

Ms Braverman's intervention comes as her successor James Cleverly yesterday insisted a fresh Rwanda treaty will be done ""in days"".

The new Home Secretary said he was ""absolutely determined"" to get flights off before the next election despite the Supreme Court tearing the plan to shreds.

He also said he did not ""recognise"" claims that he once privately branded the migration policy as ""bats***"".

He said the treaty - which will ensure no asylum seeker can be deported from Rwanda to a potentially unsafe place - within ""matter of days"".

But there are fears even once ratified by MPs it will get bunged up in the Lords and the courts once again - putting paid to the PM's hopes of getting flights by the spring.

Former Supreme Court Justice Lord Sumption criticised the move to have a second crack as ""constitutionally extraordinary"".

The European Union has become the first international body to criminalise widescale environmental damage ""comparable to ecocide"".

Late on Thursday, lawmakers agreed an update to the bloc's environmental crime directive punishing the most serious cases of ecosystem destruction, including habitat loss and illegal logging, with tougher penalties.

Marie Toussaint, a French lawyer and MEP spearheading EU efforts to criminalise ecocide, said the move ""marks the end of impunity for environmental criminals"" and could usher in a new age of environmental litigation in Europe.

The environmental crime directive will be formally passed in the spring, and member states will then have two years to put it into national law.

Although the agreed text does not itself include the actual word ""ecocide"", its preamble says it intends to criminalise ""cases comparable to ecocide"". These are actions that cause widespread, substantial and irreversible or long-lasting damage to large or important ecosystems, habitats or the quality of air, soil or water.

This closely follows a definition of ecocide developed by an international panel of legal experts in 2021. The definition was mainly intended to be adopted by the international criminal court through an amendment to the Rome statute - the key goal of the Stop Ecocide Foundation - but is now increasingly being used for national-level legislation. Scotland, for example, recently began consulting on whether to introduce the UK's first ecocide law.

The revised EU law specifies which kinds of environmental activities are covered. These include water abstraction, ship recycling and pollution, the introduction and spread of invasive alien species, and ozone destruction. But it does not say anything about fishing, the export of toxic waste to developing countries or carbon market fraud.

Having a permit to carry out listed activities will not automatically be an excuse. Individuals and companies will have committed a crime if that authorisation was obtained fraudulently or by corruption, extortion or coercion, or if it breaches substantive legal requirements.

Lawmakers did not agree to extend these obligations to offences committed outside EU borders on behalf of EU companies, but individual member states would be able to choose to do this themselves.

The law introduces new penalties, ranging from prison sentences for individuals to exclusion from access to public funds for companies. Member states will also be able to choose whether to introduce fines for companies based on a proportion of their turnover (up to 5% depending on the crime) or fixed amounts of up to €40m (£35m).

Virginijus Sinkevičius, EU commissioner for environment, oceans and fisheries, said environmental crimes are serious, lucrative and on the rise. Annual revenues from the illegal waste market in the EU, for example, range between €4 and €15bn.

""The EU agreed a new law that recognises their gravity, especially when large ecosystems are destroyed,"" said Sinkevičius. ""Our health depends on the state of the environment in which we live, so we must deter criminals willing to destroy ecosystems for profit.""

Toussaint said the EU had now adopted some of the most ambitious legislation in the world. ""In the European political context, this text is a point of support for all those who defend the environment in court and fight the impunity of criminal firms who too often flout the laws and work today to unravelling environmental democracy in Europe.""

The agreement followed months of negotiation between the European Council, commission and parliament, as well as active civil society campaigning.

Jojo Mehta, co-founder and executive director of Stop Ecocide International, said the updated law would genuinely help member states take environmental harms much more seriously. ""This is highly significant and to be wholeheartedly commended, and we can see from the rapidly growing momentum of the ecocide law initiative that European states will not be long in engaging more deeply with it in their own jurisdictions.""

""Indeed, I have no doubt that with this direction of travel being rapidly established, it is only a matter of time before ecocide is recognised in criminal law at every level.""","{'uri': 'theguardian.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'The Guardian'}",[],https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/11294fe9a91fbf7801fa61ca3c0272033715d796/0_1_3168_1901/master/3168.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&s=6ff760284649ee2d68491b2709d5f734,,-0.3803921568627451,25,25,The Guardian,theguardian.com

The extraordinary in-fighting came after the ex-Home Secretary suggested introducing emergency powers to exclude ""all avenues of legal challenge"" in a bid to get flights off the ground.

Hitting out at her comments the Tory MP Damian Green said it was the ""most unconservative statement I have ever heard from a Conservative politician"". He added: ""Giving the state explicit power to override every legal constraint is what [Vladimir] Putin and Xi [Jinping] do. We absolutely cannot go there"".

Speaking on BBC Radio 4's Today programme, he added: ""Conservatives believe in a democratic country run by the rule of law and dictators - Xi and Putin - would prefer to have the state completely untrammelled by any law.""

This week the Supreme Court unanimously torpedoed Rishi Sunak's plans to deport asylum seekers to Rwanda, ruling the project already costing £140million is unlawful. The Tory leader has since pledged to introduce ""emergency legislation"" to resurrect the proposals by having Parliament deem Rwanda a ""safe country"".

But in an article for the Telegraph, Ms Braverman, who was sacked from the Cabinet on Monday, warned flights will not take off before the election under the plan. She said: ""To try and deliver flights to Rwanda under any new treaty would still require going back through the courts, a process that would likely take at least another year.

""Even if we won in the domestic court, the saga would simply relocate to Strasbourg where the European court would take its time deciding if it liked our laws. ""That is why the plan outlined by the PM will not yield flights to Rwanda before an election if Plan B is simply a tweaked version of the failed Plan A.""

The former Cabinet minister proposed ""five tests"" including the incendiary suggestion of excluding the prospect of legal challenges to the Government's plan.

She wrote: ""The Bill must enable flights before the next general election. Legislation must therefore circumvent the lengthy process of further domestic litigation, to ensure that flights can take off as soon as the new Bill becomes law. To do this, the Bill must exclude all avenues of legal challenge. ""

The right-wing Conservative also suggested Parliament sit over Christmas to ensure the new emergency law can be passed before next year.

On Thursday the Tory Chancellor Jeremy Hunt refused to commit to asylum seekers being sent to the east African country in 2024 - or before the next election. He said: ""We are hopeful that because of the solutions that the Prime Minister announced yesterday we will be able to get flights off to Rwanda next year. We can't guarantee that.""

Speaking on BBC Question Time, the Shadow Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson said she hoped Tory ministers ""give up"" on the ""unworkable"" and Rwanda plan. She added: ""I agree with the new Home Secretary who described the policy as being batshit. It's just not going to work, it's not the right approach. It's costing us £140million"".","{'uri': 'mirror.co.uk', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'Mirror'}","[{'uri': 'ashley_cowburn@mirror.co.uk', 'name': 'Ashley Cowburn', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': False}]",https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article31460935.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/3_Suella-Braverman-Bushy-United-Kingdom-16-Nov-2023.jpg,eng-9063836,0.04313725490196085,25,25,Mirror,mirror.co.uk

Whistleblower David McBride has pleaded guilty to three charges after an ACT supreme court upheld a commonwealth intervention to withhold key evidence it deemed as having the potential to jeopardise ""the security and defence of Australia"" if released.

Originally facing five charges, the former military lawyer pleaded guilty in the ACT supreme court on Friday afternoon to three offences, including stealing commonwealth information and passing that on to journalists at the Australian Broadcasting Corporation.

The ABC subsequently used the material as the basis for an investigative series exposing war crimes in Afghanistan, titled The Afghan Files.

On Friday afternoon, Justice David Mossop upheld the commonwealth's claim that certain documents, if released, had the potential to jeopardise ""the security and defence of Australia"" and should not be used by the parties.

Andrew Berger KC, acting for the commonwealth, on Wednesday said some material in the case should be kept entirely secret on national security grounds.

""The public interest at play here is a very important one, the national security and defence of this country,"" he said. ""Indeed, we say it is harder to think of a stronger public interest than the security and defence of Australia.""

Berger presented evidence from intelligence agencies, including the Office of National Intelligence, suggesting that its disclosure could compromise intelligence information provided by Australia's allies.

Releasing those documents, Berger added, would jeopardise Australia's information-sharing agreements with foreign intelligence agencies and damage Australia's reputation more broadly.

McBride's counsel, Stephen Odgers SC, had previously indicated he may apply to have the trial halted if the commonwealth's bid to keep documents secret was accepted.

The former military lawyer's team suffered a blow on Thursday after they lost a legal bid to overturn a ruling by Justice Mossop preventing McBride from arguing he was fulfilling his duty to the public interest in releasing the classified documents.

The trial was scheduled to begin on Monday. A sentencing date is expected to be scheduled in the new year.","{'uri': 'theguardian.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","[{'uri': 'christopher_knaus@theguardian.com', 'name': 'Christopher Knaus', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': False}, {'uri': 'sarah_basford_canales@theguardian.com', 'name': 'Sarah Basford Canales', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': False}]",https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/daba19a8d36f3841d4961e9104d61a15436f00c5/0_50_5472_3283/master/5472.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&s=16d46589fe2fa21814394a4700291747,,0.3725490196078431,25,25,The Guardian,theguardian.com

Here's a look at what it does,"{{ #verifyErrors }}{{ message }}{{ /verifyErrors }}{{ ^verifyErrors }}Something went wrong. Please try again later{{ /verifyErrors }}

A trial for a lawsuit challenging the constitutionality of Missouri's new photo identification requirement for voters is scheduled to begin Friday. Here is a look at the function of the law and why voting rights groups are suing:

WHAT THE LAW DOES

Missouri's GOP-led Legislature last year capped off a nearly two-decade-long push by Republicans and passed a law requiring voters to show photo identification to cast a regular ballot.

People without a government-issued photo ID can cast provisional ballots to be counted if they return later that day with a photo ID or if election officials verify their signatures. The law requires the state to provide a free photo identification card to those lacking one to vote.

LEGAL CHALLENGES

The Missouri League of Women Voters, NAACP and two voters sued to overturn the law last year, arguing the change makes casting ballots unconstitutionally difficult for some voters.

Cole County Presiding Judge Jon Beetem, who also will hear arguments in the trial beginning Friday, dismissed the case in October 2022. He found neither of the two voters ""alleged a specific, concrete, non-speculative injury or legally protectable interest in challenging the photo ID requirement.""

The Missouri ACLU and Missouri Voter Protection Coalition, who sued on behalf of the plaintiffs, have since added another voter to the lawsuit and asked Beetem again to find the voter ID requirement unconstitutional.

ARGUMENTS AGAINST THE LAW

The newest plaintiff is John O'Connor, a 90-year-old Columbia, Missouri, resident with poor vision who needs help walking. When the law took effect last year, O'Connor had an expired passport and driver's license, which are not acceptable forms of identification to vote under state law.

His lawyers argued he eventually obtained a non-driver's license with the help of his wife, but only because officials accepted his expired driver's license despite guidance from the state Revenue Department that long-expired licenses are not acceptable records to use when seeking new IDs.

""Even when a voter obtains the underlying documentation, voters who lack transportation, cannot get to the DMV or other government agencies during their hours of operation, or have a disability or impairment that prevents them from accessing a DMV, the voter is still unable to surmount the burdens to obtaining a photo ID,"" the plaintiffs' lawyers wrote in a pretrial brief.

ARGUMENTS FOR THE LAW

Republican Attorney General Andrew Bailey's office is defending the law in court. The state lawyers argue that, so far, no one has been turned away at the polls because of the law.

Missouri provides free non-driver's licenses for voting to those who do not already have a driver's license or have a current license. The health department's Bureau of Vital Records provides free birth certificates to those seeking their first non-driver's license in order to vote if the applicant does not have a current driver's license.

""There is not a severe burden on the right to vote as the State has gone to great lengths to help voters obtain IDs,"" Bailey wrote in a court brief.

VOTER ID ELSEWHERE

The National Conference of State Legislatures reports 36 states request or require identification to vote, of which at least 20 ask for a photo ID.

Other Republican-led states are moving in the same direction as Missouri as they respond to conservative voters unsettled by unfounded claims of widespread fraud and persistent conspiracy theories over the accuracy of U.S. elections. Critics characterize such requirements as an overreaction that could disenfranchise eligible voters.

For the first time this year, Ohio voters were required show photo identification to cast ballots in person. The new law eliminated previously acceptable non-photo options, such as a utility bill, bank statement, government check or paycheck. State-issued photo IDs are available free of charge

Missouri Republicans are not the only ones who had to fight for years to enact ID requirements.

North Carolina's voter photo identification law, enacted nearly five years ago by the Republican-controlled legislature but blocked by litigation, is just now being implemented. Registered voters there can get free IDs at their county election offices if they provide their name, date of birth and the last four digits of their Social Security number.

Nebraska lawmakers this summer passed a voter ID law allowing a wide array of photo identification that voters can present at the polls. IDs include passports, driver's licenses, military and tribal IDs and Nebraska college IDs. Expired IDs are allowed if they have the voter's name and photo. Residents of hospitals, nursing homes and assisted living centers will be able to use patient documents that include a photo.","{'uri': 'independent.co.uk', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'The Independent'}",[],https://static.independent.co.uk/2023/11/17/05/Voter_ID_Missouri_55700.jpg?quality=75&width=1200&auto=webp,eng-9069794,-0.06666666666666665,25,25,The Independent,independent.co.uk

Network 10 is attempting to shift its legal stoush with Lisa Wilkinson to the Federal Court as the two sides battle over her legal bills in the upcoming Bruce Lehrmann defamation case.

Ms Wilkinson has launched court proceedings against Network 10 to force her employer to immediately stump up for her defence in the suit, where both she and the broadcaster are named as respondents.

The two sides are arguing over whether the $700,000 bill should be settled immediately or at the end of the defamation proceedings.

Mr Lehrmann is suing Ms Wilkinson and Network 10 in the Federal Court over her 2021 interview with Brittany Higgins, which aired on The Project, with the trial due to begin on Wednesday.

Ms Wilkinson is also locked in a separate legal battle with Network 10 in the NSW Supreme Court after she elected to hire her own legal representation.

Ms Wilkinson hired high-profile barrister Sue Chrysanthou SC and Gillis Delaney Lawyers partner Anthony Jefferies earlier this year instead of opting to use Network 10's retained law firm Thomson Geer.

Lisa Wilkinson is locked in a separate legal battle with Network 10 in the NSW Supreme Court after she elected to hire her own legal representation for her defamation case with Bruce Lehrmann

According to documents filed in the NSW Supreme Court, she claims the broadcaster is refusing to pay two invoices totalling $723,000 in legal fees.

Barrister Zoe Graus, acting for Ten, told the court on Friday that the network was moving an application to shift the proceedings to the Federal Court, where the defamation suit is being heard.

Justice Michael Bell told the court that the cross-vesting application - to transfer the matter to the Federal Court - 'turned on' whether there was a possibility of inconsistent findings.

The matter will return to court next Friday.

Ms Wilkinson alleges Network 10 twice accepted it was liable to indemnify the TV star even if she was 'independently represented'.

Bruce Lehrmann is suing Ms Wilkinson and Network 10 in the Federal Court over her 2021 interview with Brittany Higgins, which aired on The Project, with the trial due to begin on Wednesday

In a statement, Network 10 said: 'The lawyers engaged by Lisa Wilkinson have issued invoices for a very substantial amount of money, in excess of $700,000, and in good governance these need to be justified through due process.

'In the meantime, Network 10's focus is on defending the defamation claim brought by Bruce Lehrmann.'

Mr Lehrmann has also launched defamation proceedings against the ABC over the live broadcast of a National Press Club address by Ms Higgins.

While he was not named in the report or Ms Higgins' speech, Mr Lehrmann claims he was still identified by the media companies and has alleged there were four defamatory meanings in their publication implying he raped her at Parliament House in March 2019.

He had pleaded not guilty to a single charge of sexual assault.

Judge Arthur Engoron - who is overseeing the fraud trial that is ongoing against Trump - slapped a limited gag order on the former president on October 3 after he insulted the judge's principal law clerk in a post on his Truth Social platform.

On Thursday, another judge, Associate Justice David Friedman, temporarily lifted the gag order pending a hearing about whether it should be in place amid concerns it could impinge on Trump's freedom of speech.

'Considering the constitutional and statutory rights at issue an interim stay is granted,' the appellate judge wrote.

News of the interim stay prompted the former president return to his social media platform once again to decry the 'wicked attack on democracy' by Engoron and his 'Trump hating clerk.'

Trump has already been fined $15,000 for violating the gag order imposed during the fraud trial brought by New York Attorney General Letitia James

Trump blasted the 'ridiculous and unconstitutional' gag order as well as Engoron who he accused of not allowing him to 'defend myself against him and his politically biased and out of control, Trump Hating Clerk, who is sinking him and his Court to new levels of low.'

Engoron previously fined the 77-year-old Trump a total of $15,000 for two violations of the restriction during the trial brought by New York Attorney General Letitia James.

James was also targeted by Trump, who called her 'the worst and least respected Attorney General in the United States' and a 'worldwide disgrace.'

He fumed: 'The radical and unprecedented actions of Judge Engoron will keep businesses and jobs forever out of New York State.

'I have done nothing wrong my numbers were low, not high, I have a complete disclaimer clause, their star witness admitted he lied and made up this Fake case against me, and the the Attorney General used a ""Get Trump"" platform in order to run for A.G. & Governor (she failed!). This wicked attack on Democracy must be ended, now!'

Judge David Friedman granted an interim stay on the gag order pending a hearing about whether it infringes on Trump's right to free speech

Trump, the frontrunner for the 2024 Republican presidential nomination, and his two eldest sons are accused of inflating the value of their real estate assets to receive more favorable bank loans and insurance terms.

The federal judge set to preside over Trump's March trial in Washington for conspiring to overturn the 2020 presidential election also imposed a partial gag order on the brash billionaire, but that order has also been frozen pending an appeals court hearing to take place on Monday.

US District Judge Tanya Chutkan ordered Trump last month not to publicly attack prosecutors, court staff or potential witnesses ahead of his trial.

Chutkan's ruling came after special counsel Jack Smith, a frequent target of Trump's vitriol, filed a motion claiming the real estate tycoon's inflammatory rhetoric threatened to undermine his trial for election subversion.

Trump was indicted in Washington for allegedly seeking to upend the results of the 2020 election in a concerted effort that led to the violent January 6 attack on the US Capitol by his supporters.

Trump also faces federal charges for alleged mishandling of top secret documents after he left the White House, and has been indicted for racketeering in Georgia on accusations that he tried to overturn the 2020 election results in the southern state.","{'uri': 'dailymail.co.uk', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'Daily Mail Online'}",[],https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2023/11/17/03/77914567-0-image-m-39_1700193034919.jpg,eng-9065743,-0.4588235294117647,25,25,Daily Mail Online,dailymail.co.uk

Adani faces renewed pressure after Hindenburg report of January

By Arpan Chaturvedi and Aditya Kalra

NEW DELHI, Nov 17 (Reuters) - Indian investigators are seeking to restart a probe into Adani Group for alleged overvaluation of coal imports and have asked the Supreme Court to allow them to collect evidence from Singapore, a step they say the company thwarted for years, legal documents show.

The Directorate of Revenue Intelligence since 2016 has been trying to procure transaction documents related to Adani's dealings from Singapore authorities. The agency suspects many of the group's coal shipments imported from Indonesian suppliers were first billed at higher prices on paper to its Singapore unit, Adani Global Pte, and then to its Indian arms.

Adani Enterprises and its subsidiaries, led by billionaire Gautam Adani, have successfully mounted repeated legal challenges in India and Singapore to block the documents' release, court papers show. Adani has denied wrongdoing, saying that Indian authorities assessed its coal shipments before releasing them from ports.

In an Oct. 9 legal filing, which Reuters is reporting for the first time, the revenue intelligence agency asked India's Supreme Court to quash a previous lower court order that allowed Adani to block authorities from collecting evidence from Singapore.

The Indian officials dispute Adani's arguments that the agency did not follow ""due process"", saying in the filing it had approval to seek information from the Southeast Asian city-state under a mutual legal assistance treaty.

""Permission for following this route was obtained from the Ministry of Finance as well as (the) Ministry of Home Affairs,"" the 25-page filing states, adding that the investigation ""is completely in compliance"".

In a statement to Reuters, Adani Group said it had ""fully co-operated"" with the authorities by providing details and documents sought more than four years ago and that ""no deficiency or objection"" was communicated by investigators thereafter.

The Indian revenue agency did not respond to Reuters' queries.

The effort to revive the coal probe comes amid wider regulatory scrutiny of Adani since Hindenburg Research in January accused the tycoon and his conglomerate of improper use of tax havens and stock manipulation.

Despite Adani's denials, the short seller's report triggered a $150 billion plunge in the group's stocks. India's Supreme Court is also overseeing the market regulator's probe of Hindenburg's allegations.

Amid the fallout and ahead of India's 2024 election, political opponents have increased pressure on Prime Minister Narendra Modi's administration, accusing it of favouritism toward Adani in government decisions.

Modi and Adani, who both hail from Gujarat, have denied impropriety.

The revenue agency began looking into Adani's imports as part of a broader investigation into 40 companies that started in 2014. Investigators alleged the companies importing Indonesian coal were overinvoicing deliveries by showing bills of shipments routed through intermediaries in Singapore and elsewhere.

Indian authorities reviewed 1,300 shipments involving Adani and alleged in court filings that it ""grossly overstated"" or ""artificially inflated the import value of coal"" as compared with the export value from Indonesia, ""with the objective of siphoning off"" funds to tax havens and charging higher power prices in India.

The sums involved may run into billions of rupees, according to the agency, which has not identified any Indonesian supplier.

BATTLE IN SINGAPORE

The evidence India is seeking from Singapore authorities, which includes transaction documents from 20 of Adani's banks there, could help establish a financial trail in the case, a person with direct knowledge of the matter told Reuters.

If India's Supreme Court allows the agency's latest request, it would then need to seek an order from Singapore's Court of Appeal to release the material.

The Singapore court declined requests from Reuters last month to inspect related case documents, saying in written responses that the files were sealed.

But a Reuters review of hundreds of pages of Indian court filings and orders reveal a tussle between India and Adani that stretched from Mumbai to New Delhi to Singapore in recent years.

In 2019, on Adani's challenge, the High Court of Mumbai cited procedural lapses in quashing the request by Indian investigators to collect evidence against Adani.

Days later, the agency appealed to the Supreme Court, which put the Mumbai verdict on hold ""until further orders"", which the agency contended in a subsequent Supreme Court filing meant ""the investigation could be continued"".

But the Singapore court in late 2020, after Adani's request, said the documents should not be released for now because India's top court had not reached a final decision, according to two people with direct knowledge of the matter and a Reuters review of legal orders.

In a statement to Reuters, the office of Singapore Attorney-General Lucien Wong said the Singapore court had not opined on the merits of Adani's appeals and the case was still pending.

The stance adopted by Adani's companies in Singapore ""created impediments"" and the investigation ""remains stalled"", the revenue agency told India's Supreme Court in 2021 filings.

The case was not heard for around two years, until the agency told the Supreme Court in July that it wanted to update judges about certain events in Singapore, without elaborating. It then lodged its October filing in a fresh bid to obtain evidence.

The next hearing is scheduled for Feb. 6.

The Minneapolis Police Department has lost more than 300 officers since 2018.

Last week, Police Chief Brian O'Hara and Frey announced an agreement for $15,000 recruitment bonuses and $18,000 retention bonuses.

The council voted to not even consider their plan and it left the police chief beside himself.

""We are at such a critical point. This is really beyond words,"" O'Hara said.

One reason why it's so difficult to rebuild MPD's ranks: New numbers from a statewide police union shows the city of Blaine is number one in starting pay. Minneapolis is number 18 in starting pay.

New cops in Blaine make about $93,000 a year. In Minneapolis, they make about $71,000 a year.

""You can't play politics with public safety. You have too many people dying,"" O'Hara said.

On top of recruiting cops, keeping them is even harder. Minneapolis ranks 21st for paying veteran officers.

Number one is Inver Grove Heights, which pays its top officers $112,000 a year. Minneapolis pays its top officers $103,000 a year.

It's a lot less pay for working in a much bigger city with a lot more crime -- it's hard for O'Hara to comprehend.

""You have too many victims of violent crime and one of the lowest staffed police department of any city in America,"" O'Hara said.

The Minneapolis pay bonuses would be paid over a three-year period.","{'uri': 'cbsnews.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'CBS News'}",[],https://assets2.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2023/06/17/42b0fb33-abc4-4314-98fe-b10f7da3c024/thumbnail/1200x630/946b5722a070b15cf691707b6efb81db/cbsn-fusion-minneapolis-police-have-history-of-bias-beyond-george-floyd-killing-doj-says-thumbnail-2057801-640x360.jpg?v=0468e1acbdfcea10e0b300333bc497c4,,-0.003921568627450966,25,25,CBS News,cbsnews.com

A Tennessee man was arrested Saturday after allegedly driving a tractor train made to cart children around, while under the influence and in possession of meth, according to reports.

ABC station WATE reported that several people, including officers with the Tazewell Police Department, turned their attention to ""Santa's Train,"" when the conductor, identified as 40-year-old Henry Meade, began acting erratically.

The Tazewell Police Department said Mead was driving a riding lawnmower that was converted into a train made to pull two carts behind it.

The train was intended to give families rides during the Christmas Tractor Parade in Tazewell, which ran down Main Street.

When officers approached Meade, he was reportedly unsteady on his feet.

A further investigation determined Meade was under the influence, police said. He was ultimately taken into custody, and a search discovered he was in possession of a syringe, methamphetamine and other narcotics.

Meade has been charged with DUI, possession of methamphetamine, possession of narcotics, and possession of drug paraphernalia.

He was booked into the Claiborne County Jail, and as of Thursday, was still behind bars.

In a Facebook post, the Tazewell Police Department and the city's mayor, Bill Fannon, addressed Saturday night's incident.

""Despite this, the Tazewell Police Department responded swiftly to the incident, ensuring the safety of event attendees.

The police department added that there were 14 police officers on foot patrol for several thousands of attendees, and just like any day and any time, public safety was paramount.

The Placer County Sheriff's Office said those suspects are connected to an international theft group.

The call first came in as an attempted burglary on Bella Terra Place in Granite Bay. After a short pursuit by the Placer County sheriff's deputies, the suspects eventually led authorities on a chase that crossed into Sacramento County, where they reportedly topped speeds of 100 miles per hour.

Overhead video from a Sacramento County Sheriff's Office helicopter follows the suspects to the backyard of a home near Gerber Road in south Sacramento. A sheriff's K9 unit was deployed in the backyard of a home, and deputies arrested the suspects.

During the apprehension, both suspects were identified by visas they had in their possession - turned out they were fake identities.

The suspects were identified by their fingerprints as Placido Lopez-Vargas and Angel Emmanuel. Both, according to Placer County Sheriff Wayne Woo, are associated with South American theft groups.

""These organized crime groups from another country are now in our county,"" Sheriff Woo said.

In fact, the sheriff says the Granite Bay community has been plagued with burglaries for the last year.

""In excess of 20 burglaries, we think, were committed by this same group with losses totaling over a million dollars,"" Sheriff Woo said.

In July, CBS13 covered a string of home burglaries that all happened on the same day in upscale neighborhoods in Granite Bay and Sacramento.

""There's a lot of anger. There's a lot of grief,"" one of the homeowners affected by the July burglaries said.

Investigators say these burglaries are targeted.

""We have evidence leading us to believe that these groups traveled specifically from Southern California to the Placer County area,"" Sheriff Woo said.

He is now urging his Placer County residents to stay vigilant as his agency, in coordination with other jurisdictions, works to find whoever is responsible and hold them accountable.

He reportedly approached the female around 8:25 a.m., police said.

The Contra Costa County District Attorney's Office and the Bay Area Air Quality Management District on Thursday jointly announced a common civil enforcement action that also includes the California Department of Fish and Wildlife and Contra Costa County Health.

All the agencies have notices of violation and enforcement referrals against MRC. They're working with the refinery to reach an acceptable penalty for the Thanksgiving night 2022 release, as well as at least three smaller chemical releases the past year.

""The goal of this joint effort with the air district is to achieve a resolution that ensures environmental compliance, and to rebuild and foster a safer community for the residents of Martinez,"" Contra Costa County District Attorney Diana Becton said.

""We welcome the opportunity to work collaboratively with the Contra Costa County District Attorney's Office as we take a comprehensive approach to ensure MRC's compliance with all air quality regulations,"" said Alexander Crockett, chief counsel of the air district. ""This partnership combines our prosecutorial resources to help ensure we achieve the best possible results for the residents of Martinez.""

About 9:30 p.m. on Nov. 24, 2022, the refinery released an estimated 20 to 24 tons of ""spent catalyst"" into the surrounding community until the following morning, when residents found their yards and vehicles covered in metallic dust.

The refinery failed to alert the county health department and the community warning system, both of which are legally mandated within 15 minutes of a release.

County health officials didn't find out about the release until the following Saturday when alerted to social media posts about the dust.

Initial testing of the Thanksgiving release showed the dust contained elevated levels of aluminum, barium, chromium, nickel, vanadium and zinc, all of which can cause respiratory problems.

The refinery has since apologized and told the City of Martinez it has taken 11 specific corrective actions: two associated with equipment, six associated with refinery procedures, and three associated with better training.

The refinery has also been involved in three smaller releases of ""coke dust"" that occurred since July. Coke dust is a byproduct of oil refining. The first release, on July 11, lasted less than a minute and created steam with coke dust, which was carried into the community by wind.

The second release was on July 22 and was contained on-site. The third release happened Oct. 6 and was termed by refinery officials as ""brief.""

The joint action is a ""pre-filing"" move and meant to find common ground on a penalty. The conversations between agencies also have included MRC, the district attorney's office said. It's not a settlement agreement and is just the first move in finding a suitable penalty.

If the agencies and MRC can't all find common ground, the DA's office will likely move forward with charges, the DA's office said.","{'uri': 'cbsnews.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'CBS News'}",[],https://assets1.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2023/05/29/b9f0a35e-b466-4ab8-b621-d2ae2bc9327d/thumbnail/1200x630/ab36e97fa0c817ea153d882006b7c8fd/rfinry.jpg?v=31b2603d647356ee899167281d5e1b87,,0.1450980392156862,25,25,CBS News,cbsnews.com

Julian Assange is fighting extradition to the US for violating its 1917 Espionage Act, while in the UK a strict national security regime also prevails

Since the national security law for Hong Kong was enacted in 2020, it has more than proved its worth. It has not only ensured the survival of the “one country, two systems” policy, but also restored the city’s equilibrium.

Its success was such that, in 2022, President Xi Jinping made it clear that one country, two systems, which the Sino-British Joint Declaration of 1984 envisaged lasting for 50 years, “must be adhered to over the long run”.

Although the national security law is heavy on human rights, Western countries often demonise it. Despite having tough national security regimes of their own, they reacted to the enactment of the law for Hong Kong.

The United States, for example, ended the city’s trading preferences and handicapped its exports, banning “Made in Hong Kong” labelling. The United Kingdom urged British judges to resign from Hong Kong’s Court of Final Appeal, pressured a British barrister into withdrawing from a prosecution, and suspended its fugitive surrender agreement with Hong Kong.

Although British Foreign Secretary James Cleverly claimed in September that the national security law “continues to undermine Hong Kong’s legal and judicial systems”, this is not how its operators see things.

Since the enactment of the law, the judiciary has skilfully interpreted its provisions in a way that respects common law traditions. Indeed, in 2021, the Court of Final Appeal noted that “it is evident that the legislative intention is for the [national security law] to operate in tandem with the laws of the [Hong Kong special administrative region], seeking ‘convergence, compatibility and complementarity’ with local laws”.

When the highest court’s latest overseas recruit, Patrick Keane, former chief justice of the Federal Court of Australia, was appointed a non-permanent judge earlier this year, he noted “how successful” the court has been in “upholding the rule of law”. The Court of Final Appeal, he said, had a long history as “a very successful institution that’s made an important contribution to the success of Hong Kong”. It is a pity that the US lawmakers who have sought to sanction some of its judges were not listening.

In 2021, moreover, when British jurists faced pressure to resign as non-permanent Court of Final Appeal judges, one of them, Lord Sumption, rightly explained that the national security law contains “guarantees of human rights”.

The law not only stipulates in Article 4 that “human rights shall be respected and protected in safeguarding national security”, but also that the provisions of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) “shall be protected in accordance with the law”. The covenant is also applicable under Article 39 of the Basic Law.

Among those rights is the right to a fair trial. This includes access to legal counsel, the presumption of innocence, the testing of prosecution witnesses, the giving and calling of evidence, and conviction only when guilt is proved beyond reasonable doubt.A most severe national security law you will have never heard of

Despite this, foreign critics of the national security law have complained about the limitations on jury trials in national security cases (as where jurors face intimidation), restrictions on overseas lawyers taking part in such cases (due to the risk of state secrets being leaked), and the law’s extraterritorial reach (designed to protect Hong Kong from foreign dangers).

Yet the critics have little to say about other national security regimes, however draconian.

In Singapore, for example, the Internal Security Act is far harsher. Not only has trial by jury been abolished altogether, but Singapore has never signed the ICCPR. Unlike Hong Kong, it retains the death penalty, and national security suspects can be detained by executive order without trial for up to two years, which can be extended.

In the US, a battery of laws have dealt with national security, including the Patriot Act (2001). In suspected terrorism cases, the act weakened privacy rights by allowing the government access to people’s telephone records without court authorisation. Although the act was reformed by the Freedom Act (2015), which was supposed to end bulk surveillance, the National Security Agency still collected large amounts of data.

In the UK, WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange, incarcerated since April 2019, is fighting extradition to the US for allegedly, while outside the US, contravening its Espionage Act (1917).

Assange’s WikiLeaks revealed how at Guantanamo Bay, the US military prison in Cuba for terror suspects, new prisoners were held in isolation to soften them up before what was euphemistically called “enhanced interrogation”. The New York Times says that since 2002, about 780 prisoners have been held at Guantanamo Bay, of whom 30 remain. Some have been held for years without due process, with little or no complaint from Britain and its partners.

In the UK, a strict national security regime also prevails, including the National Security Act (2023). Its sweeping provisions create new espionage and sabotage offences, curb the pre-trial rights of suspects, and give the police intrusive search powers. Unlike the national security law for Hong Kong, it does not incorporate the ICCPR. It was denounced in Parliament for its “chilling effect” on investigative journalism, and the Campaign for Freedom of Information called it “oppressive and disproportionate”.

Since 2003, moreover, it has been possible for British judges to dispense with juries if there is a serious risk of jury tampering, yet the critics only complain when this happens in Hong Kong. Even though foreign lawyers are generally barred from British courts, the critics fret over Hong Kong restrictions on overseas lawyers in national security trials.

To be credible, Western powers need to end their double standards. The national security law has been wisely applied by an independent judiciary, and its prioritisation of human rights distinguishes it from less liberal national security regimes elsewhere.

The Supreme Court said Thursday it will not allow Florida to enforce its new law targeting drag shows , while a court case proceeds. Pictured: Ron DeSantis at the signing of the bill in May

Florida had asked the court to allow its anti-drag show law to be enforced everywhere except at the Hamburger Mary's restaurant in Orlando, which challenged the law's constitutionality

Hamburger Mary's challenge alleged the law 'prohibits protected speech based on the identity of the speaker' and is vague and overbroad.

The district court found that the law likely restricted free speech and couldn't be enforced anywhere in the state.

Hamburger Mary´s regularly hosts drag shows, including family-friendly performances on Sundays that children are invited to attend.

The restaurant´s owner said the law was overly broad, was written vaguely and violated First Amendment rights by chilling speech.

The new law championed by Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis, who is running for the 2024 GOP presidential nomination, punished venues for allowing children into what it called 'adult live performances.'

Though it did not mention drag shows specifically, the sponsor of the legislation said it was aimed at those performances.

Venues that violated the law faced fines and the possibility that their liquor licenses to be suspended or revoked. Individuals could be charged with a misdemeanor crime.

The new law prevents venues from allowing children admission to 'any show, exhibition, or other presentation that is performed in front of a live audience and in whole or in part, depicts or simulates nudity, sexual conduct, sexual excitement, specific sexual activities, ... lewd conduct, or the lewd exposure of prosthetic or imitation genitals or breasts.'

Three justices, Samuel Alito, Neil Gorsuch and Clarence Thomas , said they would have granted the state's request

If venues were found to have violated the law regulators would be able to suspend of revoke their licenses.

Presnell, who was appointed to the bench by President Bill Clinton in 2000, said the so-called Protection of Children law, was 'specifically designed to suppress the speech of drag queen performers' and that the state 'already has statutes that provide' protection from obscene behavior.

The judge said the law was ill-defined and 'vulnerable to broad subjectivity.'

'A fully clothed drag queen with cleavage-displaying prosthetic breasts reading an age-appropriate story to children may be adjudged 'wicked' -- and thus 'lewd' -- by some, but such a scenario would not constitute the kind of obscene conduct prohibited by the statutes' in previous case law, Presnell wrote in the 24 page judgement.

Presnell also drew attention to issues raised by the focus on 'prosthetic or imitation genitals or breasts.'

He asked what the implications may be for cancer survivors with prosthetic genitals or breasts.

Presnell said the law also clashed with the 'Parents' Bill of Rights' and other laws.'

'All parental rights are reserved to the parent of a minor child in this state' he wrote, 'including...the right to direct the upbringing and the moral or religious training of his or her minor child.'","{'uri': 'dailymail.co.uk', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'Daily Mail Online'}",[],https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2023/11/17/01/77906171-0-image-a-12_1700183563408.jpg,eng-9068811,0.06666666666666665,25,25,Daily Mail Online,dailymail.co.uk

A New York judge has lifted the gag order imposed on former President Donald Trump in his civil fraud trial stemming from state Attorney General Letitia James' lawsuit against him and the Trump Organization.

Citing concerns over free speech, appeals court Judge David Friedman issued a stay on the order Thursday, which was put in place by Judge Arthur Engoran in October.

Engoron, who is overseeing Trump's trial, imposed the partial gag order to block all parties from making derogatory statements about his court staff. He fined Trump $5,000 for violating the order on social media on Oct. 20, and did so again on Oct. 25 for another $10,000 before threatening imprisonment if further violations were committed.

JUDGE IN TRUMP'S GEORGIA ELECTION INTERFERENCE CASE ORDERS 'SENSITIVE' EVIDENCE WITHHELD FROM PUBLIC

At Thursday's emergency hearing, Friedman questioned Engoron's authority to limit Trump's speech outside the courtroom, and argued gag orders were used more in criminal trials where there is a fear of swaying a jury. The ruling also applies to Trump's lawyers, who say they have no plans to inhibit the former president's First Amendment rights.

Trump celebrated the ruling in a post on Truth Social, in which he railed against Engoran.

""Judge Arthur Engoron has just been overturned (stayed!) by the New York State Appellate Division (Appeals Court), for the 4th TIME (on the same case!). His Ridiculous and Unconstitutional Gag Order, not allowing me to defend myself against him and his politically biased and out of control, Trump Hating Clerk, who is sinking him and his Court to new levels of LOW, is a disgrace,"" he wrote.

Trump reiterated that he did ""nothing wrong,"" and again accused James of having run on a ""Get Trump"" platform during her campaign.

The U.S. Supreme Court denied Florida's request on Thursday to reinstate its anti-drag law, marking a victory for opponents of the legislation.

Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis signed a law in May that punishes venues if they allow people younger than 18 to attend ""adult live performances"" that contain sexually explicit or lewd content, including exposure to ""prosthetic genitals and breasts."" The businesses could face fines of $10,000, the loss of their business and liquor licenses, and criminal penalties for not complying.

Though the legislation doesn't explicitly name drag performances, the sponsor of the bill said that it targeted drag performances.

The law was challenged in May by Hamburger Mary's, a bar and grill in Orlando that frequently hosts family-friendly drag shows.

In a lawsuit against the state and DeSantis, the business argued that the law was a violation of free speech and that its phrasing was ""vague and indistinct.""

In June, a federal judge sided with Hamburger Mary's and issued a preliminary order blocking the law from taking full effect. The state of Florida appealed the court's ruling to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 11th District, which is still pending.

Florida Attorney General Ashley Moody filed a stay motion to the 11th Circuit, asking that it limit the injunction to apply only to Hamburger Mary's rather than to all establishments in the state during the appeal process.

After the motion was denied by a divided 11th Circuit panel, the state turned to the U.S. Supreme Court to request that the law be reinstated. In a motion filed to the higher court, Moody said that ""Florida is now unable to enforce its statute at all, to the detriment of Florida's children and the State's sovereign prerogative to protect them from harm"" as a result of the injunction.

According to The Washington Post, the restaurant's attorney Donald A. Donati urged the Supreme Court not to allow the law to take effect, pointing out that Florida already has laws that prevent children from viewing sexually explicit material.

Donati added that Hamburger Mary's drag shows are ""not harmful to minors"" but that restaurant owners are worried about being prosecuted for violating the law because of its broad and vague language.

On Thursday, the Supreme Court also refused to reinstate the law with a vote of 6-3, NPR reported. In a statement explaining the decision, Justice Brett Kavanaugh and Justice Amy Coney Barrett said that the decision does not reflect their own views on whether the law violates the First Amendment but that the state didn't raise the issue in its filings to the court.

The three dissenting justices, Clarence Thomas, Samuel Alito and Neil Gorsuch, indicated that they would have allowed the law to take effect.

HuffPost reached out to Moody's and DeSantis' offices for comment but did not receive an immediate response.

The law will not be able to take effect as the appeal process continues.","{'uri': 'huffpost.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'HuffPost'}",[],https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/6556b488230000ea71ea5f1f.jpeg?cache=NSRrizViwP&ops=1200_630,eng-9068811,-0.1764705882352942,25,25,HuffPost,huffpost.com

""Considering the constitutional and statutory rights at issue an interim stay is granted,"" wrote Associate Justice David Friedman, of New York state's intermediate appeals court.

He issued the stay in response to a request filed by Trump's legal team earlier this week that argued the gag order violated his First-Amendment -- as well as the state's -- freedom-of-speech rights.

The gag order on the former president was imposed by Judge Arthur Engoron after a derogatory post appeared on Trump's Truth Social platform. He has fined Trump twice since then for violations, most recently for $10,000 after he made a remark outside the courtroom that Engoron concluded was made in reference to the judge's principal law clerk, Allison Greenfield.

Friedman's order also grants temporary relief to Trump's attorneys, who have also been prohibited by Judge Engoron from discussing his communications with his staff.

Trump posted about the ruling on his social media site Thursday, once again targeting Engoron and Greenfield.

""His Ridiculous and Unconstitutional Gag Order, not allowing me to defend myself against him and his politically biased and out of control, Trump Hating Clerk, who is sinking him and his Court to new levels of LOW, is a disgrace,"" Trump wrote.

In a written order, Engoron wrote that Trump's attorneys have made ""repeated, inappropriate remarks about my Principal Law Clerk, falsely accusing her of bias against them and of improperly influencing"" the trial.

""Defendants' attorneys have made long speeches alleging that it is improper for a judge to consult with a law clerk during ongoing proceedings, and that the passing of notes from a judge to a law clerk, or vice-versa, constitutes an improper 'appearance of impropriety' in this case,"" he wrote. ""These arguments have no basis.""

On Wednesday, attorneys for Trump requested a mistrial be declared in the case, claiming the judge and his clerk have subjected the defendants to ""tangible and overwhelming"" bias and unfair treatment.

The motion for a mistrial makes good on a promise Trump's attorneys made to file it the day he testified in the case on Nov. 6. The announcement capped off an intense day of examination in which Trump -- who has frequently criticized Engoron and Greenfield -- even lashed out at the judge on the witness stand, pointing at him and calling him a ""fraud.""

Engoron is overseeing the case brought by New York Attorney General Letitia James against Trump, his two oldest sons, the Trump Organization and several executives in New York State Supreme Court in Manhattan. James' office alleges the defendants orchestrated a decade-long fraud scheme to inflate the value of the company's properties and Trump's personal wealth. Engoron has already found the Trumps and their company liable for business fraud.

The trial, which is related to other allegations in the suit, is currently in its seventh week.

Five European countries and Canada are seeking to join a case brought by the Gambia at the United Nations' highest court that accuses Burma of committing genocide against its Rohingya minority.

The International Court of Justice said Thursday that Denmark, France, Germany, the Netherlands and the UK had joined with Canada in filing a ""declaration of intervention in the case."" The Maldives filed a separate declaration.

Under the court's rules, the declarations mean those countries will be able to make legal arguments in the case brought in 2019 following international outrage at the treatment of the Rohingya, a Muslim minority. Hundreds of thousands fled to neighboring Bangladesh amid a brutal crackdown by Burmese forces.

ETHNIC REBELS CLAIM ENTIRE BURMESE ARMY BATTALION HAS SURRENDERED TO THEM

Gambia argued that it and Burma are both parties to the 1948 convention outlawing genocide and that all signatories have a duty to ensure it is enforced. It asked the court to declare Burma in breach of the convention.

The court has already ruled it has jurisdiction, though hearings in the case have not been scheduled.

More than 700,000 Rohingya fled into neighboring Bangladesh. Myanmar security forces have been accused of mass rapes, killings and torching thousands of Rohingya homes.

Burma tried unsuccessfully to have the case thrown out, arguing the world court can only hear disputes between nations and Gambia was acting on behalf of the Organization of Islamic Cooperation.

The judges also dismissed Burma's claim that Gambia could not file the case as it was not directly linked to the events in Burma and that a legal dispute did not exist between the two countries before the case was filed.

Then new ones formed.,"The suspensions didn't have their intended effect. New organizations quickly formed.

The emergence of new groups to supplant suspended ones is confounding colleges as they try to find a line between allowing protests that support a ceasefire in the Israel-Hamas war with those devolving into hate speech.

At Columbia, ""the suspension of those two groups is nothing more than a suppression of speech,"" said one Palestinian student who is a member of a new coalition, Columbia University Apartheid Divest, and declined to give his full name for fear of retribution.

Schools like Brown University and MIT have also disciplined students for expressing solidarity with Palestinians. The Biden administration, meanwhile, this week unveiled new actions and resources to address the rise in antisemitic and Islamophobic incidents at schools and on college campuses.

""For many years, we saw increasingly toxic environments on campus poisoned by anti-Israel and antisemitic rhetoric,"" said Kenneth Marcus, founder and chair of the Brandeis Center, a nonprofit that advances Jewish civil and human rights. ""But now, over the last month, we have seen student groups who are going so far as to provide support for a designated terrorist organization in the wake of atrocities that they have committed.""

Students, activists and free speech advocates are sounding the alarm on efforts to silence pro-Palestinian groups. And institutions are becoming more cognizant of that: Two of Florida's biggest universities have declined to deactivate Students for Justice in Palestine groups as requested by Gov. Ron DeSantis due to legal concerns.

The Students for Justice in Palestine chapter at one of those schools, the University of Florida, also sued the institution Thursday as well as the state, alleging that its First Amendment rights were being violated. But Republican lawmakers are also looking to take away scholarships and grants from Florida college students who ""promote"" Hamas and other designated terrorist organizations.

The American Civil Liberties Union wrote an open letter to roughly 650 college leaders to reject ""baseless calls to investigate or punish"" pro-Palestinian groups protesting on campuses. That came in response to a letter the American Defamation League and the Brandeis Center sent to nearly 200 college leaders urging them to probe Students for Justice in Palestine chapters.

Afaf Nasher, executive director of the New York chapter of the Council on American-Islamic Relations, the nation's largest Muslim civil rights group, called Columbia's decision ""the suppression and silencing of pro-Palestinian voices on campus.""

There was more pushback this week.

Thirteen bar associations representing more than 1,000 attorneys -- including the American Muslim Bar Association -- on Monday sent a letter to 100 of the country's top law firms urging them to address Islamophobia and hate speech.

The letter was a response to a missive law firms sent to law school deans requesting they address antisemitism.

The pro-Israel law firms' letter ""unfortunately missed the opportunity to equally express concern for members of the Palestinian and Muslim communities who have been experiencing significant discrimination, harassment, silencing, hate, violence, and fear in the current social climate,"" the Muslim groups wrote.

And the protests persist.

Law Students for a Free Palestine -- a coalition of students from over 30 law schools, including Harvard, Columbia, New York University and the City University of New York -- was holding a day of action Thursday to urge law schools to advocate for an end to violence in Gaza and support a ceasefire.

Student organizations at George Washington also established a new group, Student Coalition for Palestine.

Colleges' ability to crack down on protests, however, gets into a gray area of the law.

Lyrissa Lidsky, the chair of the constitutional law program at the University of Florida, said the Supreme Court has held that free speech is protected unless it falls in an unprotected category -- like material support of a foreign terrorist organization or incitement to imminent violent actions.

Some of the suspensions or banning of pro-Palestinian organizations are problematic because they're being prohibited solely for advocacy, she argued. But she cautioned private universities are not required to uphold the First Amendment in the same way as public schools.

""Brandeis can do what it wants, Columbia can do what it wants,"" Lidsky said in an interview. ""They may take a reputational hit from engaging in censorship and they may violate their expressed ideals, but they don't violate the First Amendment. But a state university like mine has to adhere to the First Amendment, and they can't suppress those groups just because they find their speech offensive.""

Institutions have targeted Students for Justice in Palestine long before the current conflict in the Middle East. Earlier this year, Lafayette College in Pennsylvania refused to recognize a local chapter over concerns the group's events could flout college policy by targeting other clubs on campus. Fordham University previously banned the group, too.

Amid an increase in threats, harassment and assaults -- including a 21-year-old Cornell University student arrested for making online threats to Jewish students -- schools have been facing pressure to take action.

Fareed, a student at Columbia's School of International and Public Affairs -- who asked to be identified by his first name for safety reasons -- said the tension in the school community is ""still polarizing,"" but accused outside actors of labeling the internal tension ""as more than what it is.""

""If Students for Justice in Palestine and Jewish Voice for [Peace] are shut down, then whatever perspective that they have -- correct or incorrect, depending on who's listening to it -- you lose that opportunity to have a real conversation,"" he said.

Brandeis' President Ron Liebowitz said last week it is committed to ensuring free speech, but the university ""may restrict expression ... that constitutes a genuine threat or harassment.""

And in a recent Boston Globe op-ed, he contended that student organizations that call for violence against Jews or the annihilation of Israel ""should lose all privileges associated with affiliation at their schools.""

In a statement, George Washington said Students for Justice in Palestine's actions violated university policies, including building use guidelines and non-compliance when it wouldn't stop projecting images on the library building.

In a joint statement last week, the Columbia chapters of Students for Justice in Palestine and Jewish Voice for Peace called the announcement ""an attack on free speech"" to distract from and enable ""Israel's genocidal campaign against the Palestinian people.""

Colleges are also under threat of losing state aid if they don't clamp down on hate speech, like what is being pursued in Florida.

New York state Sen. Bill Weber, a Republican, introduced legislation that would prohibit New York college students who knowingly engage in antisemitic behavior from receiving tuition assistance aid.

""There is no room for hate in New York, and it is our duty to put an end to this divisive behavior,"" he said.","{'uri': 'politico.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'POLITICO'}",[],https://static.politico.com/2c/7c/1bb6cac446f1a3c83bace64bb61e/ap23287817661676-1.jpg,eng-9065381,-0.1529411764705882,25,25,POLITICO,politico.com

Convicted criminals in New York will now have their records sealed after Gov. Kathy Hochul signed into law the ""Clean State Act"" on Thursday.

The controversial proposal would seal old criminal records as long as the perpetrators remain out of trouble for a certain number of years.

Under the new law in New York, a person's felony records would be sealed eight years after conviction or release from prison; three years for a misdemeanor.

Sex crimes and most Class A felonies, such as kidnapping or terrorism, will not be eligible for the program. The bill excludes class A felonies for drug possession.

During the signing of the controversial law, Gov. Hochul hailed the program for its potential to fight rising crime.

""The best crime-fighting tool is a good-paying job,"" Hochul said at the Brooklyn Museum on Thursday morning. ""That's why I support giving New Yorkers a clean slate after they've paid their debt to society and gone years without an additional offense.""

Melinda Agnew with the Center for Community Alternative said that the legislation will change lives.

""Twenty-six years after successfully completing my sentence, despite all that I have accomplished, I continue to have doors closed in my face,"" said Agnew.

The law, which will go into effect in one year, will still allow law enforcement, prosecutors, the Education Department, the courts and others to have access to perpetrators' records.

HOCHUL SAYS NEW YORK TO INVEST IN 3 OFFSHORE WIND PROJECTS

""I negotiated a compromise that protects public safety and boosts economic opportunity, and the final Clean Slate Law will help New Yorkers access jobs and housing while allowing police, prosecutors and school officials to protect their communities,"" Hochul said.

The governor said that the law hopes to address the worker shortage plaguing New York.

""And as our state faces a worker shortage, with more than 450,000 job openings right now, this new law will help businesses find more workers who will help them grow, expand and thrive,"" Hochul said.

The bill was passed by state lawmakers last June on a party-line vote.

Former New York Democratic Gov. David Paterson has denounced the law, saying that that while he thinks the ""intent"" was positive, he believes the measure is misguided.

""In theory, it works. But one of the problems we have in the state right now is you have people getting arrested 40, 50, 60 times.

The driver failed to stop and fled, striking two patrol cars. He continued several streets before entering westbound I-94.

The pursuit ended when the man encountered traffic on the freeway near Woodward Avenue and the median wall. The driver also intentionally struck other vehicles not involved in the chase, according to police.

Michigan State Police say Warren police officer fired shots. The man was taken to a hospital in serious condition. One officer suffered a non-fatal injury.

The incident led to lane closures on westbound I-94 at southbound I-75. Those lanes have since reopened.

(AP) - The top health official in one of Michigan´s largest counties is asking a judge to uphold a $4 million settlement in exchange for her resignation, coming after months of conflict with local conservative leaders who were elected in response to COVID-19 restrictions.

Ottawa County leaders had attempted to fire Adeline Hambley in January after they took majority control of the county´s board of commissioners. Finding themselves unable to, the board opted to offer her $4 million - equivalent to a quarter of the health department´s 2024 budget - in return for her resignation. She also would have had to drop her lawsuit against the county.

The board backed off the offer, saying it was only a ""tentative settlement agreement."" David Kallman, the county's legal counsel, told The Associated Press that ""there has never been an agreement by the board to accept the $4 million. There were discussions.""

But Hambley's lawyer filed a motion Thursday to enforce the settlement, and it's scheduled to go in front of a judge on Nov. 27.

""The parties agreed to settle this matter on Nov. 6, 2023. Now, defendants have remorse and want out of the deal,"" Hambley´s lawyer, Sarah Riley-Howard, wrote in the filing.

Public health officials and local health departments across the country became political targets during the pandemic due to lockdowns and restrictions.

Ottawa County's health department serves 300,000 residents in the western part of the state. Earlier this year, county commissioners voted to cut the department´s upcoming budget by nearly $4 million. The board had threatened deeper cuts, and Hambley took to social media to protest.

The county's 11-member board of commissioners was transformed last year when eight incumbents were defeated by a slate of challengers tied closely to a group known as Ottawa Impact, which was formed in 2021 partly in response to mask mandates in the county.

Hambley sued the commissioners earlier this year for ""termination in violation of public policy."" In October, the state´s appeals court ruled Hambley could be fired only for ""just cause.""

But following a nearly eight-hour closed session at a Nov. 6 meeting, commissioners voted to ""accept counsel´s recommendation regarding litigation and settlement activities"" regarding Hambley. The settlement was later revealed to be $4 million, in return for Hambley´s resignation.

Hambley would work until at least Nov. 30 but no later than Dec. 15 under the agreement.

Nathaniel Kelly, a safety manager at an HVAC company and who has no public health experience, is in line to take over the county health department.

The county requested approval from the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services for Kelly to serve as acting health officer, but the state told the county it couldn´t appoint a health officer until a vacancy exists, according to a spokesperson with the department.

Telesforo Del Valle, 65, pleaded guilty to charges of conspiracy, bribery, paying illegal compensation to a court employee, and making material false statements to law enforcement to conceal his crimes. His trial had been set to begin on Dec. 4.

He potentially faces up to 15 years in prison. His sentencing has been scheduled for March 12, prosecutors said.

Prosecutors said Del Valle gave ""at least tens of thousands of dollars"" in payments to Dionisio Figueroa, who allegedly used his position as a clerk in the Southern District of New York court to encourage criminal defendants to hire Del Valle instead of using free, court-appointed counsel.

""The public relies on attorneys and court employees to maintain and validate its faith in our criminal justice system,"" Manhattan U.S. Attorney Damian Williams said in a statement. Del Valle betrayed that trust, he added.

Del Valle's lawyer did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Figueroa, 66, was also charged and is still scheduled to go to trial on Dec. 4, according to federal court records.

""Mr. Del Valle has great lawyers, and I am sure his own reasons for pleading guilty just as Mr. Figueroa has his reasons for vigorously pursuing his innocence at a trial,"" Paul Evangelista and Jeremy Sporn, federal public defenders representing Figueroa, said in an email.

Figueroa allegedly referred at least 45 criminal defendants to Del Valle as possible clients from 2011 to 2022, and at least 20 ended up retaining him. In return, Del Valle gave Figueroa referral payments in cash, prosecutors said.

Prosecutors alleged Figueroa vouched for Del Valle when talking with defendants or their families as they appeared in court.

Figueroa was charged with conspiracy to bribe a federal employee and pay illegal compensation to a judicial employee, bribery of a federal employee, illegal compensation to a judicial employee, and making false statements to law enforcement.

Donald Trump got his New York gag order lifted while he challenges it on appeal, meaning that, at least for now, he's free from such restraints in both his civil fraud case and the federal election interference case in Washington.

The lifting by a New York state appellate judge on Thursday follows a similar move from the federal appeals court in D.C. that's considering Trump's gag order there. Oral arguments are set for Monday at the Washington appeals court, and the gag orders could wind up reinstated in both cases after more litigation plays out.

It's worth noting that the New York order imposed by Judge Arthur Engoron was more limited than the one in D.C. The New York order applies specifically to comments about court staff, sparked by Trump's social media posting about Engoron's law clerk, whom Trump and his lawyers have contrived as a foil in the $250 million fraud case that threatens his business empire. Engoron has already fined Trump twice for violating the gag order, for a relatively meager $15,000 total, and later extended the order to Trump's lawyers. The pause applies to both Trump and his lawyers.

Again, this is a temporary measure, so we don't know how this will conclude on appeal.

Austin Lee Edwards, 28, died by suicide during a shootout with law enforcement on Nov. 25, hours after the violence in Riverside, a city about 50 miles (80 kilometers) southeast of downtown Los Angeles. The teenager was rescued.

Edwards had been hired as a Washington County sheriff's deputy in Virginia just nine days before the killings, even though a 2016 court order prohibited him from buying, possessing and transporting a firearm. The court order stemmed from a psychiatric detention after Edwards cut himself and threatened to kill his father.

The girl´s aunt, Mychelle Blandin, and her minor sister filed the lawsuit Thursday in federal court in the Central District of California against the Washington County Sheriff´s Office and Edwards´ estate. The lawsuit says the department was negligent in hiring Edwards and seeks damages through a jury trial. The sheriff's office did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Authorities have said Edwards had posed online as a 17-year-old boy while communicating with the teenager, a form of deception known as ""catfishing,"" and asked her to send nude photos of herself.

The girl stopped responding to his messages, prompting Edwards to travel across the country to her home in California. The lawsuit alleges that he showed his law enforcement badge and service weapon to Mark Winek and Sharon Winek, the girl's grandparents, and said he was a detective and needed to question the family.

The suit says Edwards slit the throat of the teen's mother, Brooke Winek, and tried to asphyxiate her grandparents by tying them up with bags over their heads. At least one of them was still moving when he set their home on fire, the lawsuit says.

Blandin said the killings ""destroyed our family.""

""I am bringing this lawsuit because my family wants to know how Edwards was hired as a sheriff´s deputy and given a gun when the courts expressly ordered he could not possess a firearm,"" Blandin said in a statement. ""He used his position as a sheriff to gain access to my parents´ home, where he killed them and my sister. I want the Washington County Sheriff´s Office held accountable for giving a mentally unfit person a badge and a gun.""

Edwards was hired by the Virginia State Police in July 2021 and resigned nine months later. He was then hired as a deputy in Washington County last year.

The slayings - and their connection to Virginia - prompted Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin to ask the state´s inspector general for a ""full investigation,"" which found that a background investigator for the state police failed to check the correct database that would have pulled up the mental health order.

The state police, which is not listed as a defendant in the lawsuit, has since changed its employment processes and background investigation policies and training.

A spokesperson for the state police did not immediately respond to a request for comment Thursday.","{'uri': 'dailymail.co.uk', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'Daily Mail Online'}",[],,eng-9069061,-0.4431372549019608,25,25,Daily Mail Online,dailymail.co.uk

Please try again later{{ /verifyErrors }}

Sacked home secretary Suella Braverman has been accused of wanting to do 'what Putin and Xi do' in her latest bid to ensure deportation flights to Rwanda can take off.

Mrs Braverman, dismissed during a reshuffle this week, has said the prime minister's proposals to overcome the Supreme Court's verdict that the Rwanda policy is unlawful is unlikely to succeed in removing asylum seekers before the next election.

She predicts Mr Sunak's two-part plan would likely get bogged down in both domestic and European courts as she proposed introducing legislation that ""excludes all avenues of legal challenge"".

In an article for The Daily Telegraph, Mrs Braverman said a 'solution' to the challenge of stopping migrants crossing the English Channel ""demands of the Government an end to self-deception and spin"".

""There must be no more magical thinking,"" she writes. ""Tinkering with a failed plan will not stop the boats.""

Mrs Braverman argues that ""amending our agreement with Rwanda and converting it into a treaty, even with explicit obligations on non-refoulement, will not solve the fundamental issue"".

Instead, she proposes that ministers address concerns raised by the five senior judges about Rwanda's asylum and legal system by ""embedding UK observers and independent reviewers of asylum decisions"".

New legislation should be laid in Westminster to ""exclude all avenues of legal challenge"" so that international obligations, such as the Human Rights Act and the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR), are ""disapplied by way of clear 'notwithstanding clauses'"", she said.

The right-wing Conservative also suggested Parliament sit over Christmas to ensure the new emergency law can be passed before next year. The Fareham MP said a new treaty with Rwanda would ""still require going back through the courts"", a process that she predicted could take at least a year.

And even a victory in domestic courts would only mean the ""saga would simply relocate to Strasbourg where the European court would take its time deciding if it liked our laws"", she added.

""That is why the plan outlined by the PM will not yield flights to Rwanda before an election if Plan B is simply a tweaked version of the failed Plan A,"" said the former Home Office chief.

Her proposals were quickly met with criticism, even from her own party, as the Conservatives continue to be divided by her hardline approach.

MP Ashford for Damian Green wrote on X on Thursday evening: ""The second test is the most unconservative statement I have ever heard from a Conservative politician. Giving the state the explicit power to override every legal constraint is what Putin and Xi do. We absolutely cannot go there.""

Mr Sunak's response to the Supreme Court judgment on Wednesday saw him announce that his administration plans to lay down emergency legislation to have Parliament deem Rwanda a ""safe"" country.

Mrs Braverman, who was dismissed during a reshuffle this week, said the Prime Minister's proposals to overcome the Supreme Court's verdict that the Rwanda policy is unlawful is unlikely to succeed in removing asylum seekers before the next election.

She predicted that Rishi Sunak's two-part plan would likely get bogged down in both domestic and European courts as she proposed introducing legislation that ""excludes all avenues of legal challenge"".

Tinkering with a failed plan will not stop the boats Suella Braverman

In an article for The Daily Telegraph, Mrs Braverman said a solution to the challenge of stopping migrants crossing the English Channel ""demands of the Government an end to self-deception and spin"".

""There must be no more magical thinking. Tinkering with a failed plan will not stop the boats,"" she said.

Mr Sunak's response to the Supreme Court judgment on Wednesday saw him announce that his administration plans to lay down emergency legislation to have Parliament deem Rwanda a ""safe"" country.

He also intends to broker a new legally binding treaty on top of the £140 million deal already struck with Kigali to take migrants arriving in Britain via small boats.

The yet-to-be-published treaty with Rwanda is expected to attempt to address the Supreme Court's concerns around refoulement - the potential for refugees whose applications for asylum are rejected by Kigali to be sent back to the country they are fleeing from.

Suella Braverman said the Prime Minister´s 'tinkering´ with the Rwanda policy was likely to end up back in the courts (James Manning/PA)

But Mrs Braverman, in her newspaper article, said that ""amending our agreement with Rwanda and converting it into a treaty, even with explicit obligations on non-refoulement, will not solve the fundamental issue"".

Instead, she proposed that ministers address concerns raised by the five senior judges about Rwanda's asylum and legal system by ""embedding UK observers and independent reviewers of asylum decisions"".

New legislation should be laid in Westminster to ""exclude all avenues of legal challenge"" so that international obligations, such as the Human Rights Act and the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR), are ""disapplied by way of clear 'notwithstanding clauses'"", she said.

The right-wing Conservative also suggested Parliament sit over Christmas to ensure the new emergency law can be passed before next year.

The Fareham MP said a new treaty with Rwanda would ""still require going back through the courts"", a process that she predicted could take at least a year.

And even a victory in domestic courts would only mean the ""saga would simply relocate to Strasbourg where the European court would take its time deciding if it liked our laws"", she added.

Prime Minister Rishi Sunak has committed to stopping the boats ahead of the next election (Gareth Fuller/PA)

""That is why the plan outlined by the PM will not yield flights to Rwanda before an election if Plan B is simply a tweaked version of the failed Plan A,"" said the former Home Office chief.

The Prime Minister has said he is aiming for the first removal flights to leave in the spring following the delivery of the reforms to his flagship policy.

But Chancellor Jeremy Hunt refused to commit to migrants who arrive via unauthorised means being sent to the east African country in 2024.

Speaking to broadcasters on Thursday, Mr Hunt said: ""We are hopeful that because of the solutions that the Prime Minister announced yesterday we will be able to get flights off to Rwanda next year.

""We can't guarantee that.""

New Home Secretary James Cleverly, during broadcast interviews on Thursday, said he was ""absolutely determined"" to get a removal flight off the runway before the next election.

A general election is expected to be held next year, with Mr Sunak needing to call a vote by January 2025.

The British leader has made ""stopping the boats"" one of his five pledges to the electorate ahead of the next election.

The threat of being deported to Rwanda has been regularly touted by the Conservative Party leader and other senior Government figures as one of the ways that can help deliver the commitment.

The new treaty with Kigali could be published as soon as Monday, with the emergency legislation tabled a week later, according to The Guardian.

The Government's next steps on the Rwanda policy is expected to face opposition to its plans in the House of Lords.

Lord Sumption, a former Supreme Court judge, told the BBC the plan to use a law to declare Rwanda as safe is ""constitutionally really quite extraordinary"" and would ""effectively overrule"" a decision by the UK's highest court.

Under pressure from the right of the party, Mr Sunak has kept the threat of pulling out of the ECHR on the table for the future in his battle to deport migrants.

Mrs Braverman, however, did not call for such action in her five tests.","{'uri': 'dailymail.co.uk', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'Daily Mail Online'}",[],https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2023/11/16/22/wire-77906215-1700175230-621_636x382.jpg,eng-9063836,0.1607843137254903,25,25,Daily Mail Online,dailymail.co.uk

Please try again later{{ /verifyErrors }}

The Republican attorney general in Kansas is appealing a state judge's ruling that has blocked enforcement of multiple abortion restrictions, including a new limit on medication and an older rule forcing patients to wait 24 hours before they can get the procedure.

Attorney General Kris Kobach filed a notice Thursday in Johnson County District Court in the Kansas City area, saying he will ask higher courts to overturn Judge K. Christopher Jayaram's decision last month. The judge concluded that abortion providers were likely to successfully argue in a lawsuit that the restrictions violate the Kansas Constitution.

""The attorney general has a responsibility to protect women against radicals who want to deny them the ability to make informed decisions about their own health and the welfare of their babies,"" Kobach spokesperson Danedri Herbert said in an email.

Jayaram's order is set to remain in effect through a trial of the providers' lawsuit at the end of June 2024. Some of the blocked restrictions have been in place for years. The state imposed its waiting period in 1997.

The newest restriction, in place July 1, required providers to tell patients that a medication abortion can be stopped. But the regimen to do that has been described by major medical groups as inadequately tested, ineffective and potentially unsafe.

The legal battle in Kansas highlights the importance of state courts in attempts to preserve access after the U.S. Supreme Court's decision in Dobbs v. Jackson last year ended protections under the U.S. Constitution and allowed states to ban abortion.

The Kansas Supreme Court ruled in 2019 that the state constitution protects access to abortion as a ""fundamental"" right. In August 2022, voters statewide rejected a proposed constitutional change from Republican lawmakers to nullify that decision and allow greater restrictions or a ban.

Abortion opponents argue that even with last year's vote, the state can impose ""reasonable"" restrictions and ensure that patients are well-informed.

But Jayaram concluded there is ""credible evidence"" that up to 40% of the information that clinics were required to provide before an abortion was medically inaccurate.

""Kansans made it clear they don't want politicians interfering with their health care decisions and the courts reaffirmed that right,"" said Anamarie Rebori-Simmons, spokesperson for Planned Parenthood Great Plains, which operates a Kansas City-area clinic that sued. ""The attorney general continues to disregard the will of those he serves.""","{'uri': 'independent.co.uk', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'The Independent'}",[],,eng-9069021,-0.192156862745098,25,25,The Independent,independent.co.uk

The 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals threw out a 3-2 decision issued last year by the National Labor Relations Board, which had said Tesla couldn´t prohibit union attire. The court opinion noted that Tesla allowed workers to affix ""any number or size"" of pro-union stickers to company-issued clothing.

""We may have concluded differently had Tesla prohibited union insignia,"" read the opinion issued Tuesday by a unanimous panel of three 5th Circuit judges.

The Associated Press sent emails requesting comment to Tesla and the UAW.

According to the court record, Tesla issued special black clothing with the company name and logo, dubbed ""Team Wear,"" to employees who worked on autos that had been recently painted. The clothing is issued to help prevent workers from inadvertently causing damage to paint that hasn't completely cured.

Some employees began wearing UAW shirts as an alternative in 2017, a practice the company cracked down on after several months, according to the opinion.

The NLRB ruled in August 2022 that the practice was an ""overly broad"" uniform policy and ordered it stopped.

But the appeals panel said the company policy didn't keep the union from getting its message across to employees.

""The Team Wear policy - or any hypothetical company´s uniform policy - advances a legitimate interest of the employer and neither discriminates against union communication nor affects nonworking time,"" Judge Jerry Smith wrote for the panel.

The opinion comes as the 5th Circuit prepares for arguments in another union-related matter involving Tesla, NLRB and the assembly plant in Fremont, California.

A 5th Circuit panel ruled in March that Tesla CEO Elon Musk unlawfully threatened to take away employees´ stock options in a 2018 post on what was then Twitter amid an organizing effort by the UAW. The post was made before Musk bought the platform and renamed it X.

The panel upheld an NLRB order to delete the tweet. But that order was vacated after the full 5th Circuit, currently with 16 full-time judges, voted to hear the matter. A hearing in that case is pending.

The panel that issued this week's ruling included Smith, nominated to the appeals court by the late President Ronald Reagan; Leslie Southwick, nominated by former President George W. Bush; and Stephen Higginson, nominated by former President Barack Obama.","{'uri': 'dailymail.co.uk', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'Daily Mail Online'}",[],https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2023/11/16/22/wire-77905023-1700173281-929_636x382.jpg,eng-9064471,0.05098039215686279,25,25,Daily Mail Online,dailymail.co.uk

Law firm revenue grew by 4.6% during the first nine months of 2023, while net income grew by 2.7%, according to data from Wells Fargo's Legal Specialty Group. Its survey of more than 120 firms included 65 of the 100 highest-grossing U.S. firms.

The revenue increases were driven by ""some of the highest growth in billing rates we've seen,"" Wells Fargo said. Rates grew by 7.9% overall for the surveyed firms.

Expenses grew by 5.6% during the first nine months of 2023, Wells Fargo found, compared with 12.8% growth during the first nine months of 2022.

A nine-month survey from Citigroup's Citi Global Wealth at Work Law Firm Group had similar findings. Revenue for the nearly 200 law firms Citi surveyed grew by 4.8%, as did expenses.

The gains were not evenly shared, however. Only the 50 highest-grossing U.S. law firms as ranked by trade publication The American Lawyer saw a growth in net income--a measure of a firm's profitability--Wells Fargo reported.

The data provide a glimpse into the firms' balance sheets as associates wait to learn about year-end bonuses and whether they may receive a salary bump in line with increases announced last week by New York law firm Milbank.

First-year associates at Milbank will see their base pay jump from $215,000 to $225,000 under the firm's new seniority-based salary scale, according to an internal memo viewed by Reuters. The scale for eighth-year associates will top out at $425,000.

So far, no law firm has publicly said they will match or exceed Milbank's associate salary increases or year-end bonus, which ranges from a pro-rated $15,000 to $115,000, based on seniority. The country's biggest law firms typically adjust their salary scales within days or weeks of one another to remain competitive.

The apparent reluctance to raise salaries is not surprising, Wells Fargo consultants said. Along with associates, any increases would extend to counsel and non-equity partners as well, said Owen Burman, a senior consultant at Wells Fargo's Legal Specialty Group.

""It's an unplanned expense they were not expecting,"" Burman said. ""They were raising rates to support all of the other costs that are increasing across the industry.""

Highly profitable law firms will have the capacity to match Milbank's salary increases, but it might be difficult for others, Burman said. Net income rose by 5.2% for the top 50 firms, while shrinking slightly for law firms ranked 51 through 100, Wells Fargo found.

Law firms 101 through 200 in the American Lawyer's revenue rankings saw their net income shrink by 3.7% during the first nine months of 2023, according to Wells Fargo.

""The Second Hundred really does not show any capacity to absorb any kind of additional cost pressure,"" especially until they know they can collect outstanding client invoices, Burman said.

Milbank's 2023 bonuses match what the firm gave last year. While other firms may follow suit, some may attach billable hours requirements, said Stephanie Biderman of legal recruiting firm Major, Lindsey & Africa.

Some firms have always had an hours requirement, but there may be fewer associates who qualify for the bonuses because their billable hours are down, she said.

It also remains to be seen whether other top firms will match Milbank's new salary scale - or possibly exceed it.

""A lot of firms are in a holding pattern to see what peer firms are going to do,"" she said.","{'uri': 'reuters.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'Reuters'}","[{'uri': 'sara_merken@reuters.com', 'name': 'Sara Merken', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': False}, {'uri': 'david_thomas@reuters.com', 'name': 'David Thomas', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': False}]",https://www.reuters.com/resizer/FnONJeYVX43FmAW-ztGSBwuIZOE=/728x381/smart/filters:quality(80)/cloudfront-us-east-2.images.arcpublishing.com/reuters/AG4LBNBJYNPC5FSWLXIG5O2I4Q.jpg,,0.3176470588235294,25,25,Reuters,reuters.com

In a unanimous ruling signed by Justice Karen Valihura, the Delaware Supreme Court said it agreed with a lower court that Bayer was not on the hook for lawsuits over sales of the products before the deal, in which Bayer acquired Merck's consumer care business including Dr. Scholl's foot powder, closed.

The lawsuits claim that asbestos contained in talc-based products such as Dr. Scholl's caused cancer.

Bayer said in a statement that it was pleased with the decision. Merck did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Vice Chancellor Nathan Cook of the Delaware Chancery Court ruled in April that the 2014 purchase agreement ""clearly and unambiguously"" left Merck liable for claims related to products sold before the transaction closed.

New Jersey-based Merck had claimed that its liability ended on Oct. 1, 2021, seven years after the transaction closed, and sued Bayer after the German company refused to assume liability. However, Cook said the 2021 date referred to separate indemnification obligations, and not to the talc lawsuits.

Bayer is separately fighting to fend off lawsuits over the weedkiller Roundup, which it acquired as part of its $63 billion purchase of agrochemical giant Monsanto in 2018. The company has said that decades of studies have shown Roundup and its active ingredient, glyphosate, are safe for human use.

In 2020, it settled most of the then-pending Roundup cases for up to $10.9 billion, but still faces more than 40,000. It recently lost three trials with verdicts totaling more than $500 million, following nine consecutive wins.

The case is Merck & Co Inc v. Bayer AG, Supreme Court of the State of Delware, No. 150, 2023.

""We fully hope and expect that the various Committees and the NCAA as a whole will do the right thing and allow JMU to compete in whatever bowl game its performance warrants,"" the letter says. Failing that, ""JMU is prepared to promptly file a lawsuit in the Western District of Virginia asserting that the bowl ban violates the antitrust and, potentially, other laws.""

In a statement, Attorney General Jason Miyares said the NCAA's denial of a waiver ""demonstrates yet again abject failures to act in the best interest of the nation's student-athletes. The NCAA has proven it is a broken institution which continues to make arbitrary and capricious decisions that are anti-competitive and have a profoundly negative impact on student-athletes, JMU, the Commonwealth of Virginia, collegiate football and athletes as a whole.""

Without a satisfactory resolution, Miyares said, ""I am prepared to expose the NCAA´s unlawful conduct and seek justice for James Madison University through litigation, provided the University authorize me to do so.""

In a statement Wednesday night from the Division I Board of Directors Administrative Committee, the committee said to two-year requirement is to allow programs moving up to ensure they have a sustainable plan beyond the playing field, such as infrastructure in place, adequate scholarship funding and medical and mental health resources.

""Division I members continually assess transition requirements, and the board continues to believe that if Division I members do not think the requirements are appropriate, those concerns should be addressed through rules changes rather than waiver requests,"" the statement said.

The committee also noted that James Madison and Jacksonville State, whose waiver request was also denied, might still have access to bowl games if there are not enough teams to meet the six-wins requirement to fill all slots.","{'uri': 'dailymail.co.uk', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'Daily Mail Online'}",[],,eng-9067184,-0.01960784313725494,25,25,Daily Mail Online,dailymail.co.uk

Right now, internet businesses that ship products nationwide can be sued on that basis in the 2nd, 7th and 9th Circuits, home to four of the five biggest cities in the U.S. But plaintiffs in the 5th and 8th Circuits, by contrast, can't establish jurisdiction solely by showing that an online retailer delivered a single product within the court's geographical boundaries.

That divide, according to several small companies that operate virtual storefronts on Amazon's website, is untenable in an era of explosive growth in online commerce. The companies' lawyers at Bochner have asked the U.S. Supreme Court to step in to resolve the circuit split and provide clear guidance on where internet retailers can be sued.

Specifically, Bochner's clients are seeking Supreme Court review of a ruling last summer by the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, which held that Arizona had jurisdiction over trademark infringement claims against the Amazon (AMZN.O) storefronts because the online retailers sold and delivered products to purchasers in Arizona.

Bochner's clients, led by a company called Photoplaza, framed the question presented in their petition as whether a seller whose products ship across the country ""is subject to personal jurisdiction in every forum into which even one of its products is shipped."" But to be fair, the 9th Circuit, as I told you when the ruling came down, did not specifically say that the delivery of a single product is sufficient to establish jurisdiction.

The appeals court instead instructed trial judges to focus on whether the sale and delivery of physical products within the plaintiff's chosen jurisdiction are a routine part of the online retailer's business. In the trademark case against the Amazon resellers, the appeals court said, the plaintiff -- health and wellness company Herbal Brands -- adequately alleged that the Amazon storefronts routinely shipped allegedly infringing products to Arizona customers.

It's even easier for plaintiffs in the 2nd and 7th Circuits to establish jurisdiction for lawsuits against internet retailers. The 2nd Circuit explicitly held in 2010's Chloe v. Queen Bee of Beverly Hills LLC that the single act of shipping an allegedly counterfeit handbag to New York was sufficient to give New York courts jurisdiction. The 7th Circuit's 2022 ruling on the jurisdictional issue, in NBA Properties, Incorporated v. HANWJH, also centered on the delivery of a single product, a pair of allegedly counterfeit NBA shorts.

Neither the 2nd Circuit nor the 7th Circuit was swayed by defense arguments that the plaintiffs themselves had manufactured jurisdiction by ordering the allegedly infringing products whose delivery established their right to sue.

On the other side of the circuit divide, the 8th Circuit held in 2022 that the delivery of a single T-shirt with an allegedly infringing logo was not enough to give Missouri courts jurisdiction over a trademark case. The 5th Circuit expressed the same view, albeit in dicta, in a 2021 decision describing the shipment of a lone product as ""the type of isolated act that does not create minimum contact.""

The Amazon resellers' certiorari petition argued that the 5th and 8th Circuits' analysis is faithful to Supreme Court precedent -- and that the reasoning of the 2nd, 7th and 9th Circuits is not.

The petition homed in on a pair of Supreme Court cases decided on the same day in 1984: Keeton v. Hustler Magazine, Inc., and Calder v. Jones.

Both cases involved jurisdictional challenges in libel suits against publications with nationwide circulations. In Keeton, the Supreme Court allowed a New York resident to sue Hustler magazine in New Hampshire (which has an unusually long statute of limitations for libel claims) because Hustler ""continuously and deliberately exploited the New Hampshire market"" by circulating the magazine in the state. In Calder, the justices ruled that actress Shirley Jones could sue the Florida-based National Enquirer in California because California, where Jones lived and worked, was the ""focal point"" of the alleged libel.

The two decisions, in tandem, offer ""clear rules"" on personal jurisdiction against non-resident defendants, the Amazon resellers said in their Supreme Court petition. When a defendant routinely ships thousands of products into a particular forum, that forum's courts have jurisdiction under Keeton. Otherwise, the petition said, courts must apply the Calder ""effects test"" to determine if the defendant's conduct was specifically aimed at the jurisdiction in which it has been sued.

The Amazon storefronts' petition asserted that isolated sales and deliveries are insufficient to establish jurisdiction under either Keeton or Calder precedent.

Herbal Brands counsel Daniel Wucherer of Vorys Sater, who argued for the company at the 9th Circuit, did not respond to my email query on the Supreme Court petition. But the 9th Circuit, in applying the Calder test, said Herbal Brands demonstrated that the Amazon storefronts had ""expressly aimed"" conduct at Arizona by routinely selling and delivering products in the state.

The Amazon resellers' petition is not the first to ask the Supreme Court to resolve the circuit split on where online retailers can be sued. The China-based online retailer in the 7th Circuit's NBA case filed a petition for certiorari last November. NBA Properties did not file a response. The Supreme Court declined to hear the case in January.

The Amazon storefronts argued in the new petition that the 9th Circuit's ruling widened and deepened the divide among the circuits on the issue of jurisdiction for claims against online retailers. They also emphasized the urgency of the issue as e-commerce becomes increasingly popular.

""Considering that Amazon and other e-commerce websites offer nationwide shipping, the 9th Circuit's rule extinguishes e-commerce sellers' due process rights and subjects them to jurisdiction in every state in the Union,"" said Serge Krimnus of Bochner, counsel of record for the storefronts, in an email statement. ""We hope the Supreme Court grants certiorari; applies the rule of the 5th and 8th Circuits; and reaffirms its decision in Calder v. Jones.""

Sunrise host Nat Barr has grilled a Labor politician over the government's rushed introduction of laws overnight to monitor 84 hardened criminals released into the community after a High Court ruling.

The nation's highest court ruled indefinite immigration detention is unlawful and detainees must be released, prompting Labor's emergency laws this week which include mandatory ankle bracelets and curfews.

Three of those released are murderers, one of whom killed a pregnant woman in Malaysia, and another was previously jailed for raping a 10-year-old boy in Sydney.

Education Minister Jason said on the program on Friday he had never seen laws passed so quickly in his 16 years in Parliament, but Barr told him hardworking Aussies were not impressed with the cost of monitoring these offenders.

'Jason $180,000 every month. That's the estimate on top of the welfare payments, the housing. Can you understand why taxpayers are not happy,' Barr asked the minister.

'Yeah, I get it. But this is not about money. This is about safety.

'If we had our way, these people would still be looked up. But that's not an option. The High Court has ordered that these people be released. We had to do that.

'And that's why we had to pass these laws to make sure that we keep Australians safe.'

This prompted Barr to question why the government did not have a 'contingency plan' in place beforehand.

'Jason why did you just pass them yesterday? You, by your own admission argued very strongly against them being released but then these laws were rushed through yesterday. Why not before?' Barr said.

'You are putting a positive spin on this. This made your government look bad, didn't it, because it made you guys look flat-footed because you didn't pass these laws before it happened.

'You must have known it was a possibility. These murders and rapists could have got out.

Sunrise host Nat Barr labelled the government 'flat-footed' after rushing through laws following the High Court's ruling on indefinite detention

Minister for Education Jason Clare (centre) said he had never seen laws passed so quickly in his 16 years in Parliament

Mr Clare fired back arguing the process of legislation had to happen after the High Court's ruling.

'You have to make sure the laws are written to respond to the laws are written to respond to the decision of the High Court,' he said.

'Otherwise they don't work.

'The Australian people are dirty with this decision. If we had our way, these people would still be locked up.

The legislation passed in a late-night sitting of parliament on Thursday with amendments agreed to by the government and the coalition.

The bill, which has been fast-tracked through parliament, will impose conditions on former detainees such as ankle-tracking devices and curfews.

Under the amendments, electronic monitoring and curfews would be made mandatory, rather than being at the discretion of the immigration minister, while those affected would be banned from taking part in organised activity that involves children.

Former detainees would also be barred from being within 150 metres of a school or daycare centre, while those who have been convicted of sexual assault or violence offences would be able to have a no-contact condition placed on their visa.

Each visa breach would be considered a separate offence, with mandatory minimum sentences imposed.

'The good news is when the cameras have been turned off the two major parties Labor and Liberal have worked well behind- the-scenes over the course of this week to get this legislation in place,' Mr Clare explained.

'What it shows is when the Parliament wants to work it can work. It's done that over the last 24-hours.'

Immigration Minister Andrew Giles introduced the changes following the High Court decision last week that found indefinite detention was unlawful.

The laws will apply to the more than 80 detainees released since the High Court decision.

The opposition had been pushing the government on the potential threat posed by criminals, including three murderers and a number of sex offenders, who were released into the community.

Mr Giles said the safety of the community remained the highest priority.

'From the moment the High Court handed down its decision we have been implementing measures to keep the community safe,' he told parliament.

Opposition immigration spokesman Dan Tehan said the laws were a good first step following the High Court decision.

'We've taken significant some significant steps to keep the community safe. We still think there is further steps that need to be taken, but that's a debate now for another day,' he said.

Acting Prime Minister Richard Marles said the government agreed with the amendments in principle.

'The basis on which we are doing this is because we are in a position where this must be resolved immediately,' he told parliament.

Greens senator Sarah Hanson-Young criticised the amendments as an 'absolute disgrace', in addition to being an attack on democracy and the rule of law.

'I know there are members of the Labor Party who are hanging their heads in shame,' she said.

'They know that ramming this piece of legislation through is wrong, is immoral.'

Liberal senator James Paterson criticised Mr Albanese for dodging responsibility by jetting off overseas 'while criminals remain free to roam the streets'.

Prime Minister Anthony Albanese in currently in the USA for the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) Summit

Government Senate leader Penny Wong urged the opposition to stop 'playing politics' and pass the legislation as soon as possible to keep Australians safe.

Greens immigration spokesman Nick McKim said the 'draconian laws' would provide the minister with powers never before seen in Australia, and the passing of the legislation was a 'dark day'.

'It is an utter disgrace, an abject craven capitulation by a party (Labor) that has forgotten where it has come from, and forgotten what it used to stand for,' he said.

The laws would create a two-tiered justice system for some migrants and refugees in comparison with Australians, he said.

New visa requirements for the released detainees will force them to notify the government on a change of address, or any association with clubs or organisations or individuals involved in illegal activity.","{'uri': 'dailymail.co.uk', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'Daily Mail Online'}",[],https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2023/11/16/21/77900819-0-image-m-15_1700169031105.jpg,eng-9062211,-0.2235294117647059,25,25,Daily Mail Online,dailymail.co.uk

Suella Braverman has demanded Rishi Sunak cuts the spin and gets real about Rwanda, or risk another year of delay and defeats.

She says MPs' Christmas holiday must also be cancelled so they can sit and debate the new emergency legislation before the end of the year.

The demand is part of her new five-point plan to get the Rwanda deal sorted once and for all.

In an op-ed this evening, the former Home Secretary set out five key tests Mr Sunak's new emergency legislation must achieve in order for Rwanda to succeed.

After writing an incendiary letter to Rishi Sunak following her sacking, the former Home Secretary said she welcomed the Prime Minister's decision to push through emergency legislation to send those who come to Britain illegally to Rwanda.

However, she warns the Government must finally end the ""self-deception and spin"" in order to achieve its aims.

""There must be no more magical thinking. Tinkering with a failed plan will not stop the boats"".

Ms Braverman writes in the Telegraph that the fundamental question at stake is ""where does ultimate authority in the United Kingdom sit?""

""Is it with the British people and their elected representatives in Parliament?

""Or is it with the vague, shifting, and unaccountable concept of 'international law'?""

While Ms Braverman says there is no point in wasting energy ""on a post-mortem of how we got here"", she warns that the Government lost in the Supreme Court because judges determined Rwanda cannot be trusted to not send asylum seekers back to their home country.

She argues that Mr Sunak's primary plan of signing a new treaty with Rwanda will therefore make little difference.

In addition, she argues the Government cannot waste another year trying to push the policy through the courts.

""Considering the constitutional and statutory rights at issue an interim stay is granted,"" wrote Associate Justice David Friedman, of New York state's intermediate appeals court.

He issued the stay in response to a request filed by Trump's legal team earlier this week that argued the gag order violated his First-Amendment -- as well as the state's -- freedom-of-speech rights.

The gag order on the former president was imposed by Judge Arthur Engoron after a derogatory post appeared on Trump's Truth Social platform. He has fined Trump twice since then for violations, most recently for $10,000 after he made a remark outside the courtroom that Engoron concluded was made in reference to the judge's principal law clerk, Allison Greenfield.

Friedman's order also grants temporary relief to Trump's attorneys, who have also been prohibited by Judge Engoron from discussing his communications with his staff.

In a written order, Engoron wrote that Trump's attorneys have made ""repeated, inappropriate remarks about my Principal Law Clerk, falsely accusing her of bias against them and of improperly influencing"" the trial.

""Defendants' attorneys have made long speeches alleging that it is improper for a judge to consult with a law clerk during ongoing proceedings, and that the passing of notes from a judge to a law clerk, or vice-versa, constitutes an improper 'appearance of impropriety' in this case,"" he wrote. ""These arguments have no basis.""

On Wednesday, attorneys for Trump requested a mistrial be declared in the case, claiming the judge and his clerk have subjected the defendants to ""tangible and overwhelming"" bias and unfair treatment.

The motion for a mistrial makes good on a promise Trump's attorneys made to file it the day he testified in the case on Nov. 6. The announcement capped off an intense day of examination in which Trump -- who has frequently criticized Engoron and Greenfield -- even lashed out at the judge on the witness stand, pointing at him and calling him a ""fraud.""

Engoron is overseeing the case brought by New York Attorney General Letitia James against Trump, his two oldest sons, the Trump Organization and several executives in New York State Supreme Court in Manhattan. James' office alleges the defendants orchestrated a decade-long fraud scheme to inflate the value of the company's properties and Trump's personal wealth. Engoron has already found the Trumps and their company liable for business fraud.

The trial, which is related to other allegations in the suit, is currently in its seventh week. All defendants have denied wrongdoing.","{'uri': 'cbsnews.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'CBS News'}",[],https://assets1.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2023/11/09/510b25f2-3506-4196-9f56-a7f3ffad7168/thumbnail/1200x630/7da5f2cd84468f3a8272b87b2d6f1454/ap23312650378080.jpg?v=31b2603d647356ee899167281d5e1b87,eng-9065743,-0.1450980392156863,25,25,CBS News,cbsnews.com

A New York appeals court judge on Thursday paused a gag order that barred Donald Trump from commenting on court staffers in his civil fraud trial. The trial judge had imposed the gag order last month and later fined Trump $15,000 for violations after the former president made a disparaging social media post about a court clerk.

In his decision, Judge David Friedman of the state's intermediate appeals court cited constitutional concerns about restricting Trump's free speech. He issued a stay of the gag order, allowing Trump to comment freely about court staff while a longer appeals process plays out.

Trump's lawyers filed a lawsuit against the trial judge, Arthur Engoron, late Wednesday challenging the gag order as an abuse of power. Friedman scheduled an emergency hearing Thursday afternoon around a conference table in a state appellate courthouse a couple of miles from where the trial is unfolding.

Trump's lawyers had asked the appeals judge to scrap the gag order and fines imposed by the trial judge, after the former president and his attorneys claimed that a law clerk was wielding improper influence.

Trump and his lawyers have repeatedly put the law clerk, Allison Greenfield, under a microscope during the trial. They contend that the former Democratic judicial candidate is a partisan voice in Judge Engoron's ear - though he also is a Democrat - and that she is playing too big a role in the case involving the former Republican president.

Engoron has responded by defending Greenfield's role in the courtroom, ordering participants in the trial not to comment on court staffers and fining Trump a total of $15,000 for what the judge deemed violations. Engoron went on last week to prohibit attorneys in the case from commenting on ""confidential communications"" between him and his staff.

Trump's lawyers - who, separately, sought a mistrial Wednesday - contend that Engoron's orders are unconstitutionally suppressing free speech, and not just any free speech.

""This constitutional protection is at its apogee where the speech in question is core political speech, made by the frontrunner for the 2024 Republican presidential nomination, regarding perceived partisanship and bias at a trial where he is subject to hundreds of millions of dollars in penalties and the threatened prohibition of his lawful business activities in the state,"" they wrote in a legal filing.","{'uri': 'theguardian.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'The Guardian'}",[],https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f4ce09d4cf13d515e27a89e88a46bc747fd0527d/0_356_7485_4493/master/7485.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&s=bbf841f82b9426c1fbcf2b435bdceffc,eng-9065743,-0.2627450980392156,25,25,The Guardian,theguardian.com

The United Nations' top court on Thursday ordered the Syrian government to ""take all measures within its powers"" to prevent torture, in a case in which the Netherlands and Canada accuse Damascus of a years-long campaign of torturing its citizens.

The interim order is intended to protect potential victims while the case accusing Syria of breaching the torture convention proceeds through the International Court of Justice, a process likely to take years.

The court's President Joan E. Donoghue said the panel was ordering Damascus to ""take all measures within its power to prevent acts of torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment.""

The court also called on Syria to ""ensure that its officials, as well as any organizations or persons, may be subject to its control, direction or influence do not commit any acts of torture or other acts of cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment.""

The court further ordered Damascus to ""take effective measures to prevent the destruction and ensure the preservation of any evidence related to the allegations of acts within the scope"" of the convention against torture, O'Donoghue said.

Canada and the Netherlands last month called on the court to order the torture ban. Syria boycotted the hearing in October and it remains unclear how it will respond to the world court's orders.

Syria's conflict started with peaceful protests against Assad's government in March 2011 but quickly morphed into a full-blown civil war after the government's brutal crackdown on protesters. The tide turned in Assad's favour against rebel groups in 2015, when Russia provided key military backing to Syria, as well as Iran and the Lebanese militant group Hezbollah.

At the hearings last month, Canadian government lawyer Teresa Crockett urged the court to impose a binding order on Syria, warning that: ""If left unchecked, Syria will continue its violations"" of an international convention banning torture.

Human Rights Watch welcomed the ruling.

""With systematic and widespread torture still a reality in Syria, the implementation of this ruling will be a matter of life or death for many Syrians in detention centres across Syria,"" Balkees Jarrah, the rights group's associate international justice director, said in a statement.

""After over a decade of torture by the Syrian authorities, the World Court's order could be key to breaking the cycle of abuse and impunity that the world has watched in horror as it unfolded,"" Jarrah added, calling on other governments around the world to ""ensure that the court's order is enforced to stop future abuses and bring accountability.""

Orders by the court are legally binding but are not always adhered to by countries involved in proceedings. Last year, the judges issued such an order in another case calling on Moscow to cease hostilities in Ukraine.

The orders by the UN court Thursday came a day after French judicial authorities issued international arrest warrants for Syrian President Bashar Assad, his brother and two army generals for alleged complicity in war crimes and crimes against humanity related to the use of chemical weapons in Syria in 2013.","{'uri': 'euronews.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'Euronews English'}",[],https://static.euronews.com/articles/stories/08/04/60/48/1000x563_cmsv2_d65a77ca-865e-5d5c-b5ca-ddcf7be6044f-8046048.jpg,eng-9067706,-0.5764705882352941,25,25,Euronews English,euronews.com

The court's order rejects a request from Florida officials to narrow the scope of an injunction issued by a federal district judge in June to apply only to a restaurant in Orlando known as Hamburger Mary's, which challenged the constitutionality of the new law. Justices Clarence Thomas, Samuel Alito and Neil Gorsuch said they would have granted Florida's bid to allow the law to take effect against other establishments in the state.

At issue in the case is the Protection of Children Act, which Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis signed into law in May. DeSantis is seeking the 2024 Republican presidential nomination and has billed himself as a champion of ""parental rights,"" an issue that has grown in prominence among the GOP presidential field.

The law prohibits any person from knowingly admitting a child to an ""adult live performance,"" which is defined as a show that ""depicts or simulates nudity, sexual conduct, sexual excitement or specific sexual activities"" and is ""patently offensive to prevailing standards in the adult community"" regarding what is suitable for age of the child in attendance.

Establishments that don't comply with the law are subject to fines and can lose their liquor licenses. Violators can also be charged with a misdemeanor.

Hamburger Mary's, which hosted ""family friendly"" drag show performances, sued the state over the law, arguing it violates the First Amendment. The restaurant asked a federal district court to block enforcement of the measure while it considers its constitutionality.

A trial court agreed to stop the state from enforcing the law, finding Hamburger Mary's is likely to succeed on its claims that the measure does not comport with the First Amendment.

U.S. District Judge Gregory Presnell, who is overseeing the case, said in a June order that the law's language is likely overbroad and risks sweeping up protected speech through its enforcement. He also found that the prohibition on drag shows clashes with another law, Florida's ""Parents' Bill of Rights,"" which states that parents have the right to ""direct the upbringing and the moral or religious training"" of their child.

""Existing obscenity laws provide [the state] with the necessary authority to protect children from any constitutionally unprotected obscene exhibitions or shows,"" Presnell wrote. ""The harm to [Hamburger Mary's] clearly outweighs any purported evils not covered by Florida law and a preliminary injunction would not be adverse to the public interest.""

Florida officials asked a federal appeals court to partially pause the lower court's order to allow enforcement against all entities but Hamburger Mary's. But a divided three-judge panel on the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals denied the request.

The state then turned to the Supreme Court for emergency relief, arguing in a filing that the district court's decision ""inflicts irreparable harm on Florida and its children by purporting to erase from Florida's statute books a law designed to prevent the exposure of children to sexually explicit live performances.""

""As long as the district court's preliminary injunction remains in place, Florida is powerless to enforce a law its elected representatives have enacted for the protection of its children,"" Attorney General Ashley Moody told the court in her request.

In its own filing with the Supreme Court, Hamburger Mary's said that after Florida's restriction took effect, it had to place age restrictions on its drag show performances, leading to cancellations of its bookings.

The restaurant warned that many of the artists who perform at the establishment work in other venues across the state and would be forced to censor their performances to avoid violating Florida's law when appearing elsewhere if the injunction applied only to Hamburger Mary's.

""HM's establishment would become the only business in the State of Florida where performers have the freedom of speech and expression guaranteed by the First Amendment,"" lawyers for Hamburger Mary's wrote.

The Supreme Court on Thursday rejected Florida's bid to enforce statewide a contentious law that targets drag show performances that, challengers say, imposes unlawful restrictions on free speech.

The court, divided 6-3 with three conservatives dissenting, turned away an emergency request from Florida officials after lower courts blocked the law statewide. The majority did not explain its reasoning.

The measure, widely seen as part of a conservative campaign against LGBTQ rights, was passed this year by the Florida legislature. Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, who is seeking the Republican presidential nomination and has frequently leaned into to culture war issues, signed the bill into law. DeSantis this year also signed into law a bill that restricts transgender health care.

Officially dubbed the Protection of Children Act, the law makes it a crime to admit a child to an ""adult live performance"" that the state deems sexually explicit.

The three justices who would have granted the state's request were Justice Clarence Thomas, Justice Samuel Alito and Justice Neil Gorsuch.

A district court judge blocked the law under the Constitution's First Amendment in part because it was too vaguely written, with key terms such as ""lewd conduct"" not defined. The Atlanta-based 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals left that ruling in place.

The legal challenge was brought by an Orlando bar and restaurant called Hamburger Mary's, which hosts what it calls family friendly drag shows.

The restaurant's lawyers say in court papers that the shows ""are not harmful to minors but likely still run afoul of the act due to its overbreadth and vagueness.""

The district court prevented the state from enforcing the law not just against Hamburger Mary's but also statewide. The state argued that the judge did not have authority to do so.

In its application to the Supreme Court, the state asked the justices to narrow the injunction so it only applied to the restaurant.

Justice Brett Kavanaugh, another conservative, wrote a brief opinion explaining why he voted against the state, saying the narrow issue the state was raising was not one the court would normally hear. Fellow conservative Justice Amy Coney Barrett joined most of Kavanaugh's opinion.

""This case is therefore an imperfect vehicle for considering the general question of whether a district court may enjoin a government from enforcing a law against non-parties to the litigation,"" he wrote.","{'uri': 'nbcnews.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'NBC News'}",[],"https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_nbcnews-fp-1024-512,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2023-11/231102-drag-queens-florida-sj-241p-838bdc.jpg",eng-9068811,-0.03529411764705881,25,25,NBC News,nbcnews.com

About one mile into the vehicle pursuit, the suspect struck two Warren patrol cars. Dwyer says officers continued to pursue the suspect vehicle, which came across traffic congestion when trying to get on westbound I-94 near Woodward Avenue.

The suspect then struck the center median and intentionally hit the vehicles of people who were not involved in the incident.

An officer shot the suspect one time in the arm as they were trying to take the suspect into custody, according to Dwyer.

The suspect was taken to a local hospital with non-life-threatening injuries.

No one was injured, and there is no threat to the public.

The Prime Minister has announced that he will introduce emergency legislation to send those who come to our country illegally to Rwanda. I welcome his decision, as do I'm sure, the clear majority of the British public.

The immediate issue before us is whether the Government can send illegal migrants to a particular country in Africa.

The more fundamental question is where does ultimate authority in the United Kingdom sit? Is it with the British people and their elected representatives in Parliament? Or is it with the vague, shifting, and unaccountable concept of ""international law""?

There is no reason to criticise the judges. They have merely interpreted the law of the land. The fault lies with the politicians who have failed to introduce legislation that would guarantee delivery of our Rwanda partnership.

Now is not the time to waste energy on a post-mortem of how we got here. What matters for those of us who believe in effective immigration control is how to move forward. This requires honesty.

There must be an end to spin

Above all, it demands of the Government an end to self-deception and spin. There must be no more magical thinking. Tinkering with a failed plan will not stop the boats.

Amending our agreement with Rwanda and converting it into a treaty, even with explicit obligations on non-refoulement, will not solve the fundamental issue.

We lost in the Supreme Court because the judges determined that Rwanda cannot be trusted to fulfil the commitments we asked of them on non-refoulement, not because those promises were embodied in one type of legal instrument, a memorandum, rather than another, a treaty.

To try and deliver flights to Rwanda under any new treaty would still require going back through the courts, a process that would likely take at least another year.

That process could culminate in yet another defeat, on new grounds, or on similar grounds to Wednesday: principally, that judges can't be certain Rwanda will abide by the terms of any new treaty.

Even if we won in the domestic court, the saga would simply relocate to Strasbourg where the European court would take its time deciding if it liked our laws.

That is why the plan outlined by the PM will not yield flights to Rwanda before an election if Plan B is simply a tweaked version of the failed Plan A.

For emergency legislation to achieve what the PM says he wants, Parliament needs to amend the Illegal Migration Act so that it meets these five tests:

The Bill must address the Supreme Court's concerns regarding Rwanda

Parliament is entitled to assert that Rwanda is safe without making any changes to our Rwanda partnership.

However, for substantive and presentational reasons, it would be preferable to amend that agreement to address issues identified by the judges. This could include embedding UK observers and independent reviewers of asylum decisions.

It is less important whether these commitments are embodied in an amended memorandum or a new treaty.

What is crucial is that they are practical steps to improve Rwanda's asylum system. On the basis of these new commitments, Rwanda's safety could be credibly confirmed on the face of the Bill.The Bill must enable flights before the next general election

Legislation must therefore circumvent the lengthy process of further domestic litigation, to ensure that flights can take off as soon as the new Bill becomes law. To do this, the Bill must exclude all avenues of legal challenge. The entirety of the Human Rights Act and European Convention on Human Rights, and other relevant international obligations, or legislation, including the Refugee Convention, must be disapplied by way of clear ""notwithstanding"" clauses.

Judicial Review, all common law challenges, and all injunctive relief, including the suspensive challenges available under the Illegal Migration Act must be expressly excluded. Individuals would, however, be given the chance to demonstrate that they had entered the country legally, were under 18, or were medically unfit to fly - but Home Office decisions on these claims could not be challenged in court.Swift removal must mean swift removal

Those arriving illegally must be removed in a matter of days rather than months as under the Illegal Migration Act. This means amending the Act to ensure that removals to Rwanda are mandated under the duty to remove, with strict time limits. This will streamline the Home Office process as much as possible, so that the only Home Office decision is to determine whether an individual falls within the scheme or not.Those arriving here illegally must be detained

Legal challenges to detention must be excluded to avoid burdening the courts, making it clear that detention is mandated until removal.This must be treated as an emergency

The Bill should be introduced by Christmas recess and Parliament should be recalled to sit and debate it over the holiday period.

There is no longer any chance of stopping the boats within the current legal framework.

Having committed to emergency legislation, the Prime Minister must now give Parliamentarians a clear choice: to either properly control illegal migration, or explain to the British people why they are powerless under international law and must simply accept ever greater numbers of illegal arrivals on these shores.","{'uri': 'telegraph.co.uk', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'The Telegraph'}",[],https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/politics/2023/11/16/TELEMMGLPICT000356564825_17001667967510_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqrpfQw2hJyG_yckwxPAr0gmyy-GsNrhPQbLesooHneHs.jpeg?impolicy=logo-overlay,eng-9063836,-0.1294117647058823,25,25,The Telegraph,telegraph.co.uk

The plea was expected and a sentencing hearing began immediately following it in which Gould was given a $100,000 fine and two years of probation.

Glass, 22, was shot and killed in Colorado's high country after he called 911 for help when his car broke down. It happened on June 10 in Silver Plume and officers from several different law enforcement agencies responded. Glass told the emergency dispatcher he had two knives, a hammer and a rubber mallot. His family's attorney say that is because he was an amateur geologist. Over the span of an hour, officers told him he needed to get out of his car and dismissed attempts to drop the weapons out of his window. Glass refused to leave the car, saying he was scared. As things escalated, officers broke a window in an attempt to get him out and Glass grabbed one of the knives. Officers then tased him. Body cam video then showed Glass beginning to swing the knife wildly with his arm. That's when an officer or officers shot him.

As part of Gould's plea deal, he also agrees that he can't serve as a police officer or security officer ever again in the state of Colorado.

While Gould's case has wrapped up, another employee of the Clear Creek County Sheriff's Office, former deputy Andrew Buen, is fighting his charges of second-degree murder, official misconduct and reckless endangerment.

The trial judge had imposed the gag order last month and later fined Trump 15,000 dollars (£12,000) for violations after the former president made a disparaging social media post about a court clerk.

Judge David Friedman, of the state's intermediate appeals court, cited constitutional concerns about restricting Trump's free speech.

He issued a stay of the gag order, allowing Trump to comment freely about court staff while a longer appeals process plays out.

Trump's lawyers filed a lawsuit against the trial judge, Arthur Engoron, late on Wednesday, challenging the gag order as an abuse of power.

Judge Friedman scheduled an emergency hearing on Thursday around a conference table in a state appellate court a couple of miles from where the trial is unfolding.

Trump's lawyers had asked the appeals judge to scrap the gag order and fines imposed by the trial judge, Arthur Engoron, after the former president and his attorneys claimed that a law clerk was wielding improper influence.

Trump and his lawyers have repeatedly put the law clerk, Allison Greenfield, under a microscope during the trial.

They contend that the former Democratic judicial candidate is a partisan voice in Judge Arthur Engoron's ear - though he also is a Democrat - and that she is playing too big a role in the case involving the former Republican president.

Judge Engoron has defended her role in the courtroom, ordering participants in the trial not to comment on court staff and fining Trump for what the judge deemed violations.

Judge Engoron went on last week to prohibit lawyers in the case from commenting on ""confidential communications"" between him and his staff.

Trump's lawyers who, separately, sought a mistrial on Wednesday, say Judge Engoron's orders are unconstitutionally suppressing free speech, and not just any free speech.

""This constitutional protection is at its apogee where the speech in question is core political speech, made by the frontrunner for the 2024 Republican presidential nomination, regarding perceived partisanship and bias at a trial where he is subject to hundreds of millions of dollars in penalties and the threatened prohibition of his lawful business activities in the state,"" they wrote in a legal filing.","{'uri': 'dailymail.co.uk', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'Daily Mail Online'}",[],https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2023/11/16/20/wire-77899619-1700167151-530_636x382.jpg,eng-9065743,-0.2705882352941177,25,25,Daily Mail Online,dailymail.co.uk

Sky News understands the New Conservatives group - a cohort of predominantly red wall MPs on the right of the party - will demand the legislation be ""over-engineered"" so it can see off potential further legal challenges.

The Supreme Court ruled on Wednesday that the flagship immigration policy to deport refugees to Rwanda was unlawful.

Politics live: James Cleverly briefly forgets where he works and makes sly digs

The prime minister has rejected calls to scrap the plan, saying a new treaty with Rwanda would be signed and ""emergency legislation"" would be passed in order to declare the east African country safe and address the judges' concerns.

However, some Tory MPs are sceptical about the timings and fear the new bill could still be challenged.

The New Conservative group will make three requests to stop this from happening, including that the new legislation disapplies the UK Human Rights Act.

They will say it should also include ""notwithstanding"" clauses in order to override any international treaties or laws that could block the plan.

And they also want to give ministers powers to disregard so-called ""pyjama injunctions"" - which are last-minute orders from judges that could stop planes from taking off.

The group of MPs wants the legislation to be drawn up immediately, so it can be in place before the next general election.

The letter piles fresh pressure on Mr Sunak, who has staked his premiership on a promise to ""stop the boats"".

But with an election due by the end of next year, time is running out to pass new legislation, which can take months.

Earlier, Chancellor Jeremy Hunt said he could not guarantee flights will go to Rwanda next year - apparently contradicting Mr Sunak's position on Wednesday that the scheme will be up and running by spring, despite the Supreme Court ruling.

The UK's highest court said the scheme was not lawful because there was a risk that people sent to Rwanda could be deported to the countries they are fleeing from (a term known as refoulement).

The judges said this fell foul not only of the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR), which many Tory MPs want to leave, but also other international treaties and the UK's own domestic legislation.

Explainer - how did the government policy end up in the courts?

The yet-to-be-published treaty with Rwanda is expected to attempt to address the Supreme Court's concerns around refoulement.

However, it is not clear how the government thinks it can bypass human rights laws and international conventions, or when the new legislation will be brought before parliament.

Members of the House of Lords have warned the proposed emergency legislation bill is likely to face opposition and could very well be blocked by the upper chamber.

Former supreme court judge Jonathan Sumption told the BBC the plan to use a law to declare Rwanda as safe is ""constitutionally really quite extraordinary"" and would ""effectively overrule"" a decision by the UK's highest court.","{'uri': 'news.sky.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'Sky News'}",[],https://e3.365dm.com/23/11/1600x900/skynews-rishi-sunak-prime-minister_6362993.jpg?20231116204631,eng-9063836,-0.1137254901960785,25,25,Sky News,news.sky.com

It was then reported earlier today that a shooting took place outside of the El Paso Courthouse.

Someone was found dead on the floor with an apparent gunshot wound following the shooting, Colorado Springs Police spokesperson Ira Cronin confirmed. There are also unconfirmed reports of injuries at the scene. One suspect is currently in custody in relation to the shooting, CSPD said.

Colorado Springs Police Department announced on X saying: 'CSPD is responding to a shooting at the El Paso County Courthouse. PIO en route. Media staging will be at the corner of Tejon and Vermijo. Media should approach from the south' at 12:24 pm. They then posted an update at 12:36 pm saying: 'This is not an active shooter situation. There is no threat to the community. The courthouse will be closed for the remainder of the day. CSPD will provide more updates as appropriate.' In an update - CSPD posted: 'Once on scene, officers located one deceased individual with apparent gunshot wounds.

'This is being investigated as a homicide, however, the El Paso County Coroner's Office will determine the official cause and manner of death. 'At this time, this appears to be an isolated incident and not an active shooter incident. There is no threat to the community. There is one suspect currently in custody.' Many police and first responder vehicles were at the scene in Colorado after the shooting was reported earlier today. CSPD put up caution tape as well as screens to block the public's view.

Tejon Street between Colorado and Vermijo remains closed for police investigation. Video from outside the courthouse shows police officers as they escort an unidentified woman - who appeared to be distraught away from the scene as she sobbed in distress. Witnesses say the shooting was a domestic violence incident and confirmed that at least one person was shot. They say the courthouse was evacuated and a crime scene was set up. A female witness said she heard the shooting was a domestic disturbance between a husband and wife, according to CBS.

The Colorado Springs Fire Department said two people were treated on the scene for minor injuries. Whether those injuries came from gunshots or not is unclear at this time. A gentleman in court at the time of the alleged shooting said they were all sent to the third floor where they waited for 15 minutes, he told KOAA News 5. The man said it was scary - but he's glad his family is safe. This story is still developing as investigations continue.

A three-judge panel of the New York-based 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals heard arguments in Amazon's bid to toss out the ruling won last year by the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB), which stemmed from a union campaign at a Staten Island warehouse.

The NLRB had accused Amazon of firing a leading union organizer, Gerald Bryson, after a 2020 protest over an alleged lack of safety measures at the warehouse during the COVID-19 pandemic. The warehouse last year became the first in Amazon's history to unionize.

Amazon workers at two other New York warehouses and one in Alabama have since voted against unionizing. A union is currently seeking an election at a warehouse in California.

In Bryson's case, the NLRB had sought an injunction in court against Amazon pending the outcome of a related case playing out at the board.

U.S. District Judge Diane Gujarati in Brooklyn ordered Amazon to cease and desist from firing workers for engaging in union activity, while declining to require the company to reinstate Bryson.

On Thursday, 2nd Circuit Judges Richard Wesley and Denny Chin both expressed concerns that the order was not specific enough and merely required Amazon to comply with its existing obligations under federal labor law.

Wesley told NLRB lawyer Chad Wallace that the injunction seemed too sweeping given that Bryson was the only worker who was allegedly fired unlawfully.

""The problem I have is when you repeat this kind of generalized warning but it's in the context of a single incident,"" Wesley said.

Wallace said the order was sufficiently tailored because it dealt with a specific provision of the law - the ban on retaliating against workers for engaging in union activity.

""Terminating employees who actively and openly advocate for themselves is a hallmark violation"" of the National Labor Relations Act, Wallace said.

Circuit Judge Debra Ann Livingston seemed less sympathetic to Amazon, noting that Gujarati in a brief portion of her ruling stated that she had considered the ""equitable principles"" involved in issuing an injunction.

Amazon's lawyer, Stephanie Schuster, said the judge's order was not only overly broad, but was so vague that Amazon could not meaningfully comply with it and was at risk of being held in contempt of court.

""Amazon cannot tell from the four corners of the injunction precisely what conduct is prohibited,"" she said.

Amazon claims that it fired Bryson for making vulgar comments to a female employee during the April 2020 protest. A video of the protest showed Bryson calling the woman a ""crackhead"" and ""stupid,"" among other comments.

Some Republican lawmakers criticized the NLRB for pursuing the case, citing Bryson's conduct at the protest.

An NLRB administrative judge last year ordered Amazon to reinstate Bryson and the company appealed.

The five-member board in August remanded the case to the judge to apply a new legal standard the board had adopted for cases where employees engage in misconduct while exercising their rights to organize. The case is pending.

The case is Poor v. Amazon.com Services LLC, 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, No. 22-3182.

George Osborne has said that leaving the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) is ""off the table"" while Lord Cameron is Foreign Secretary.

Mr Osborne, who served as the former prime minister's chancellor, suggested that withdrawing from the international treaty would be too ""extreme"" for Lord Cameron, despite frustrations in Government after the Supreme Court ruled its Rwanda scheme unlawful.

It comes as Rishi Sunak was warned that his proposed new law to overcome the ruling would be blocked by the Lords, with a former Supreme Court judge describing it as ""constitutionally extraordinary"" and ""profoundly discreditable"".

Lord Cameron was brought back into Government by the Prime Minister earlier this week and made a life peer, following a seven-year break from front-line politics.

While prime minister, Lord Cameron appeared open to leaving the ECHR amid a row over whether a blanket ban on prisoners taking part in elections was in breach of their human rights.

However, Mr Osborne told his Political Currency podcast with Ed Balls: ""The interesting thing about David Cameron's appointment... I don't think necessarily he will go along with something as extreme as that. He's actually more Right-wing than I am on this. He was a Home Office special adviser for Michael Howard.

""He's always railed against elements of ECHR judgments. But I think the option of going into the general election saying we're going to pull out of the ECHR and throw the challenge to Labour, see whether they agree or not, I think that's basically now off the table because David Cameron is Foreign Secretary.""

When Lord Cameron was asked in 2015 whether the UK might pull out of the ECHR should it face obstacles in its attempt to change Labour-era human rights laws, he said he would ""rule out absolutely nothing in getting that done"".

""We are very clear about what we want, which is British judges making decisions in British courts,"" he added.

Following the Supreme Court's ruling on Wednesday, Mr Sunak insisted he would ""not allow a foreign court to block these flights"", but was not specific about what measures he would be willing to take.

Suella Braverman, the former home secretary, is among those on the Right wing of the Tory Party demanding that Mr Sunak introduces laws to specifically block off the ECHR, Human Rights Act and other routes of legal challenge to the Government's plan to deport asylum seekers to Rwanda.

The Government is expected to publish a new treaty with Rwanda next week, followed by emergency legislation a week later, to block legal challenges to the policy by declaring the country safe.

Ministers hope to fast-track the legislation and treaty through Parliament so that the first Rwanda flights can take off in spring.

However, James Cleverly, the Home Secretary, only committed on Thursday to saying he was ""absolutely determined"" to get them off by the next election.

The timetable will depend on securing Parliamentary approval for the emergency law underpinning the treaty, in which Rwanda has made legally binding commitments not to remove anyone deported from the UK.

This is designed to prevent any deported migrants from being sent to their home country where they could face persecution. This is the central reason why the Supreme Court ruled that the policy was unlawful and why it was judged unsafe as a destination for asylum seekers.

'Profoundly discreditable'

However, Lord Sumption, a Supreme Court judge from 2012 to 2018, said it was ""profoundly discreditable"" and ""constitutionally extraordinary"" for the Government to ""change the facts by law"" by proposing legislation that would declare Rwanda safe. He warned it would be unlikely to pass the House of Lords.

""It is not unusual for governments to promote legislation to change the law after an unfavourable judgment in the courts, but I have never heard of them trying to change the facts by law. For as long as black isn't white, the business of passing Acts of Parliament to say it is, is profoundly discreditable,"" he said.

""I would have thought there would be an enormous brouhaha. The Government has the advantage of quite a lot of public opinion supporting it, but that only carries you so far.

""It would be constitutionally a completely extraordinary thing to do, to effectively overrule a decision on the facts, on the evidence, by the highest court in the land.""

'Constitutional outrage'

Lord Carlile, a former independent reviewer of terrorism legislation for the Government, said legislating to declare Rwanda safe when the courts had found it not to be was a ""constitutional outrage"" and would face ""constructive obstruction"" in the Lords.

""It will get completely bogged down. It will go into eternal ping-pong. It is a no-hoper in the House of Lords, and deliberately sets up conflict between the two Houses,"" he said.

The Government would not be able to use the Parliament Act - a law that allows the Commons to overrule the Lords if a piece of legislation is voted down by peers - because it is the last Parliamentary session before the next election.

Lord Paddick, a former deputy assistant commissioner at the Metropolitan Police, said: ""Given the authority that retired judges have over the whole house, it would be unlikely for the House of Lords to effectively overrule the findings of fact of the Supreme Court.""

Sir Robert Buckland, a former Justice Secretary, said the Bill would ""struggle"" in the Lords because of the perception by peers that the legislation is ""inappropriate"" and even ""dangerous"".

'Absolutely priority'

Asked about the prospect of opposition in the Lords, Mr Cleverly said that peers should recognise that the Rwanda flights are ""an absolute priority"" of the British people.

""Their lordships are thoughtful people. I am sure they recognise that the British people particularly from poorer communities are the ones under most pressure from illegal migration,"" he said.

He noted that the courts had accepted that using a third country to handle asylum decisions was legal, and even the Supreme Court acknowledged that ""changes and capacity-building needed to eliminate that risk [of refoulement] may be delivered in the future"".

""We listened very carefully to the Appeal Court judgment and we've been working with the Rwandans since then,"" he told Times Radio.

""We've got a memorandum of understanding which we're going to upgrade to a treaty that can be done very, very quickly because we have been working on it for some time and the Prime Minister has committed to making sure that we get this emergency legislation into the House quickly.""","{'uri': 'telegraph.co.uk', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'The Telegraph'}","[{'uri': 'charles_hymas@telegraph.co.uk', 'name': 'Charles Hymas', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': False}]",https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/politics/2023/11/16/TELEMMGLPICT000346855032_17001629413090_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqgsaO8O78rhmZrDxTlQBjdLdu0TL-Cg_AMOUqySXmFgU.jpeg?impolicy=logo-overlay,eng-9063836,0.08235294117647052,25,25,The Telegraph,telegraph.co.uk

The judge in the Georgia election interference case has granted a request from Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis' office for an emergency protective order after parts of videos from key witnesses against former President Donald Trump and his allies were leaked to news outlets.Judge Scott McAfee on Thursday issued a protective order that prohibits attorneys in the case from sharing sensitive materials with the public. The order requires prosecutors to physically label evidence it seeks to protect as ""sensitive material"" and gives defense attorneys 14 days to contest any designations they disagree with. Willis' team now has 30 days to review all discovery they've already provided and label as sensitive.

McAfee said that the order would promote the flow of pre-trial discovery and, more importantly, protect the jury pool from evidence that may be deemed inadmissible at trial.

""The Court has an interest in ensuring that all parties retain their right to a fair trial before an unbiased jury, a process that could become unattainable should the public be allowed to vet every piece of unfiltered evidence months before trial,"" McAfee wrote in the filing.

Willis' office asked for the protective order in a court filing Tuesday after parts of the videotaped statements of Jenna Ellis, Sidney Powell and Kenneth Chesebro and bail bondsman Scott Hall were made public. In its filing, Willis' office argued that an order was necessary ""to protect witnesses and to safeguard sensitive and confidential information"" during the discovery process. It said the leaks were ""clearly intended to intimidate witnesses in this case, subjecting them to harassment and threats prior to trial.""

The DA in August charged 19 defendants with violating Georgia's Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organization act in connection with efforts to overturn the 2020 election results in the battleground state. Chesebro, Ellis, Hall and Powell have pleaded guilty. The videotaped statements, known as proffer videos, were made pursuant to the four defendants' plea agreements, which required them to give true and accurate information to prosecutors.

The Ellis and Powell statements were first reported by ABC News, while the Chesebro and Hall statements were first reported by The Washington Post. The recordings, which have not been independently obtained by NBC News, revealed new details of the defendants' testimony to prosecutors.

The videos showed Ellis recalling a conversation with Trump adviser Dan Scavino, who told her that Trump would not depart the White House regardless of the election results, she said. Powell had testified that Trump was repeatedly told by others that he'd lost the election to President Joe Biden.

A lawyer for Trump co-defendant Misty Hampton admitted at a hearing Wednesday that he had shared witness proffer videos of key figures in the case with a media outlet, saying he thought it was in his client's best interest.

Jonathan Miller, an attorney for Hampton, made the admission during an emergency hearing Wednesday for the protective order. Hampton is charged with a scheme to access voting machines in Coffee County, which Powell and Hall were also charged with.

""In being transparent with the court and to make sure that nobody else gets blamed for what happened and so that I can go to sleep well tonight, judge, I did release those videos to one outlet,"" Miller told McAfee during the hearing. ""In all candor to the court, I need the court to know that.""

McAfee had signaled Wednesday that he would issue a protective order barring the disclosure of certain discovery information by Thursday morning. He said the order would institute a process by which parties can label certain evidence as sensitive.

""Until we decide what's going to be relevant and admissible, this case should be tried and not in the court of public opinion,"" McAfee said during Wednesday's hearing.

Tom Clyde, an attorney for a coalition of media organizations that did not include NBC News, objected to the protective order, citing First Amendment interests, during the hearing Wednesday.

""Essentially what the state and the defendants are trying to do is get the authority of the court behind an order that will impose secrecy on information that is exchanged during the discovery process. Notwithstanding how newsworthy that information is, notwithstanding how much it might inform the public about the circumstances of this case, but particularly in this case, the circumstances of an election that took place, that's extremely significant in public importance,"" Clyde said.

McAfee said he disagreed with Clyde's arguments, but acknowledged the First Amendment concerns. The judge said a protective order was needed to protect the jury pool and to keep the flow of discovery going.

""Until we decide what's going to be relevant and admissible, this case should be tried and not in the court of public opinion,"" he said during the hearing Wednesday. ""We've already seen what may happen when a protective order is not in place.""

The next hearing in this case is scheduled for Dec. 1, when several motions from defendants will be argued.","{'uri': 'nbcnews.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'NBC News'}",[],"https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_nbcnews-fp-1024-512,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2023-11/231116-kenneth-chesebro-mn-1245-45a08e.jpg",eng-9061266,0.2862745098039217,25,25,NBC News,nbcnews.com

The trial judge had imposed the gag order last month and later fined Trump $15,000 for violations after the former president made a disparaging social media post about a court clerk.

In his decision, Judge David Friedman of the state´s intermediate appeals court cited constitutional concerns about restricting Trump´s free speech. He issued a stay of the gag order, allowing Trump to comment freely about court staff while a longer appeals process plays out.

Trump´s lawyers filed a lawsuit against the trial judge, Arthur Engoron, late Wednesday challenging the gag order as an abuse of power. Friedman scheduled an emergency hearing Thursday afternoon around a conference table in a state appellate courthouse a couple of miles from where the trial is unfolding.

Trump's lawyers had asked the appeals judge to scrap the gag order and fines imposed by the trial judge, Arthur Engoron, after the former president and his attorneys claimed that a law clerk was wielding improper influence.

Trump and his lawyers have repeatedly put the law clerk, Allison Greenfield, under a microscope during the trial. They contend that the former Democratic judicial candidate is a partisan voice in Judge Arthur Engoron's ear - though he also is a Democrat - and that she is playing too big a role in the case involving the former Republican president.

Engoron has responded by defending her role in the courtroom, ordering participants in the trial not to comment on court staffers and fining Trump a total of $15,000 for what the judge deemed violations. Engoron went on last week to prohibit attorneys in the case from commenting on ""confidential communications"" between him and his staff.

Trump's lawyers - who, separately, sought a mistrial Wednesday - contend that Engoron's orders are unconstitutionally suppressing free speech, and not just any free speech.

""This constitutional protection is at its apogee where the speech in question is core political speech, made by the frontrunner for the 2024 Republican presidential nomination, regarding perceived partisanship and bias at a trial where he is subject to hundreds of millions of dollars in penalties and the threatened prohibition of his lawful business activities in the state,"" they wrote in a legal filing.","{'uri': 'dailymail.co.uk', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'Daily Mail Online'}",[],https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2023/11/16/20/wire-77898885-1700165871-933_636x382.jpg,eng-9065743,-0.2627450980392156,25,25,Daily Mail Online,dailymail.co.uk

A Louisiana State Police spokesperson did not respond to questions about the investigation.

The investigation, which was first reported by local Louisiana media, originated with the Louisiana Department of Insurance, which found more than 20 insurance claim lawsuits were filed on behalf of people who said they had never hired MMA to represent them. Many of those people had never received the settlement funds from their cases, according to the complaint.

Representatives for MMA and the attorneys involved in the Louisiana cases, John Zachary Moseley and William Huye, did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Former name partner James McClenny directed questions to his attorney, who did not respond.

McClenny Moseley, which is based in Houston, filed hundreds of lawsuits in Louisiana state and federal courts last year against insurers on behalf of homeowners who suffered property damage from hurricanes Laura, Delta and Ida. In January, the firm attracted the scrutiny of judges over allegations that the attorneys improperly solicited or paid for clients through a marketing company and a roofer, brought claims against the wrong insurers, filed duplicate lawsuits or sued insurers that had already settled with their clients.

Attorneys from the firm have faced disciplinary proceedings in both state and federal court, court records show. A Louisiana federal judge has blocked the firm and its attorneys from collecting any fees in about 200 cases.

The law firm and its attorneys are also facing multiple malpractice lawsuits in state and federal court from former clients who say they lost out on their chance to pursue their insurer for compensation due to McClenny Moseley's mishandling of their case.

In May, the Louisiana Department of Insurance hit the firm with $2 million in fines, accusing the lawyers of engaging in fraud and unfair trade practices with about 850 homeowners.

The department, which was originally tipped off by insurance defense attorney Matthew Monson, took its findings to the Louisiana State Police in October, according to the complaint. A department representative did not respond to a request for comment about the investigation.

Monson told Reuters that ""there is a healthy basis"" for the investigation.","{'uri': 'reuters.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'Reuters'}","[{'uri': 'diana_novak_jones@reuters.com', 'name': 'Diana Novak Jones', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': False}]",https://www.reuters.com/resizer/j7lxWgrAPPiTQDFlQriQYxswjDc=/728x381/smart/filters:quality(80)/cloudfront-us-east-2.images.arcpublishing.com/reuters/UKAJJ6R7BFOIBJAC3MUHLGZILI.jpg,,-0.3254901960784313,25,25,Reuters,reuters.com

The judge overseeing former President Donald Trump's election interference case in Georgia has issued a protective order that certain ""sensitive"" evidence in the case be withheld from the public.

The order, issued Wednesday by Superior Court Judge Scott McAfee, came after the video recordings of interviews with some of Trump's co-defendants were leaked to the media earlier this week.

It specifies that prosecutors can deem certain evidence turned over to the defense as ""sensitive material"" unfit for public release, and provides that the defense can challenge such a designation within 14 days.

District Attorney Fani Willis had requested a broader version of the order following the leaking of the video interviews, citing potential harassment, witness intimidation, or jury pool tainting.

Defense attorney Jonathan Miller, who represents former Coffee County election supervisor Misty Hampton, admitted to leaking the video evidence, which included excerpts from prosecutor interviews with former Trump attorneys Jenna Ellis and Sidney Powell, as well as pro-Trump lawyer Kenneth Chesebro and Atlanta bail bondsman Scott Hall.

All four have pleaded guilty to charges in the case and agreed to cooperate with prosecutors as they pursue charges against the remaining 15 defendants.

The Maldives filed a separate declaration.

Under the court's rules, the declarations mean those countries will be able to make legal arguments in the case brought in 2019 following international outrage at the treatment of the Rohingya, a Muslim minority. Hundreds of thousands fled to neighboring Bangladesh amid a brutal crackdown by Myanmar forces.

Gambia argued that it and Myanmar are both parties to the 1948 convention outlawing genocide and that all signatories have a duty to ensure it is enforced. It asked the court to declare Myanmar in breach of the convention.

The court has already ruled it has jurisdiction, though hearings in the case have not been scheduled.

Myanmar's military launched what it called a clearance campaign in Rakhine state in 2017 in the aftermath of an attack by a Rohingya insurgent group. More than 700,000 Rohingya fled into neighboring Bangladesh. Myanmar security forces have been accused of mass rapes, killings and torching thousands of Rohingya homes.

Myanmar tried unsuccessfully to have the case thrown out, arguing the world court can only hear disputes between nations and Gambia was acting on behalf of the Organization of Islamic Cooperation.

The judges also dismissed Myanmar's claim that Gambia could not file the case as it was not directly linked to the events in Myanmar and that a legal dispute did not exist between the two countries before the case was filed.

The International Court of Justice rules on disputes between states. It is not linked to the International Criminal Court, also based in The Hague, which holds individuals accountable for atrocities.

An attorney for Phhhoto told the New York-based 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals that a lower trial court judge wrongly found the app's competition lawsuit against Meta was not filed in time.

Phhhoto accused Meta of manipulating an algorithm to suppress the app's animated photographs on the social media company's Instagram platform. U.S. District Judge Kiyo Matsumoto in Brooklyn dismissed the 2021 lawsuit in March because the allegations stemmed from 2016, outside the four-year window for antitrust plaintiffs to sue.

The case, which is one of several private and government lawsuits accusing Meta of anticompetitive practices, tests the legal principle of whether and when the statute of limitations can be extended.

Phhhoto launched in 2014 and said it had reached 10 million registered users two years later. It shut down in 2017.

Thursday's appeals court panel -- Chief Circuit Judge Debra Ann Livingston, sitting with Circuit Judges Denny Chin and Richard Wesley -- at points sounded skeptical of Phhhoto's contention that it could not have sued sooner.

""Don't you need to find something that occurred within the four years prior to the suit?"" Chin said at the hearing. Livingston pressed Phhhoto on ""warnings"" that might have given it ""some reason to worry that Meta was suppressing its content.""

Phhhoto's attorney, Scott Martin of the plaintiffs' firm Hausfeld, argued that Meta fraudulently ""concealed"" the change to its algorithm, making Phhhoto unable to immediately discern what was happening to the app and why.

""There was no evidence at all to lead them to believe that the algorithm was suppressing photo related content,"" Martin told the panel.

An attorney for Meta, Aaron Panner of Kellogg, Hansen, Todd, Figel & Frederick, countered that Phhhoto was ""on notice"" in 2016 about the impact of the algorithm change on the app's content.

""They can't explain why they waited five years to sue,"" Panner said.

Panner and Martin did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Meta has denied that it concealed anything from Phhhoto and urged the appeals court to uphold the dismissal of the lawsuit.

The case is Phhhoto Inc v. Meta Platforms Inc, 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, No. 23-0763.

For Phhhoto: Scott Martin of Hausfeld

For Meta: Aaron Panner of Kellogg, Hansen, Todd, Figel & Frederick

Kenya's high court on Thursday extended orders blocking the deployment of police officers to Haiti, even as parliament approved a government request to send 1,000 officers to the Caribbean nation to help deal with gang violence.

High Court Judge Chacha Mwita said he would issue a ruling on Jan. 26, effectively delaying the sending of security officers to Haiti, where they are slated to lead a multinational force backed by the U.N Security Council.

The planned deployment was first blocked by the High Court in Nairobi in October.

HAITIAN HOSPITAL SURROUNDED BY GANG MEMBERS; WOMEN, CHILDREN HELD HOSTAGE

Whatever decision is reached by the High Court in January may be appealed, meaning there could be a protracted battle over sending the troops to Haiti.

The court decision came hours after Kenya's parliament passed a motion allowing the deployment of the security officers.

But the government was immediately criticized for disobeying the court orders first issued in October that barred the deployment.

""The tabling of the motion in parliament today was belligerent. A disregard to the rule of law that clearly states that one arm of government cannot discuss a matter already seized by another arm,"" said former presidential candidate Ekuru Aukot, who filed the court case.

Herman Manyora, a professor of journalism at the University of Nairobi, said the government had no choice but to respect the court's decision on the delay.

""President William Ruto's government has a history of ignoring court decisions, but if it's a law-abiding government, it will wait until the court makes the final decision. Even the debate in parliament is a brazen defiance of the laws of the country.""

Earlier, the Kenyan parliament approved a government motion from the Committee on Administration and Internal Security approving the government's request to send the security officers as violence escalates in Haiti.

The heated debate saw opposition legislators reject government plans for Kenya to lead the multinational policing team in Haiti, saying it violated the country's constitution. Supporters of the motion said Kenya had a moral obligation and duty to aid Haiti.

The key issues in the debate were who would fund the deployment and what justifications there are for sending security forces to Haiti, thousands of miles from Kenya.

""Where is the sense in taking 1,000 police officers to Haiti when Kenyans are dying, in need of protection, in need of service from their police officers,"" argued opposition lawmaker Rozzah Buya.

Gabriel Tongoya, who chairs parliament's committee on administration and internal security, said all costs of the deployment would be funded by the United Nations.

Violence has escalated in Haiti as a heavily armed gang surrounded a hospital in the capital of Port-au-Prince on Wednesday, trapping patients who included 40 children and newborns. Police later rescued the patients.

Prime Minister Rishi Sunak has said he is aiming for the first removal flights to leave in the spring, after delivering reforms to the flagship policy, which has been ruled unlawful by the Supreme Court.

But Jeremy Hunt refused to commit to migrants who arrive via unauthorised means being sent to the east African country in 2024.

Speaking to broadcasters on Thursday, the Chancellor said: ""We are hopeful that because of the solutions that the Prime Minister announced yesterday we will be able to get flights off to Rwanda next year.

""We can't guarantee that.

""We have to pass legislation, emergency legislation, in the House of Commons (and) we have to sign a new international treaty with Rwanda.""

The Government is working to broker a new legally binding treaty on top of the £140 million deal already struck with Kigali after five top justices ruled against the policy on Wednesday.

Emergency legislation aimed at ensuring the Rwanda scheme can go ahead by deeming it a ""safe country"", despite the Supreme Court's concerns over risks to asylum seekers who are sent there, will be produced ""in the coming weeks"", Downing Street has said.

Mr Hunt said that, while the Supreme Court ruling was a ""setback"", ministers ""would not allow anything to get in the way of delivering the Prime Minister's pledge"" to put a stop to small boats of migrants crossing the Channel to Britain.

Mr Sunak has made ""stopping the boats"" one of his five pledges to the electorate ahead of the next election.

The threat of being deported to Rwanda has been regularly touted by the Conservative Party leader and other senior Government figures as one of the ways that can help deliver the commitment.

Pressed on whether deportation flights could take off before voters next go to the polls to elect a Westminster government, Mr Hunt said: ""We can't give a precise date as to when those flights will happen.

""But no-one should be in any doubt that we will do what it takes to secure our borders and stop the vile people-smuggling business and stop the small boats.""

The next election is expected to be held next year, with Mr Sunak needing to call a vote by January 2025.

Home Secretary James Cleverly, during broadcast interviews on Thursday, said he was ""absolutely determined"" to get a removal flight off the runway before the next election.

Mr Cleverly said MPs could ratify the new Rwanda treaty once it is agreed and pass new laws within days.

The yet-to-be-published treaty with Rwanda is expected to attempt to address the Supreme Court's concerns around refoulement - the potential for refugees whose applications for asylum are rejected by Kigali to be sent back to the country they are fleeing from.

Under pressure from sacked home secretary Suella Braverman and the right of the Conservative Party, Mr Sunak has kept the threat of pulling out of the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) on the table for the future in his battle to deport migrants.

But Mr Cleverly said he did not think withdrawing from the convention would be needed, saying instead that the focus should be on reform.

The Government is expected to face opposition to its plans in the House of Lords, where former Supreme Court judge Jonathan Sumption sits.

Lord Sumption told the BBC the plan to use a law to declare Rwanda as safe is ""constitutionally really quite extraordinary"" and would ""effectively overrule"" a decision by the UK's highest court.","{'uri': 'independent.co.uk', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'The Independent'}",[],https://static.independent.co.uk/2023/11/16/18/6125255e55f50816baabc01cc5d00609Y29udGVudHNlYXJjaGFwaSwxNzAwMjQ1NTQ3-2.74149104.jpg?quality=75&width=1200&auto=webp,eng-9063836,0.05098039215686279,25,25,The Independent,independent.co.uk

(AP) - Lawyers for Memphis Grizzlies guard Ja Morant are allowed to argue that he was acting in self-defense as part of a lawsuit accusing him of assaulting a teenager during a pickup basketball game at the NBA star's house, a judge ruled Thursday.

Circuit Court Judge Carol Chumney set a Dec. 11 hearing where lawyers for Morant and 18-year-old Joshua Holloway will discuss whether Morant is immune from liability under Tennessee law for hitting Holloway during a game at the All-Star player´s Memphis-area home in July 2022.

Morant´s lawyers have acknowledged he punched Holloway one time after Holloway threw a basketball at Morant and the ball hit Morant in the chin. In a July 26 motion, the player´s lawyers said he should be immune from liability under the state´s ""stand your ground"" law, which allows people who feel threatened at their homes to act with force in certain situations.

The law is used in criminal cases, but Chumney's ruling clears the way for Morant's lawyers to apply it in the civil case and attempt to have the lawsuit dismissed.

Morant´s accuser was 17 when the lawsuit was filed. It accuses Morant and friend Davonte Pack of assault, reckless endangerment, abuse or neglect, and infliction of emotional distress. An amended complaint identified the plaintiff as Holloway.

Morant filed a countersuit accusing Holloway of slander, battery and assault. No criminal charges have been filed against Morant. Pack has been charged with misdemeanor assault, and a hearing is set for Nov. 21 in state criminal court.

(AP Photo/Brandon Dill, File)

The lawsuit has led to complicated legal arguments, including disagreement about whether the state´s ""stand your ground"" law can be used to support Morant.

Holloway´s lawyer, Rebecca Adelman, has argued that the self-defense claim under the state law can´t be a reason to dismiss the civil case, partly because there is no ongoing criminal investigation against Morant. She has argued that Holloway has a right to a jury trial, which would not take place if the judge finds that Morant is immune.

Adelman has said the self-defense and immunity arguments came too late in the process. At a July hearing, she called it a ""Hail Mary of Hail Marys.""

Will Perry, Morant´s lawyer, has argued there are ways for the ""stand your ground"" law to apply in civil cases and that Morant is entitled to immunity. He has said the motion was timely because the trial is not scheduled until April 2024.

Lawyers for Morant and Holloway did not provide comment to reporters after the court hearing Thursday.

The NBA suspended Morant for the first 25 games this season after a video of him flashing a handgun was posted online. The video of Morant showing a gun while sitting in the passenger seat of a car was posted after he finished serving an eight-game suspension in March for a video in which he displayed a handgun in a Denver-area strip club.

The Jails and Justice Support Center (JJSC) has a mission of assisting jails ""in creating and sustaining safe, humane, and effective environments"" by working directly with jails to provide training and technical assistance, as well as providing referrals to other federal programs.

Associate Attorney General Vanita Gupta, the No. 3 official at the Justice Department, told NBC News in an interview that the department felt it was important to partner with law enforcement figures in the field and that the initiative is a reflection of what sheriffs and jail administrators said they need. Jails are ""at the frontlines"" of some of society's most difficult issues, Gupta said, adding that the smallest jails are often those in need of the most assistance.

The Justice Department has the ability to investigate individual jails when they find patterns and practices that violate constitutional rights. But the Jails and Justice Support Center is akin to preventative medicine, aimed at trying to proactively help jail administrators deal with issues on the front end, rather than investigating them on the back end.

The project is modeled after the Collaborative Reform Initiative -- a DOJ effort launched during the Obama administration in the wake of the unrest in cities like Ferguson, Missouri, after the 2014 death of Michael Brown and in Baltimore after the 2015 killing of Freddie Gray -- as well as the Law Enforcement Knowledge Lab, which DOJ launched last year.

Gupta, a progressive civil rights attorney who received support from major law enforcement organizations during her 2021 nomination, announced the launch of the hub at an event at the Arlington County Sheriff's Office in Virginia on Wednesday. Ahead of the launch, Gupta told NBC News that a comprehensive approach in collaboration with jail administrators would be the most effective and help deal with a variety of issues faced by law enforcement, including the recruitment and retention crisis that particularly impacts some of the lower-paying law enforcement jobs at jails.

Gupta said what they heard from the field was that jails needed ""real-time best practices and technical assistance."" Jail leaders and DOJ have the same goal, she said, ""which is safe facilities where the dignity, humanity, constitutional rights of everyone -- and that covers people who are incarcerated, the staff, people who are visiting jails -- are upheld and honored.""

It's similar to the work DOJ has done on policing, Gupta said.

""There will be a lot of learning from consent decrees, but also from sheriffs that are doing very innovative work around substance use disorders, use of Medicaid dollars to better help transition people who are leaving their facilities into community-based treatment, addressing the needs of people with behavioral and mental health disorders and practices that keep staff and incarcerated people safe,"" she said. ""Sheriffs are the first to tell you that they have been saddled with some of these really difficult social problems and that jails are at the frontlines of some of these difficult issues.""","{'uri': 'nbcnews.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'NBC News'}",[],"https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_nbcnews-fp-1024-512,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2023-11/231115-prison-cell-mjf-1751-257d19.jpg",,0.3333333333333333,25,25,NBC News,nbcnews.com

Italy's plan to send tens of thousands of migrants and refugees to Albania does not breach European Union law, officials in Brussels have ruled.

Albania is not an EU state and so its rules on asylum seekers do not apply to the Balkan nation, said the bloc's most senior official on migration.

Ylva Johansson, EU migration commissioner, said: ""The preliminary assessment by our legal service is that this is not violating EU law, it's outside EU law. EU law is not applicable outside EU territory.""

Ms Johansson's remarks imply that the scheme announced last week by Giorgia Meloni, the Italian prime minister, and Edi Rama, her Albanian counterpart, could not be challenged before the EU Court of Justice.

Under the accord, the Italians have been given permission to build two migrant centres in northern Albania.

Migrants transferred to holding facility

Migrants trying to cross the Mediterranean in boats from North Africa will be intercepted by the Italian navy or coastguard and brought to the port of Shengjin, a holiday resort where the Italians will build a reception centre.

They will then be transferred inland to a large holding facility built on an old Albanian air force base next to the village of Gjader.

About 3,000 a month will be processed. If their asylum applications are rejected, they will be repatriated to their home countries.

The Meloni government hopes the system will be able to handle about 36,000 migrants a year.

The bilateral accord has drawn comparisons with the British Government's plan to send asylum seekers to Rwanda, which was ruled to be unlawful by the Supreme Court on Wednesday.

The Italy-Albania plan has been criticised by human rights groups as well as opposition parties in both countries.

The two migrant facilities, which are due to open in the spring, will operate under Italian jurisdiction with Italian personnel.

So far this year, more than 147,000 migrants have arrived in Italy and the Meloni government is desperate to make good on electoral promises to stop the boats and get on top of the situation.

The Albania plan could act as a deterrent to prospective migrants, foiling their hopes of reaching the EU.

On Wednesday, Albania's government put forth a draft law on the five-year deal with Italy.

It will be debated and voted on in the 140-seat parliament, where Mr Rama's governing Socialists have 74 seats. It is not clear when the vote will be held.

As Italy struggles to handle the huge number of migrant arrivals, another 1,400 reached the tiny southern island of Lampedusa in 24 hours between Tuesday and Wednesday.

The migrant reception centre on the island is frequently overcrowded, with migrants sleeping on the ground and in scrubland outside its perimeter fence.","{'uri': 'telegraph.co.uk', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'The Telegraph'}","[{'uri': 'nick_squires@telegraph.co.uk', 'name': 'Nick Squires', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': False}]",https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/world-news/2023/11/16/TELEMMGLPICT000355759258_17001549738150_trans_NvBQzQNjv4Bq6BstALpMiKOXM0sIUAWNCNf11FLKtqwYaxK652uKeQE.jpeg?impolicy=logo-overlay,eng-9064144,0.0980392156862746,25,25,The Telegraph,telegraph.co.uk

But this isn't the end of the story - a version of the plan is likely to resurface in some form.

The initial reactions from the Prime Minister, Rishi Sunak, and his new Home Secretary, James Cleverly, shed light on where the Government plans to take this next.

After months of legal challenges, the UK Supreme Court ruled that the Rwanda plan was unlawful. The ruling was not about the concept of off-shoring the asylum process to another country. Rather, it found that Rwanda in particular is not currently a ""safe country"" in which to do this.

The court found that people sent to Rwanda would be at risk of ill-treatment and forcible return to the countries they had fled in search of protection.

In a statement in the Commons, Sunak made it clear that his Government was intent on ploughing on, and that his commitment to stopping small boat crossings was ""unwavering"". He also stressed that Rwanda was only part of the overall strategy on ""illegal migration"" that he intends to see implemented, and that the strategy is already working with irregular crossings declining.

Most telling is the emphasis Sunak placed on the court's ruling indicating that the principle of sending people to a safe third country is lawful. ""This confirms the Government's clear view from the outset,"" he said.

In other words: our thinking is right, all we need to do is either find another country that the courts will deem ""safe"", or make Rwanda ""safe"" by law to implement the plan. Both routes are already being pursued.

The search for alternative safe countries has been ongoing for months. This has involved official visits by ministers including Suella Braverman, and memorandums of understanding with countries like Turkey and Albania.

Sunak has also announced a new treaty with Rwanda as part of the plan, and emergency legislation to declare it a ""safe third country"" in law.

But this would still likely face legal challenges going up to the European Court of Human Rights, which interprets and upholds the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR).

In announcing the emergency legislation, Sunak said that he would ""not allow a foreign court to block these flights"" to Rwanda.

The political battle over the European court is an arguably fundamental part of this story. Since conception, the Rwanda plan was, for some, there to test the boundaries of the law and act as a Trojan horse for the Conservative right to push the UK outside the ECHR.

However, a key point from the supreme court ruling is worth emphasising here. While reading his summary of the judgment, Lord Reed noted that the ECHR is only one part of the relevant legal framework. So, even if the UK did leave, there are several UK and international laws that would still get in the way of removing people to Rwanda.

Another approach: exporting immigration detention

Up to now, the Government has framed the Rwanda plan as fulfilling a dual purpose: a deterrent - if people know they risk forced removal to Rwanda by crossing the Channel, they would not make the journey - and as a tool to manage the spiralling backlog of asylum claims.

But the response to the Supreme Court ruling may lead to a shift, moving the purpose away from managing the asylum processing system, and more towards managing migrants who breach immigration law. The latter route is backed up by the new Illegal Migration Act, which increases sanctions for irregular crossing and human smuggling.

This would mean separating the removal to Rwanda from the asylum process, and instead using it as a place to expand the UK's immigration detention capacity.

While likely to face legal challenges, there is already a template for this: the controversial plan announced in October to rent prison cells overseas ""to ensure dangerous offenders can be locked up for longer"".

Where does this leave the Rwanda plan, or any future iteration?

Arguably, the implementation of the plan was never the priority - and it could hardly be sold as a one-size-fits-all solution. While politically, the plan has been very effective in mobilising Conservative membership, logistically it is a different story.

Even if implemented, Rwanda would be able to host (at a high price) only a fraction of those the UK Government deems subject to removal.

Both Sunak and Cleverly have been at pains to highlight their plan has inspired similar approaches in Europe (namely Italy, Germany, Austria and Denmark). Despite this major legal blow, they still very much see themselves as leading the way in immigration solutions.","{'uri': 'express.co.uk', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'EXPRESS'}",[],https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/41/1200x712/5070322.jpg,eng-9063836,0.1372549019607843,25,25,EXPRESS,express.co.uk

While there have been individual cases linked to Syria’s civil war, there has been frustration in the West at the lack of a wider plan for international justice

The UN’s top court on Thursday ruled that Syria must stop its torture programme that investigators say killed tens of thousands, in the first international case over the brutal civil war that began in 2011.

The International Court of Justice said Syria must “take all measures within its power to prevent acts of torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment”.

The court also ruled that Syria must “prevent the destruction and ensure the preservation of any evidence” relating to torture.

Canada and the Netherlands had called on the ICJ to “urgently” order a halt to torture in Syrian jails, arguing that “every day counts” for those still in detention.

The ruling comes after France issued an international arrest warrant for Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, accused of complicity in crimes against humanity over chemical attacks in 2013.

In October, judges at the ICJ in The Hague heard searing testimony from Syrian detainees describing gang rape, mutilation and punishment involving contorting people into a car tyre and beating them.

The court was asked to issue “provisional measures” to stop torture and arbitrary detention in Syria, open prisons to outside inspectors and provide information to families about the fate of their loved ones.

Torture in Syria is “pervasive and entrenched … and continues today”, Canada and the Netherlands wrote in their submission to the ICJ.Syrian first lady thanks China for support, halting plans ‘still being hatched’

Victims endure “unimaginable physical and mental pain and suffering as a result of acts of torture, including abhorrent treatment in detention … and sexual and gender-based violence”, the submission added.

“Tens of thousands have died, or are presumed dead, as a result of torture,” the two countries added, citing a report from the UN Human Rights Council.

Damascus snubbed the October hearing but has previously dismissed the case as “disinformation and lies” and said the allegations “lack the slightest degree of credibility”.

“It is our sincere belief that the lives and well-being of Syrians are at stake and require the court’s immediate attention,” said Rene Lefeber, top representative for the Netherlands, at the hearing on October 10.

While there have been individual war crimes cases linked to the Syrian war in some countries, there has long been frustration in Western capitals at the lack of any wider plan for international justice.

The Dutch first launched a bid in September 2020 to hold Syria responsible for alleged breaches of the United Nations Convention against Torture, to which Damascus is a signatory. Canada joined the case the following March.

The International Criminal Court (ICC) – a war crimes court which, like the ICJ, is based in The Hague – has been unable to deal with Syria because Damascus never ratified the Rome Statute, the tribunal’s founding treaty.

The situation has gained renewed attention after the return of Assad to the international fold in May, when he attended an Arab League summit.","{'uri': 'scmp.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'South China Morning Post'}",[],https://cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/d8/video/thumbnail/2021/03/10/thumbnail_webyt_clean.jpg?itok=nIqnZi_g,eng-9067706,-0.8352941176470589,25,25,South China Morning Post,scmp.com

A misconduct investigation was launched after it was decided the case did not meet the requirements for a criminal prosecution.

A Metropolitan Police officer has been dismissed for gross misconduct after sexual activity with an underage runaway child who was reported missing.

The officer - granted anonymity and named only as Officer A - ""exploited and abused"" the child after making contact with them on social media and arranging to meet them on 16 August 2019, a misconduct hearing was told.

They engaged in sexual activity with the child on several occasions between 16-27 August and allowed them to stay on 26 August without informing police or social services.

The following day, 27 August, Officer A asked the child to attend Romford Police Station in east London as a ""missing person"" - but ask for them, but keep their relationship secret.

Officer A failed to make a formal police record that the missing child had been found, the hearing was told.

It was only then that the child was taken by Officer A to social services.

An allegation of serious sexual assault was made against Officer A in September 2019, with a full criminal investigation then launched before the officer was suspended from duty and later arrested.

However, the Crown Prosecution Service, after reviewing the evidence, decided the case did not meet the requirements for a criminal prosecution.

The decision was challenged by the Victim's Right of Review process but was dismissed.

But officers from the Metropolitan Police's directorate of professional standards continued a misconduct investigation and decided there was a case to answer, ahead of a full misconduct hearing.

A misconduct panel found Officer A had breached police standards of professional behaviour regarding discreditable conduct, duties and responsibilities, and honesty and integrity.

The panel, led by an independent, legally qualified chair, determined the officer should be sacked without notice.

The cases in April were consolidated in Nashville as part of multidistrict litigation. The defendants have denied wrongdoing, and RealPage has called the alleged conspiracy ""implausible.""

The class-action lawsuits on behalf of students and other renters claim landlords have shared non-public information -- including vacancy data -- with RealPage and relied on its algorithms to keep rental prices inflated above competitive levels.

The government's filing called algorithms ""the new frontier"" of price-fixing, and argued that the use of shared data and software must ""be subject to the same condemnation"" as other price-fixing schemes.

""Longstanding legal principles apply with equal force to this new machinery,"" the Justice Department said.

A spokesperson for Texas-based RealPage on Thursday did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The defense motions to dismiss are pending before Chief U.S. District Judge Waverly Crenshaw Jr.

RealPage is owned by Chicago-based private equity firm Thoma Bravo, which has called the plaintiffs' claims ""threadbare."" Thoma Bravo did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

The Justice Department declined to comment.

Lawsuits against RealPage and large property management companies began piling up last year. The plaintiffs said they have evidence from confidential witnesses to help buttress their claims of a price-fixing conspiracy.

The District of Columbia on Nov. 1 became the first governmental entity to sue RealPage over its pricing software. The District, working with a private law firm, alleged residents had paid ""millions of dollars above fair market prices.""

The case is In re: RealPage Rental Software Antitrust Litigation, U.S. District Court, Middle District of Tennessee, No. 23-md-03071.

With investors' earnings at risk, the Supreme Court will soon decide -- in the case SEC v. Jarkesy -- whether to disable the Securities and Exchange Commission's administrative enforcement proceedings, one of the major enforcement mechanisms targeting securities fraud in the United States.

First, some background on the action before the Supreme Court: In 2011, the SEC began investigating George Jarkesy, a founder of two hedge funds, and his investment adviser, Patriot28, for misrepresenting the funds' investment strategies. Two years later, the SEC brought an administrative proceeding against Jarkesy before an administrative law judge (ALJ), who found that Jarkesy and Patriot28 had violated the Securities Act, the Exchange Act, and the Advisers Act. The SEC issued its own decision with the same findings and imposed a cease-and-desist order and a $300,000 penalty on Jarkesy and Patriot28.

Jarkesy challenged not only the findings but the process for reaching them. This process was expanded in the 2010 Dodd-Frank Act, which increased the SEC's ability to seek penalties through SEC administrative proceedings, broadening their reach to include publicly-traded companies and their personnel. The expansion appeared to have an immediate effect, with the percentage of actions brought through administrative proceedings tripling in the years right after Dodd-Frank Act's passage -- from 21% in 2010 to 76% in 2015.

A 2020 study by Xin Zheng, a Professor at the University of British Columbia, found that these SEC administrative proceedings resolve cases in, on average, just 10 days -- nearly 27 times faster than SEC actions brought in federal court -- and result in settlement 99% of the time. Zheng's study further found that the SEC was able to bring more enforcement actions generally post-Dodd Frank due to the agency's expanded ability to bring actions through administrative proceedings. Xin Zheng, ""A Tale of Two Enforcement Venues: Determinants and Consequences of the SEC's Choice of Enforcement Venue After the Dodd-Frank Act"" (The Accounting Review, conditionally accepted).

In his appeal to the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, Jarkesy argued that SEC administrative proceedings are unconstitutional. The 5th Circuit ruled in Jarkesy's favor, holding that (1) Jarkesy was entitled to a jury trial under the Seventh Amendment of the Constitution; (2) Congress had unconstitutionally delegated lawmaking power to the SEC by allowing it to seek civil penalties through administrative proceedings; and (3) the SEC's appointment of ALJs with lifetime tenure violated Article II of the Constitution.

The SEC appealed the 5th Circuit's decision to the Supreme Court, arguing that (1) Congress did not violate the Seventh Amendment by authorizing the SEC to seek civil penalties through administrative proceedings because the securities claims involve ""public rights"" which, under Article III, may be adjudicated outside a federal court; (2) the ""non-delegation"" doctrine did not bar the SEC from bringing administrative proceedings because those proceedings are a form of executive discretion, not a form of lawmaking authority; and (3) Article II does not bar ALJs from receiving tenure protection because ALJs are ""inferior officers"" and thus Congress may restrict their removal.

The Supreme Court took the case and is scheduled to hear oral argument on Nov. 29, 2023. Over 35 amici have filed briefs weighing in on these issues. Groups of administrative law scholars and the American Bar Association filed briefs in support of the SEC; meanwhile, attorneys general from 18 states, along with high-profile individuals like Mark Cuban and Elon Musk, filed briefs in support of Jarkesy. The Supreme Court is expected to issue a decision sometime next year.

As oral argument before the Supreme Court approaches, focus among legal scholars will likely -- and understandably -- be on the contours of the ""non-delegation"" doctrine, which has wide-ranging implications on the ability of federal agencies, including the SEC, to exercise their authority. However, those most focused on uprooting corporate fraud understand that Jarkesy could also mark a new era of securities enforcement.

Under the current legal landscape, SEC enforcement actions constitute one of two major mechanisms that investors rely on for the deterrence and punishment of securities fraud -- the other is private securities actions brought by the injured shareholders themselves. While both sets of actions target the same behavior, they operate in different ways. For example, the SEC has broad subpoena power to support its investigations, enabling it to gather information quickly and without the delays of civil discovery. In contrast, private securities class actions are brought in court by the injured investors and proceed through the regular course of discovery and litigation.

Currently, these actions often work in complement to one another. Complaints filed by shareholders and their attorneys may prompt the SEC to launch its own investigations and proceedings. Similarly, the fruits of an SEC investigation may sometimes help plaintiff shareholders meet their pleading burden to survive a motion to dismiss and ultimately establish intent, a requirement in proving securities fraud.

To be sure, a decision by the Supreme Court against the SEC would likely alter this landscape, but it would not leave investors wholly unprotected. First, the Supreme Court will only decide the fate of the SEC's administrative enforcement proceedings -- meaning that no matter which way the Court rules, the SEC will still have authority to bring enforcement actions in federal court.

While the SEC has increasingly made administrative proceedings an equal -- and, in some years, preferred -- forum for enforcement actions, an adverse decision in Jarkesy should not keep the Commission from investigating and penalizing securities fraud.

Second, even without the benefit of concurrent SEC investigations, securities class actions provide, as the Supreme Court has repeatedly noted, ""a most effective weapon in the enforcement of the securities laws."" See Stoneridge Investment Partners, LLC v. Scientific-Atlanta, Inc. 552 U.S. 148 (2008); Bateman-Eichler, Hill Richards, Inc. v. Berner, 472 U.S. 299 (1985).

SEC v. Jarkesy comes before the Supreme Court at a time when corporate fraud and its impacts on investors are attracting much-deserved attention. A study this year from the University of Chicago Booth School of Business estimates that on average 10 percent of public companies commit securities fraud and that only one-third of corporate fraud is detected. ""How pervasive is corporate fraud?"" A study from the University of Chicago Booth School of Business, A. Dyck, A. Morse, L. Zingales, Review of Accounting Studies, January 2023.

As investors and their attorneys seek to become ever more vigilant about holding corporations accountable, the Jarkesy case will be one to watch.","{'uri': 'reuters.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'Reuters'}",[],https://www.reuters.com/resizer/VXYOqbsXwdxSEZtqlLztPzsB_F0=/800x419/smart/filters:quality(80)/cloudfront-us-east-2.images.arcpublishing.com/reuters/JWEQ6JL6BBJG5KXXB63H4NHGEE.jpg,,0.02745098039215677,25,25,Reuters,reuters.com

Graham Phillips, who is living in Ukraine, was made the subject of an ""asset freeze"" in July 2022 - a decision upheld on ""ministerial review"" in February, a judge has been told.

Lawyers representing Mr Phillips have taken legal action against Foreign Secretary David Cameron - and say the decision was ""Orwellian"" and should be quashed.

Mr Justice Swift, who heard that Mr Phillips had expressed ""political opinions"" on YouTube and social media to a ""primarily UK domestic audience"", finished overseeing a High Court hearing, in the Royal Court of Justice complex, on Thursday.

He said he aimed to deliver a ruling in the near future.

The judge was told that Liz Truss had been Foreign Secretary when the decision was taken and James Cleverly was Foreign Secretary when it was upheld on review.

Ministers are fighting Mr Phillips' bid to lift sanctions.

Lawyers representing Mr Cameron argued that decisions taken were correct and said Mr Phillips' claim should be dismissed.

Mr Phillips was the ""first mono-British"" national to be ""subjected to sanctions by the British Government"", a barrister leading his legal team told the judge.

This serious interference with the rights of a British citizen, brought about by an act of executive fiat purely for expressing their views, is Orwellian irrespective of the offensiveness of the views concerned Joshua Hitchens

Joshua Hitchens said ministers had not accused Mr Phillipa of any crime, of being part of ""Russian State apparatus"", of ""advancing the Russian war effort"" in Ukraine, or of supporting the Russian economy.

He said Mr Phillips' designation stemmed ""entirely"" from ""political opinions expressed on YouTube and social media to a primarily UK domestic audience"".

Mr Hitchens argued that Mr Phillips' ""designation"" was ""disproportionate"" and ""Orwellian"".

""The power the (Foreign Secretary) claims to possess is expansive and unprecedented in modern British political and legal history,"" he said in a written case outline.

""The defendant's position is that he has the power to designate British citizens lawfully exercising their right to freedom of expression on matters of political controversy.

""The effect of such designation is to deprive the subject of access to their possessions, their ability to earn a living and their capacity to meet even their most basic needs.

""A British national subject to an asset freeze is effectively excommunicated from the economy.

""This serious interference with the rights of a British Citizen, brought about by an act of executive fiat purely for expressing their views, is Orwellian

irrespective of the offensiveness of the views concerned.""

Mr Phillips, who watched the hearing from Ukraine via video link, was mentioned in a debate in the Lords in June 2022.

Labour former defence secretary Lord Browne of Ladyton was asked whether the Government had launched an investigation into Mr Phillips.

He described Mr Phillips as a ""British former civil servant and pro-Russian propagandist"".","{'uri': 'dailymail.co.uk', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'Daily Mail Online'}",[],https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2023/11/16/17/wire-77891069-1700154531-749_636x382.jpg,eng-9068030,0.1607843137254903,25,25,Daily Mail Online,dailymail.co.uk

The ruling came after news outlets this week reported on the contents of and published clips from interviews that four defendants conducted with prosecutors as part of their plea deals.

Fulton County Superior Court Judge Scott McAfee wrote that allowing parties the ""unfettered ability"" to publicly share pretrial materials undermines the discovery process, during which lawyers for both sides share evidence. ""Potential jurors should be limited from exposure to materials that may be deemed inadmissible at trial,"" McAfee wrote.

""The likelihood of harm in this case is severe, as extensive media coverage guarantees broad dissemination of any disclosed discovery materials,"" McAfee wrote.

Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis had initially asked for an order prohibiting the disclosure of any of the evidence shared with the defense. But prosecutors told the judge during a remote hearing Wednesday they agreed with a more narrowly focused order proposed by one of the defendants.

A lawyer for a coalition of news outlets, including The Associated Press, argued during the hearing against any protective order, saying such a step requires the showing of a substantial threat of physical or economic harm to a witness - and that this burden had not been met.

Trump and 18 other people were charged in August with participating in a wide-ranging scheme to illegally try to keep the then-Republican president in power after his 2020 loss to Democrat Joe Biden. Four people have pleaded guilty after reaching deals with prosecutors. The remaining 15 have pleaded not guilty. No trial date has been set.

McAfee's order instructs prosecutors to review their discovery and designate as ""sensitive materials"" anything they believe should not be disclosed. Defendants will have 14 days after receiving the discovery to contest that designation. If the two sides cannot agree on whether it is appropriate, the judge will decide. The evidence would not be disclosed until he has ruled.

The protective order does not apply to information or records that are publicly available, that the defendants obtain in another way or that has been field or received as evidence in another court proceeding.

Defense attorney Jonathan Miller, who represents former Coffee County elections director Misty Hampton, told the judge he had released the videos of the interviews to one media outlet, but did not identify it. The Washington Post and ABC News reported on the videos Monday.

The interviews, called proffers, gave a glimpse into what kind of testimony might be offered at trial by the four people who pleaded guilty: lawyers Sidney Powell, Kenneth Chesebro and Jenna Ellis, and bail bondsman and Trump supporter Scott Hall.

Miller said he believes that the interviews with two of those people - Powell and Hall - could be helpful to his client and argued that the public had the right to see what they said.

The date for the verdict was announced at the end of Justice Minister Eric Dupond-Moretti´s two-week trial. He has refused to resign but could do so if found guilty on conflict of interest charges.

The minister consistently denied wrongdoing during the trial and called the case against him ""illegitimate.""

""I had no desire to settle scores with anyone,"" he said.

Prosecutor Rémy Heitz accused the minister of abuse of power and asked the court to impose a 1-year suspended prison sentence.

Once a high-profile lawyer, Dupond-Moretti is accused of abusing his position to order probes targeting magistrates who investigated him, his friends and his former clients. He faces up to five years in prison and a half-million euros ($537,000) in fines if convicted on charges of illegal conflict of interest.

The trial marked the first time in modern France that a government minister was put on trial while still in office, according to legal historians.

He was tried in a special court for alleged wrongdoing by the government, the Court of Justice of the Republic. He faced three professional magistrates accompanied by 12 members of parliament - six from the lower house and six from the Senate - who will issue the ruling.

A majority of eight votes is required to decide on guilt and sentence.

The chief judge of the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, Priscilla Richman, in an order on Wednesday said further action was ""unnecessary"" after Jones last month submitted his resignation as a Southern District of Texas bankruptcy judge.

Jones announced plans to resign on Oct. 15 after acknowledging to the Wall Street Journal that he had been in a years-long romantic relationship with bankruptcy attorney Elizabeth Freeman and shared a home with her.

Freeman until recently worked at Jackson Walker, a local law firm that worked on many corporate bankruptcy cases in Jones' Houston courthouse.

Jones' resignation came shortly after the 5th Circuit had launched an ethics inquiry and Richman's filing on Oct. 13 of a misconduct complaint that found there was probable cause to believe Jones violated the codes of conduct that govern judges.

Richman's complaint said Jones never recused himself from cases involving Jackson Walker or disclosed his relationship with Freeman. He also approved attorneys' fees sought by the firm for work on matters in which billing records showed Freeman performed ""substantial"" services, Richman said.

Jones and Freeman's lawyer did not respond to requests for comment. Vikram Chandhok, the 5th Circuit's chief mediator, declined to elaborate beyond Wednesday's order.

Wednesday's order ending the investigation came the same day Jones' resignation became effective. Only sitting judges, and not former ones, can be subject to remedial action under the Judicial Conduct and Disability Act of 1980 and related rules.

Those regulations, though, would have permitted the 5th Circuit Judicial Council to still assess ""potential institutional issues"" related to the complaint even if Jones could no longer himself be disciplined.

The 10th Circuit Judicial Council, for example, relied on that authority last year as part of a probe into a then-New Mexico magistrate judge's workplace environment to still examine institutional issues even after her term on the bench expired.

The U.S. Department of Justice's bankruptcy watchdog, the Office of the U.S. Trustee, is seeking to force Jackson Walker to return fees it earned in cases Jones presided over. It said the firm earned about $13 million in at least 26 such cases, including J.C. Penney's and Neiman Marcus' bankruptcies.

The 500-lawyer law firm in filings on Monday said that after learning of the allegations in 2021 from a disgruntled litigant, it confronted Freeman, who said she had ended her relationship with Jones the prior year. The firm said it sent the allegations to the Houston bankruptcy court under seal.

Malaysian police said on Monday they arrested seven Japanese men suspected of operating a phone scam that targeted citizens in their home country after raiding a condominium in Kuala Lumpur.

The men, aged between 23 and 41, were arrested and immediately charged with violating immigration law.

The police said they raided a flat in the Malaysian capital and apprehended the suspects, seizing their phones and other items, after being tipped off by the Japanese Embassy.

Investigations showed that “the syndicate was operating a phone scam” targeting Japanese nationals using the Skype call and messaging application to contact their victims, Commercial Crime Investigation Department head Ramli Mohamed Yoosuf said.Chinese man accused of stealing passwords linked to e-cigarette scam, Japan says

The syndicate members allegedly impersonated banking staff and told victims there were problems with their accounts, requesting that they transfer funds to another account provided by the scammers.

The suspects are being held by immigration authorities pending further investigation.

Crime syndicates involving Japanese nationals have been reported in other parts of Southeast Asia recently.

Earlier this month, Japanese police arrested 25 Japanese men suspected of running a phone scam out of Phnom Penh after they were deported from Cambodia.

In Thailand, police also apprehended two Japanese citizens this month for conducting similar scams from Bangkok.Trapped scam victims in Myanmar pin hopes on China’s cybercrime crackdown

It has also become a problem domestically in Japan, where local authorities are considering restricting retirees’ ability to access cash machines in an effort to halt the worsening problem of scammers fooling elderly people into parting with large amounts of money.

Concerned at the growing number of phone scams, Japan’s National Police Agency has proposed that the banking industry introduce new safeguards. Under the proposal, anyone who is over the age of 65 and has not used their bank card to access their account for more than a year would have it suspended.

While the scope of the proposal is relatively limited, some older Japanese have raised concerns that it may prevent them from accessing their bank accounts, and fear additional restrictions could be imposed if it does not prove effective in halting the scams.","{'uri': 'scmp.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'South China Morning Post'}",[],https://cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/d8/images/canvas/2023/11/20/33321953-7615-4a2b-819b-3a5d79a992e6_cdab6bdc.jpg?itok=fVZHfbz3,eng-9076460,-0.6549019607843137,79,79,South China Morning Post,scmp.com

Two years into Texas pushing the boundaries of immigration enforcement - busing migrants out of state, stringing razor wire along the border and installing water barriers in the Rio Grande - new plans to let police arrest migrants and order them to leave the country is setting up another test that would likely face a court challenge.

Opponents say handing all Texas law enforcement such power would risk inadvertent arrests of U.S. citizens, put families of mixed immigration status in danger during routine outings and make crime victims fearful of going to the police for help.

As anger among Democrats mounted Wednesday night, one lawmaker recorded and then posted video of a colleague lashing into Republicans during a private huddle on the floor of the Texas House.

""Y'all don't understand the (expletive) you do hurts our community,"" state Rep. Armando Walle is seen saying in the video. ""It hurts us personally.""

Texas has arrested thousands of migrants along the U.S.-Mexico border on criminal trespassing charges since 2021. But the new law would dramatically expand arrest powers to all Texas police and allow to them to take migrants to ports of entry along the border and order them into Mexico. If they don't leave the U.S., the law would allow police to arrest them.

The power to regulate immigration lies primarily with the U.S. government. and opponents say Texas' latest efforts flies in the face of U.S. law.

Critics have compared the proposal to a 2010 Arizona law that required police, while enforcing other laws, to question the immigration status of people suspected of being in the country illegally. The U.S. Supreme Court struck down key provisions of that law two years later.","{'uri': 'dailymail.co.uk', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'Daily Mail Online'}",[],https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2023/10/26/18/wire-77043669-1698340104-3_636x382.jpg,eng-9007299,-0.1686274509803921,57,57,Daily Mail Online,dailymail.co.uk

The bill, approved by a vote of 97 to 3, would make life difficult for illegal immigrants who manage to enter the country by cracking down on the fraudulent documents that allow many to work and by sharply curbing the distribution of federal benefits--from welfare to student financial aid. The legislation would nearly double the number of Border Patrol agents, equip them better and put up miles of fencing and other barriers.

Smugglers would face far tougher penalties under the legislation, as would those who engage in the multimillion-dollar business of manufacturing fake identification papers. The bill also would build additional detention facilities for those caught in the country illegally and would streamline deportation procedures.

Struck from the bill before its passage were most of the provisions affecting legal immigrants, including cuts in the number of those allowed to enter the country. But the bill would sharply limit federal benefits for noncitizens and would hold legal immigrants' sponsors financially responsible for those they bring into the country.

""We have brought forth significant changes in legal and illegal immigration that are rather sweeping,"" said Sen. Alan K. Simpson (R-Wyo.), the chief sponsor of the bill. ""This issue is about America, and America is about conflict and resolution. It's about these things that pull and tear at us.""

It was California's Proposition 187, the 1994 initiative seeking to bar illegal immigrants from a variety of public services, that catapulted immigration onto the national stage. Six weeks ago, the House passed a similar crackdown.

President Clinton is expected to sign the bill, but the White House is pressing for changes when a conference committee meets to reconcile the two versions of the legislation.

""While this bill strongly supports our enforcement efforts, it still goes too far in denying legal immigrants access to vital safety net programs, which could jeopardize public health and safety,"" Clinton said in a statement.

The Senate bill differs from the House version in one significant respect: It lacks a provision sponsored by Rep. Elton Gallegly (R-Simi Valley) that would give states the right to ban public schooling for illegal-immigrant children.

Senate Majority Leader Bob Dole (R-Kan.) endorsed the concept while campaigning in California, but he and other Republican leaders opted to leave the controversial bill out of the Senate measure.

The White House has said that including the schooling ban in the final legislation would trigger a veto.

Gov. Pete Wilson said he welcomed the Senate's action but that ""no illegal-immigration reform will be complete in addressing the concerns of Californians unless it includes the Gallegly amendment, which would allow states to set their own public education policies toward illegal immigrants.""

Advocate groups differed on what effect the new law would have, with the bill pleasing neither immigrant-rights groups nor hard-line immigration reformers.

Christa M. Schacht, staff attorney with the Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund, said she fears that the legislation could bring on ""far-reaching and unintended consequences"" and an ""atmosphere of intolerance"" affecting Latinos in general.

But K.C. McAlphin, deputy director of the Federation for American Immigration Reform, said the Senate pulled its punches because of cries from special interests.

""This is not going to make a dent in solving the problem,"" he said. ""It's a charade. It's not real. Once they get here, illegal immigrants are still home free.""

Opposing the bill were three Democrats: Russell D. Feingold of Wisconsin, Paul Simon of Illinois and Bob Graham of Florida.

The legislation would mandate the hiring of 1,000 new Border Patrol agents over each of the next four fiscal years, dramatically increasing the current 5,100-person force. It would also equip them with state-of-the-art technology.

The bill also would provide for construction of triple-fencing along parts of a 14-mile stretch of the California-Mexico border.

In the workplace, the bill would set up a series of pilot programs under which employers could tap into a government database to verify the immigration status of new hires. This initiative is vehemently opposed by some critics who see it as a dangerous step toward a Big Brother-style society.

The system is designed to counter the proliferation of counterfeit work-authorization documents.

To help employers, the bill would reduce the number of allowable work-authorization documents from three dozen to six.

In Orange County, federal agents have already made some high-profile efforts to stamp out the thriving street market for bogus documents. Santa Ana is a hub for the production and sale of fake immigration cards, Social Security cards, drivers licenses and other documents, authorities say.

Late last year, the INS doubled the number of agents working in Orange County to about two dozen. In February, INS agents and Santa Ana police arrested seven people and deported eight others, after seizing printing equipment and stacks of false documents in a raid. Agents say documents printed in Santa Ana have been tracked to cities across the nation.

About 300 INS officers would be hired to investigate those who enter the country legally on visitor's visas but remain in the country beyond the permitted period. Such visa over-stayers--who typically arrive by airplane, not by hustling across the border--represent roughly half of the illegal immigrants in the country, the INS says.

Greg Abbott, the Texas governor, is expected to sign two right-wing immigration bills, setting off a likely constitutional battle over a new law that allows state and local police to arrest anyone suspected of crossing the Texas-Mexico border without documentation.

SB4, one of the harshest anti-immigration laws in US history, makes it a state crime to cross into Texas from another country without papers.

State judges are now required to order a migrant to return to the country they came from in lieu of prosecution. If the migrant refuses the judge's order, they could face a felony charge and up to 20 years in prison. SB4 also gives Texas officers the ability to arrest anyone who they believe has crossed into the state illegally, a power that immigrant advocates and Democrats have decried as racist.

""This is un-American,"" said Texas state representative Jolanda Jones, a Democrat. ""It will victimize people from the southern border, people of Latino descent.""

Jones told the Guardian that SB4 is ""state sanctioned"" racism against Latinos, noting that the new law does not contain a remedy for Americans who are wrongfully detained, arrested, or deported by sheriffs or state police.

""It will separate children from their parents,"" Jones said.

The controversial state law is the newest anti-immigration brainchild of Texas Republicans. In June,Abbott bussed migrants to Democratic-led cities without proper coordination. That same month, Texas launched Operation Lone Star, a multimillion-dollar initiative that has placed razor wire and thousands of troops at the Texas-Mexico border.

This week, the Republican governor is also slated to sign SB3, which allocates a whopping $1.5bn in tax dollars toward Texas border security measures. The high price tag of the new law ""includes paying for additional overtime expenses and costs"" of state troopers to patrol Colony Ridge, a housing development near Houston.

Colony Ridge became a focus of the Abbott administration after The Daily Wire, a far-right media outlet, called the development a ""magnet for illegal immigrants.""

Jones lambasted the new surge in border spending as fiscally irresponsible.

""This funding could and should be used to increase funding for public schools, public hospitals, neighborhood clinics, affordable housing, mental health facilities just to name a few,"" Jones told the Guardian.

Both anti-immigration laws have been widely criticized by Texas Democrats, but SB4 has also drawn condemnation from bipartisan legal groups and the Mexican government.

A group of more than two dozen former immigration judges signed a statement this week calling SB 4 unconstitutional. The signatories included judges who had been appointed by both Republican and Democratic administrations.

""Our personal politics may vary, but we dedicated our careers to the equal and fair administration of federal immigration law,"" the statement said, adding that SB4 should ""offend those who treasure our constitutional protections"".

Removing noncitizens from the US falls under the jurisdiction of the federal government. Immigration law is strictly the purview of the federal government, not individual states, in part because immigration is a major part of US foreign relations.

""Mexico in particular is a relationship that is important and central to how the federal government controls our border,"" said Emma Winger, deputy legal director of the American Immigration Council. ""What Texas is saying is that they are going to force people, many people who may not be Mexican citizens, to return to Mexico.""

In a statement released on 15 November, Mexico's secretary of foreign relations said the Mexican government ""categorically rejects"" SB4. Abbott's signature sets the stage for a standoff between Texas law enforcement officials and the federal government of Mexico.

Texas Republicans know that SB4 will likely invite legal challenges from either the Biden administration, immigration advocates, or both.

""Part of the reason for passing this law is to send a message to the Biden administration that Texas is going to go as far as it dares, and they don't care whether they lose in court, they're making a political statement,"" said Stephen Yale-Loehr, an immigration law professor at Cornell University.

Yale-Loehr said a legal challenge against SB4 would likely succeed, but court battles can take several years. In the meantime, Texas Republicans hope the threat of deportation will discourage migrants from crossing the southern border.

Immigration advocates like Yale-Loehr and Winger are especially concerned about the new law's interim effect on asylum seekers. Under federal law, all people who enter the United States have one year to apply for asylum, regardless of legal status. The new Texas statute means that undocumented immigrants in the process of applying for asylum could be deported from the United States, even if their case is still pending.

""These are people who have presented themselves to border patrol agents in hopes of getting legal protection here,"" Winger said. ""Texas is now saying that those people can be prosecuted, they can be jailed, and then they can be forcibly removed from the country.""","{'uri': 'theguardian.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","[{'uri': 'ava_sasani@theguardian.com', 'name': 'Ava Sasani', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': False}]",https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1917db324f8936d7cbce9ef21332d69d18beb016/0_0_5727_3436/master/5727.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&s=255017e5faad5297cd1a3468fa6a64d9,eng-9062380,-0.5137254901960784,51,51,The Guardian,theguardian.com

In nearly all of the major cases, Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. was in control, aligning sometimes with his fellow conservatives and at other times with the court's four liberals.

One surprise ruling extended the 1964 Civil Rights Act to protect LGBTQ employees, and another blocked President Trump's repeal of the Obama-era program that protects the so-called Dreamers, the young immigrants who were brought to this country as children.

The chief justice also cast the deciding vote to strike down a Louisiana law limiting abortions.

May a New York grand jury require President Trump's accountants and bankers to turn over records revealing his personal tax returns and financial dealings?

Yes, the court said in a 7-2 ruling in Trump vs. Vance. The chief justice rejected Trump's claim of ""absolute immunity"" and said the grand jury operating in secret may demand documents and records it needs to investigate potential crimes. Justices Clarence Thomas and Samuel A. Alito Jr. dissented.

May three House committees require the president and his accountants to turn over a massive amount of financial and banking records going back to 2010? No, or not until the committees demonstrate to a judge why all the records are needed and are relevant to new legislation, the court said in another 7-2 ruling in Trump vs. Mazars USA. Thomas and Alito dissented and said they would have blocked the subpoena.

Abortion and clinic doctors

May a state require that all doctors who perform abortions have admitting privileges at a hospital within 30 miles?

No, the court said in a 5-4 ruling in June Medical Services vs. Russo.

Justice Stephen G. Breyer, joined by the three other liberal justices, said the admitting privileges rule would do more harm than good for pregnant women because it would likely result in the closing of all but one of the state's abortion providers. The chief justice concurred in the outcome based on precedent: The court had struck down a nearly identical Texas law in 2016. In dissent were Justices Thomas, Alito, Neil M. Gorsuch and Brett M. Kavanaugh.

LGBTQ and workplace rights

Do the federal civil rights laws protect LGBTQ employees from discrimination in the workplace nationwide?

Yes, the court said in a 6-3 ruling citing the words of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. It says employers may not fire or refuse to hire employees based on their race, religion, sex or national origin. And the court decided that discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity is discrimination based on sex.

Justice Gorsuch wrote the court's opinion in Bostock vs. Clayton County. He agreed that lawmakers in 1964 may not have intended to protect gay, lesbian, bisexual, transgender or queer employees, but he said the court relies on the words of the law, not the aims of the lawmakers. Justices Thomas, Alito and Kavanaugh dissented.

Dreamers and immigration law

Did Trump lawfully repeal the Obama-era order that shielded young immigrants who were brought to this country as children?

No, the court said in a 5-4 ruling written by Chief Justice Roberts. He said that while the president had the legal authority to revoke the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA, his administration failed to give a reasoned explanation for ending a policy that encouraged about 700,000 immigrants to register with the government to obtain work permits and avoid deportation. While Trump could change policies, his administration did not comply with the Administrative Procedure Act, the court said in Department of Homeland Security vs. Regents of the University of California. Trump's aides had relied on former Atty. Gen. Jeff Sessions and his questionable claim that the policy was illegal from the start. In dissent were Justices Thomas, Alito, Gorsuch and Kavanaugh.

Religion and schools

May a state exclude church schools from a state-sponsored tuition aid program that supports students in other private schools, or does that exclusion amount to unconstitutional discrimination against religion?

That is unconstitutional discrimination based on religion, the court said in a 5-4 ruling in Espinoza vs. Montana. The Montana Supreme Court had blocked the $500 grants on the grounds that the state's constitution, like those of most states, forbids giving tax money to churches or their affiliates. But Chief Justice Roberts, writing for the court, said the discriminatory policy violates the 1st Amendment and its protection for the free exercise of religion. In dissent were Justices Breyer, Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan.

President and independent agencies

Did Congress violate the separation of powers and the president's executive authority when it created the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau in 2010 as an ""independent bureau,"" which would be led by a director who was appointed by the president but could not be fired except for ""neglect of duty or malfeasance in office.""

Yes, the court said in a 5-4 ruling in Seila Law vs. CFPB. Chief Justice Roberts said that putting a single director in charge of the agency and giving her a fixed term violates the president's executive authority. He said the president must be authorized to remove top officials. But the chief justice said his opinion did not extend to independent agencies which are governed by a board or by multiple commissioners.

Religion and teachers

Are church-run schools entitled to a religious exemption from federal anti-discrimination laws when it comes to hiring and firing teachers ?

Yes, the court said in a 7-2 ruling in Our Lady of Guadalupe School vs. Morrissey-Berru. The decision, based on two cases from Los Angeles County, tossed out discrimination lawsuits filed by two former teachers who taught fifth grade. Justice Alito, writing for the majority, said the 1st Amendment and its protection for the free exercise of religion means the government cannot tell a church whom to employ for positions at a church school if the church deems those jobs critical to its religious mission. Justices Ginsburg and Sotomayor dissented.

Electoral college and states

Can a state require its appointed electors to cast their presidential ballots in the electoral college for the candidate who won the most popular support in the state?

Yes, the court said in a 9-0 ruling in Chiafalo vs. Washington. The justices overturned a ruling by a federal appeals court in Denver which held that the Constitution as written in 1787 envisioned that electors were free to vote for their preferred presidential candidate. Writing for the court, Justice Kagan said that while that may been understood at the start, the electoral college became by the early 1800s a means of tallying the votes of the states. In nearly every state, all the electoral votes go to the presidential candidate who won the state's popular vote. The electors are ""not free agents,"" she said.

Religion and birth control

May the Trump administration exempt employers who cite religious or moral objections from part of the Affordable Care Act that requires providing no-cost contraceptives to employees?

Yes, the court said by a 7-2 vote in Little Sisters of the Poor vs. Pennsylvania. The decision overturned a ruling by the 3rd Circuit Court in Philadelphia which had blocked the Trump rule from taking effect on both legal and procedural grounds. Justice Thomas, writing for the majority, said the administration had the legal authority to carve out a broader religious exemption for employers. But the 3rd Circuit did not yet rule on whether the regulation violated the Administrative Procedure Act, so the ruling is not final. Justices Ginsburg and Sotomayor dissented.

Native Americans and crime

Does Oklahoma have the authority to prosecute serious crimes committed by Native Americans on land that was part of a historic reservation? No, the court said in a 5-4 ruling in McGirt vs. Oklahoma. Writing for the court, Justice Gorsuch said Congress had never disestablished or revoked the treaty that created the Creek Nation in eastern Oklahoma, and a federal law says U.S. authorities, not the state, have jurisdiction to prosecute serious crimes there committed by Native Americans. In dissent were Justices Roberts, Thomas, Alito and Kavanaugh.","{'uri': 'latimes.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'Los Angeles Times'}","[{'uri': 'david_g_savage@latimes.com', 'name': 'David G.

In a direct challenge to federal power over immigration, the Texas House on Thursday approved the creation of a state-level crime for entering the country from Mexico between ports of entry, allowing local police agencies to arrest and jail unauthorized migrants or order them back to Mexico.

The legislation had been called for by Gov. Greg Abbott in what would be a sharp escalation of his multibillion-dollar border security program, known as Operation Lone Star. The Texas House also approved an additional $1.5 billion for the state to use to construct its own barriers near the international boundary.

The arrest measure now returns to the Senate, which has already approved its own version, and then head to Mr. Abbott's desk for his signature.

""It is a humane, logical and efficient approach,"" Representative David Spiller, a Republican from west of Fort Worth, said in introducing his arrest bill before the vote. ""There is nothing unfair about ordering someone back from where they came if they arrived here illegally.""

Emotions ran high during hours of arguments and motions on the House floor that stretched through the night and into Thursday morning, with Democrats objecting to what they said would be a new criminal enforcement regime that could end up inadvertently targeting Hispanic Texans. At one point, tempers flared as Republicans moved to halt amendments to the bill.

""My community is being attacked,"" one Latino representative, Armando Walle, a Houston Democrat, told his Republican colleagues. ""Y'all don't understand,"" he said. ""It hurts us personally.""

For more than two years, Mr. Abbott and Republican lawmakers have been testing the boundaries of the state's power to enact its own aggressive law enforcement policies in response to the surging number of migrants crossing into the state from Mexico.

But the creation of a criminal offense under state law -- empowering Texas officers to arrest migrants, including those seeking asylum -- went a step further into a realm of immigration enforcement that is typically reserved to the federal government.

The legislative move is likely to set up a consequential court fight over immigration and, for opponents of President Biden's immigration policies, create a chance to revisit a 2012 Supreme Court case, originating in Arizona, that was decided 5 to 4 in favor of the federal government's primary role in setting immigration policy.

""The core question is whether the states can make it a crime to violate federal immigration law,"" said Josh Blackman, a constitutional law professor at South Texas College of Law Houston. ""That's the issue that Kennedy left open in 2012,"" he said, referring to Justice Anthony Kennedy, who wrote the Arizona decision.

State police officials in Texas have already discussed how they would use the new law to detain migrants caught crossing the Rio Grande, take them back to the international bridges and direct them to cross over into Mexico -- or else be arrested and charged.

During a House committee hearing on the legislation, Steve McCraw, the director of the Texas Department of Public Safety, said that large new jail facilities would not be needed to deal with a huge number of arrests if most people agreed to go back over the border. The more migrants taken to the bridges who are ""willing to voluntarily go over, the better,"" Mr. McCraw said.

Some legislators raised concern that arresting migrants for the state offense could have the effect of separating children from their parents, as occurred during the Trump administration when federal border agents strictly enforced the federal law barring unauthorized entry. Mr. McCraw said his state troopers would not conduct such arrests.

""We don't want to separate the mother from the child,"" Mr. McCraw said during the committee hearing.

Constitutional law experts said the legislation raised several potential conflicts with federal law and policymaking.

""How can the state take people who are not from Mexico, but have passed through Mexico, and order them to go to Mexico?"" said Gerald Neuman, a professor of law at Harvard University. ""Texas can't make Mexico take people that it has not agreed to take back.""

And, he added, states are not recognized as having the power to order people to leave the country.

The legislation does not provide exceptions for those arriving between the ports of entry who intend to make asylum claims to the federal government, an option that is enshrined in federal law.

""The asylum issue is a tricky one,"" Mr. Blackman said. ""It's a problem.""

It was not clear how the legislation would affect the existing coordination between Texas law enforcement officers and the U.S. Border Patrol. A large number of migrants who cross into Texas seek to immediately turn themselves in to federal border agents in order to make asylum claims.

Until recently, if state officers encountered them first, the officers usually alerted U.S. agents and handed them over for federal processing.

But in recent months, Texas National Guard members and state police officers have taken a more aggressive approach toward migrants attempting to cross the Rio Grande, laying down concertina wire along the riverbank and, in some cases, shouting at them to go back to Mexico.

And tensions have grown between state and federal officials over the state's placement of buoys in the river and the concertina wire, which some federal border agents have cut in order to assist migrants struggling in the river. On Tuesday, the Texas attorney general, Ken Paxton, sued the Biden administration over agents' cutting of the wire, saying the practice damaged Texas property and harmed the state's effort to deter migrant arrivals.

The new legislation authorizing arrests promises to up the ante even further.

""It will raise new tensions,"" said Aron Thorn, a senior attorney at the Texas Civil Rights Project.

The Texas House bill, known as H.B. 4, passed in the early hours of Thursday after Democrats repeatedly and unsuccessfully attempted to defeat or amend it.

While the legislation approved in the House differed in some details from a similar bill passed this month by the State Senate, both create the state-level offense, allowing for the arresting of migrants who cross between points of entry. A final version of the bill was expected to pass both chambers of the Legislature as early as this week.

Under the legislation, migrants believed to have crossed without authorization could be arrested even hundreds of miles from the border by local or state police officers.

""Not just D.P.S.,"" Mr. Walle, the Houston lawmaker, said in a telephone interview before the debate, referring to the Texas Department of Public Safety. ""Not just on the border. Now you're going to tie up local law enforcement agencies all over the state.""

He added that ""it puts fear into communities"" that otherwise want to work with law enforcement.

State troopers have, since 2021, been arresting some migrants found on private land on charges of criminal trespassing as part of Operation Lone Star.

The arrests, which originally focused exclusively on men, have been challenged by immigration and civil rights groups. When the program started, the arrests overwhelmed local jails. The state has since dedicated space in certain state prisons to house migrants facing trespassing charges.

Many of those migrants have found themselves eventually deported, Mr. Thorn said, though some have spent months in jail after being arrested on the misdemeanor trespassing charges.","{'uri': 'nytimes.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'The New York Times'}","[{'uri': 'j_david_goodman@nytimes.com', 'name': 'J.

Chairman Jim Jordan and immigration subcommittee Chairman Tom McClintock have written to Attorney General Merrick Garland requesting documents about the settlement announced last month in a lawsuit launched by the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) over the Trump administration's ""zero tolerance"" policy to prosecute all illegal entries at the border. That policy resulted in the separation of minors from their parents before it was ultimately reversed.

The settlement would block any future separations for eight years, while also providing authorization for parents of separated children to come to the U.S. under humanitarian parole for three years and work in the United States. The families receive housing aid for up to a year as well as healthcare and legal aid.

BIDEN ADMINISTRATION BORDER SETTLEMENT WITH ACLU WOULD LIMIT FUTURE SEPARATIONS FOR 8 YEARS

""The practice of separating families at the southwest border was shameful. This agreement will facilitate the reunification of separated families and provide them with critical services to aid in their recovery,"" Garland said in a statement at the time of the settlement.

But Jordan and McClintock accuse the administration of providing a ""grab-bag of U.S. taxpayers-funded services"" to illegal immigrants ""all because in 2018 the U.S. government prosecuted, under the existing criminal code enacted by Congress, illegal aliens for illegally entering the United States with their children.""

""As if the Department's stipulation is not egregious enough, the settlement also allows an illegal alien to escape criminal prosecution for illegally crossing the border solely because the alien is traveling with a child,"" they say. ""Because that legally dubious prohibition in the settlement lasts for eight years, it prevents future administrations from taking definitive steps to control the border.""

The lawmakers argue that it allows for a loophole to be exploited by cartels, amid an already ongoing crisis at the southern border, and say that it is already leading to cartels posing as minors' relatives to ensure entry into the U.S.

""The settlement will no doubt have a similar effect, with both children and the American people left to suffer because of the perverse incentives of President Biden's failed border policies,"" they say.

They are requesting documents related to decisions to provide social services and limit prosecutions to migrants, documents related to the consideration of payments to class members, and an explanation for the legal basis for limiting future administrations from adopting similar policies.

Separately, the Committee has also sent letters to a number of officials in the Executive Office of Immigration Review (EOIR), seeking transcribed interviews with multiple officials and immigration judges over its handling of the enormous immigration court backlog.

They highlight statistics showing that nearly half a million cases were dismissed, terminated or closed between Jan 2021 and July 2023, which they say raises ""serious questions"" about whether the agency is ""fairly, expeditiously, and uniformly interpreting and administering the Nation's immigration laws.

The letters come as the border continues to see sky-high numbers of migrants. There were more than 269,000 encounters in September, a new monthly record which also brought FY23 to the highest yearly encounter number on record. The Biden administration has called for more funding for border operations from Congress, including a recent $14 billion supplemental funding request.

The Serious Fraud Office (SFO) said over 80 of its investigators, accompanied by Metropolitan Police officers, conducted nine raids across the South East early on Tuesday morning to bring people in for questioning and search for possible evidence.

It comes after Axiom Ince was shut by the Solicitors Regulation Authority last month, when about £66 million of client money was found to be missing from its accounts and had been spent.

There are a number of significant questions that need to be answered. Clients from this law firm are missing many millions of pounds and more than 1,400 of its staff have lost their jobs. The impact on those affected is extremely serious Nick Ephgrave, SFO

The law firm employed more than 1,400 staff across 14 branches in England and Wales before it was closed.

Investigators will also look at how funds passed from Axiom's client accounts held with banking giant Barclays to the State of India to fund the purchases made with client cash.

Axiom Ince was founded in May this year when law firm Axiom DWFM bought corporate and commercial law firm Ince Group, as it was set to enter administration.

The US supreme court justice Clarence Thomas failed to repay much - or possibly all - of a ""sweetheart deal"" to borrow more than $267,000 to buy a luxury motor home, a Senate committee found.

The existence of the $267,230 loan, made by the businessman Anthony Welters in 1999 and forgiven in 2008, was first reported by the New York Times. On Wednesday, the Times quoted Michael Hamersley, a tax lawyer and congressional expert witness, as saying ""'this was, in short, a sweetheart deal' that made no logical sense from a business perspective"".

The original RV story came amid a torrent of reports, many by ProPublica, about alleged ethical lapses by Thomas, a conservative appointed in 1991 who has failed to declare numerous lavish gifts from rightwing donors.

Thomas denies wrongdoing but the reports, particularly concerning the mega-donor Harlan Crow, alongside stories about other justices' undeclared gifts and windfalls, have prompted questions about impartiality on the conservative-dominated court and calls for ethics reform.

Senate Democrats have proposed such reform but it has little chance of success, given Republican opposition. The chief justice, John Roberts, has resisted calls to testify.

Supreme court justices are nominally subject to the same ethics rules as all federal judges but in practice govern themselves.

In the case of the luxury RV - a Prevost Marathon Le Mirage XL - Welters loaned Thomas the money in 1999. The businessman told the Times: ""I loaned a friend money, as I have other friends and family. We've all been on one side or the other of that equation.""

But on Wednesday the Senate finance committee said it had now seen documents that showed an annual interest rate of 7.5% but no obligation to pay down the principal, only annual interest payments of $20,042. The committee also said it had seen a note from Thomas promising to abide by the terms.

""None of the documents reviewed by committee staff indicated that Thomas ever made payments to Welters in excess of the annual interest on the loan,"" the panel said.

As described by the Times, when the loan came due, in 2004, Welters granted a 10-year extension ""despite the fact that the previous year Justice Thomas had collected $500,000 of a $1.5m advance for his autobiography, according to his financial disclosures. Then, in late 2008, Mr Welters simply forgave the balance of the loan, according to the committee's report.""

A contemporaneous note, the committee said, showed Welters saying Thomas's ""interest only"" payments exceeded the value of the RV. But evidence did not back up this claim, with Welters having given investigators only one copy of a canceled check from Thomas, for the annual interest amount.

Hamersley told the Times: ""No bank behaving in a commercially reasonable, arms-length manner would have given that loan in the first place. And a bank doesn't just say, 'Oh gee, you've paid a lot in interest - we're good, no need to pay back what you actually owe.'""

Hamersley also said the Internal Revenue Service would treat any such gift as taxable income.

Ron Wyden, the Democratic chair of the Senate finance committee, said: ""Now we know that Justice Thomas had up to $267,230 in debt forgiven and never reported it on his ethics forms.

""Regular Americans don't get wealthy friends to forgive huge amounts of debt... Justice Thomas should inform the committee exactly how much debt was forgiven and whether he properly reported the loan forgiveness on his tax returns and paid all taxes owed.""

Calls for Thomas to resign, or to be impeached and removed, have proliferated. Such outcomes remain vastly unlikely but on Wednesday Caroline Ciccone, president of the watchdog Accountable.US, said Thomas had reached ""a new low"", the justice going ""about business as usual on the supreme court while skirting all ethics standards to cash in on his wealthy friends - to the tune of hundreds of thousands of dollars.

""Justice Thomas clearly views his position on our nation's highest court as a chance to upgrade his own lifestyle with no consequences. As becomes more clear by the day, he is unfit to serve on our high court. Justice Thomas must resign.""","{'uri': 'theguardian.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","[{'uri': 'martin_pengelly@theguardian.com', 'name': 'Martin Pengelly', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': False}]",https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/37f3c27862c00dd30f30791cee0e554cbf623c9f/0_164_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&s=97d0422fb258274f97210d74df250c11,eng-9004553,0.388235294117647,76,76,The Guardian,theguardian.com

Philip Postlewaite, 78, filed his lawsuit in a Chicago federal court on Tuesday, claiming that he has been awarded ""substantially"" lower increases to his base pay than have less experienced faculty colleagues since 2013 when he declined a buyout offer.

He began teaching tax law at Northwestern University Pritzker School of Law in 1981 and created its Tax LL.M. program in 2002, of which he is the director, according to his complaint.

Postlewaite said in his complaint that his base salary this year was $7,000 below the law school's median of $289,224 and $55,000 below the top 25% of salaries, which was $337,256. Those figures were obtained from Northwestern, the complaint said.

The professors earning those higher salaries had far fewer years of teaching experience than Postlewaite, who has been teaching law for 49 years -- 42 of which have been at Northwestern -- the complaint said.

A Northwestern University spokesperson on Thursday said the university does not comment on pending litigation. Postlewaite did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Postlewaite filed a complaint with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission and the Illinois Department of Human Rights in February and obtained a right to sue in August. The EEOC complaint claims that Postlewaite brought up his pay concerns with law dean Hari Osofsky in March 2022 but that she ""did not see a basis for adjustment,"" to his salary after a review.

""I believe instead of compensating me and other long-term older faculty members who have remained productive and dedicated, the law school uses its money to recruit and retain younger professors,"" Postlewaite wrote in his EEOC complaint.

The 9-0 ruling upholds a 1987 move by Congress to apply tax changes retroactively to returns that were filed in 1986. It is a defeat for a Newport Beach estate tax lawyer who lost $630,000 in estate money when he sold stocks in 1986 to take advantage of a newly created tax deduction.

A year later, when Congress repealed the new deduction, the Internal Revenue Service demanded that the estate pay an extra $2.5 million in taxes. The case came to the high court as a test of how far the government could go in imposing tax changes retroactively.

""Tax legislation is not a promise, and a taxpayer has no vested right in the Internal Revenue Code,"" said Justice Harry A. Blackmun for the court. So long as Congress acts with ""a legitimate legislative purpose"" in mind, its tax laws, even retroactive ones, are constitutional, he said.

In a concurring opinion, Justice Antonin Scalia derided the government for ""bait-and-switch taxation,"" but he nonetheless voted to uphold the law.

The Constitution itself bars ex post facto laws. Since 1798, the Supreme Court has said that limit applies only to criminal laws, not civil measures.

Indeed, since the 1930s, the high court repeatedly has upheld retroactive tax changes. But some tax experts had hoped that a conservative-dominated court would be more protective of the rights of taxpayers. Instead, Monday's ruling (United States vs. Carlton, 92-1941) offers another stark example of a conservative court handing down a defeat to a cause championed by political conservatives.

The decision probably deals a fatal blow to a similar lawsuit challenging retroactive tax increases in the 1993 Clinton tax bill.

Last year, Republicans in Congress argued that the Democratic majority was acting unconstitutionally when it raised tax rates on the estates of people who died in the months before the new tax bill became law. On Aug. 10, 1993, President Clinton signed into law the higher tax rates for estates and for upper-income people. Those new rates were applied retroactively to Jan. 1, 1993.

Lawyers for the National Taxpayers Union and the Landmark Legal Foundation filed a lawsuit in federal court here seeking to have those retroactive changes invalidated.

The conservative members of the high court, led by Scalia and Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist, long have insisted on giving wide latitude to elected lawmakers. Whether the issues are contraception and abortion or rent control and retroactive taxes, these two conservatives have largely voted to uphold federal and state laws.

In his concurring opinion, Scalia lectured the liberals for ""picking and choosing among the various rights to be accorded (special) protection,"" citing the Roe vs. Wade decision that made abortion legal as an example. In his view, the court should uphold state laws banning abortion, just as it upheld a law Monday that imposed retroactive taxes. Justice Clarence Thomas joined Scalia's opinion.

Jerry Carlton, the Newport Beach tax lawyer who lost in Monday's ruling, said that he found the decision ""scary. As I read it, it says the government can say: 'I have a social goal. Help me accomplish it.' But after you do it, they can say: 'Sorry! Just kidding.' ""

The social goal in this instance was encouraging employee stock ownership programs, or ESOPs. Former Sen. Russell Long (D-La.) believed that workers should own more of a company's stock and he wrote into law tax incentives to achieve that goal.

In the Tax Reform Act of 1986, he sponsored a change that gave a deduction to estate executors who sell stock to an employee stock ownership plan. The idea was that the deduction would encourage sales at a discount.

Carlton, the executor of the estate of oil heiress Willametta Keck Day, bought $11.2 million in MCI stock and sold it two days later to the company ESOP for $10.57 million. Though he lost $631,000 on the stock transaction, the estate got a tax deduction valued at $2.5 million when he filed her return on Dec. 29, 1986.

But IRS officials, alarmed at estimates that the new deduction could cost $7 billion over five years, announced in January, 1987, that they would seek a change in the law. In December, 1987, Congress passed an amendment limiting the deduction to estates that owned the stock before death.

The IRS then sought a $2.5-million refund from the Day's estate. After the tax was paid, Carlton challenged the action as a violation of due process of law.","{'uri': 'latimes.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'Los Angeles Times'}","[{'uri': 'david_g_savage@latimes.com', 'name': 'David G.

AG hits back at Jordan, Comer in Leonard Leo probe","On Oct. 30, GOP Reps. Jim Jordan (R-Ohio) and James Comer (R-Ky.), chairs of the House Judiciary and Oversight committees, respectively, demanded all materials from Schwalb related to Leo.

In his letter, Schwalb rejected both the request and its premise -- that any probe might be politically motivated. ""Contrary to your letter's suggestion, [the office] is committed to the impartial pursuit of justice, without regard to political affiliation or motivation and without fear or favor,"" wrote Schwalb.

It's the latest attempt by Leo allies to throw sand in the gears of Schwalb's investigation. (Though in keeping with law enforcement protocol, Schwalb still has not confirmed or denied its existence.) Whether the probe uncovers wrongdoing is significant given the sheer scale of Leo's work: He is also the beneficiary of a $1.6 billion contribution, believed to be the biggest political donation in U.S. history.

Jordan and Comer had claimed it appears Schwalb does not have jurisdiction to investigate nonprofits and other entities that were incorporated outside of Washington, D.C.

""I am concerned that your letter may misapprehend jurisdiction over nonprofit organizations operating in the District,"" Schwalb said. ""No corporation, whether for-profit or not-for-profit, is exempt from the laws of a jurisdiction in which it chooses to be present and do business.""

Leo's attorney previously told POLITICO his client is not cooperating with Schwalb's investigation.

Leo's network of nonprofits, often referred to as ""dark money"" groups, are exempt from tax and do not have to disclose their donors because they are registered as charitable or social welfare organizations. They spent hundreds of millions of dollars on campaigns to promote the nominations of Justices Neil Gorsuch, Brett Kavanaugh and Amy Coney Barrett. But many partisan groups operate as nonprofits shielded from federal tax, and that's not why Schwalb is investigating.

In March. POLITICO reported that a total of $43 million flowed to Leo's company, CRC Advisors, over two years and that the bulk of it came from one of his charitable groups, The 85 Fund. A few months later, a Democrat-aligned watchdog group filed a complaint with the IRS and with Schwalb's office alleging the total amount of money that flowed from Leo-aligned nonprofits to his for-profit firms was $73 million over six years beginning in 2016. That's the year Leo was tapped as an unpaid judicial adviser to former President Donald Trump.

A review of real estate and other public records also illustrated that the lifestyle of Leo and a handful of his allies took a lavish turn beginning the same year.

Jordan has also tried to investigate prosecutors going after former President Donald Trump. The congressman issued a similar demand to Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis in Georgia, which she strongly rebuked, as well as to special counsel Jack Smith related to the federal prosecution of Trump over his handling of classified documents.

In his letter, Schwalb told Comer and Jordan that potential abuse of nonprofit tax laws is a serious offense. ""Because nonprofits are supported by tax-exempt contributions, they operate as a public trust. For that reason, every nonprofit registered and doing business in the District must use the funds it receives solely for its stated public purpose, and not for the private inurement or benefit of others,"" he said.

The idea that Schwalb doesn't have jurisdiction -- disputed by nonprofit tax law experts -- was first floated in a letter from a group of Republican attorneys general who based their claim on the fact that The 85 Fund was first incorporated outside of the District of Columbia. Their argument was picked up in a Wall Street Journal opinion editorial.

But the Leo-aligned group, previously called the Judicial Education Project, operated from a Washington, D.C. PO Box in Georgetown for more than a decade. CRC Advisors is also registered in DC. The biggest funder of the Republican Attorneys General Association so far in 2023 is a Leo-aligned group, the Concord Fund, which has given RAGA at least $9.5 million since 2020.

Nonprofit legal experts say the argument seeking to discredit Schwalb's investigative authority isn't credible.

""The D.C. Attorney General has very broad jurisdiction over business in D.C.,"" said Yael Fuchs, who was a senior lawyer on a New York case against the National Rifle Association's alleged abuse of nonprofit tax law.

""Nonprofits generally are governed by multiple legal systems -- the laws of the state where they are incorporated, the laws of the jurisdictions in which they conduct business, and if federally tax-exempt, by the Internal Revenue Code,"" Fuchs said in an email to POLITICO. ""The D.C. Attorney General has very broad jurisdiction over business in DC,"" she said.

The group at issue, The 85 Fund, quietly relocated in recent months from the capital area to Texas, where it is unlikely to face the same scrutiny.","{'uri': 'politico.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'POLITICO'}",[],https://static.politico.com/9b/84/2950b4464c2d99e933f2c973df04/house-republicans-press-conference-on-investigating-hunter-biden-77649.jpg,,0.1686274509803922,51,51,POLITICO,politico.com

The non-binding opinion is seen as a significant setback to Ireland's defence of its past tax treatment of the US technology giant.

However, the country's finance minister said it is still Ireland's position that the correct amount of Irish tax was paid.

In 2016, following an EU investigation which launched in 2014, the commission concluded that Ireland gave undue tax benefits to Apple, which would be illegal under EU state aid rules.

Ireland and Apple fought the commission on the matter and in July 2020, the General Court of the European Union annulled the decision.

However, the European Commission subsequently appealed against the decision to the European Court of Justice (CJEU) saying the lower court's ruling was legally incorrect.

On Thursday, Giovanni Pitruzzella, an advocate general at the CJEU, agreed that the earlier ruling had contained ""a series of errors in law"".

He said the judgment should be set aside and referred the case back to the General Court for a new decision.

While the opinion of the advocate general is non-binding, it is usually followed by the court and therefore could have significant implications for corporation tax bills.

The commission's original position was that that tax rulings issued by Ireland to Apple in 1991 and 2007 substantially and artificially lowered the tax paid by the iPhone manufacturer in the country since the early 90s, in a way which did not correspond to economic reality.

As a result, competition commissioner Margrethe Vestager said Ireland had granted illegal tax benefits which enabled it to pay substantially less tax than other business over many years.

The investigation found that Apple had paid an effective corporate tax rate of 1% on its European profits in 2003, down to 0.005% in 2014, 50 euro for every one million euro of profit.

The process involved recording almost all sales profits of two Irish incorporated companies, which the commission said only existed on paper.

The companies, fully owned by Apple, held the rights to use the firm's intellectual property to manufacture and sell its products outside North and South America.

The commission said this situation allowed Apple to avoid taxation on almost all profits generated by sales of its products in the entire EU single market.

It said this was due to Apple's decision to record all sales in Ireland rather than in the countries where the products were sold.

The findings were disputed by the Irish State, which said all tax owed had been collected, and Apple, which had come under scrutiny in the US for its tax practices years earlier.

At the time, Apple's chief executive, Tim Cook, branded the EU findings as ""political crap"", maddening and untrue.

The Irish Government, which was also used to defending a comparatively low 12.5% corporation tax rate, said Europe had overstepped the mark in attempting to dictate tax laws and enforce retrospective taxes decades later.

Ireland and Apple fought the commission on the matter and in July 2020, the General Court of the European Union annulled the decision.

The General Court found that the commission had not shown that there was an advantage deriving from the adoption of the tax rulings.

However, the commission subsequently appealed the decision to the European Court of Justice with Ms Vestager saying the lower court's ruling contained errors of law.

On Thursday, the advocate general agreed the General Court had erred when it ruled that the Commission had not shown to the requisite legal standard that the intellectual property licences held by the two incorporated companies and related profits, generated by the sales of Apple products outside the US, had to be attributed for tax purposes to the Irish branches.

The advocate general was of the view that the General Court also failed to assess correctly the substance and consequences of certain methodological errors that, according to the Commission decision, ""vitiated the tax rulings"".

It is the non-binding opinion of Mr Pitruzzella that it is necessary for the General Court to carry out a new assessment.

The decision of the CJEU on the matter is expected next year and will have significant implications for how member states grant tax breaks to major firms.

Apple has argued it has been paying tax on the profits in question in the US, while Ireland has seen it necessary to defend its reputation on taxation issues to protect foreign direct investment.

On Thursday, Finance Minister Michael McGrath said the Government's legal team will consider the opinion of the advocate general at Europe's top court ""in detail"".

Minister McGrath said: ""I note the opinion of the advocate general. It is important to bear in mind that this opinion does not form part of the Court of Justice of the European Union judgment but is considered by the court when arriving at its final ruling.

""My department and the State's legal team will consider the full Opinion of the Advocate General in detail.

""It has always been, and remains, Ireland's position that that the correct amount of Irish tax was paid and that Ireland provided no State aid to Apple.

""We now await the judgment of the Court of Justice of the European Union on this matter.""

He had previously said ""there was no sweetheart deal"".

In the interim, the 13.1 billion euro has been held in an escrow fund pending the outcome of the case.

The money, with interest, is due to be entered into the Irish exchequer if the commission wins the case.

Neal dies at 81; formidable lawyer won victories on both sides of courtroom,"James F. Neal, a formidable lawyer who won noteworthy victories on both sides of the courtroom -- as a prosecutor he sent Teamsters leader Jimmy Hoffa and top Watergate figures to prison, and as a defense attorney he saved film director John Landis and Ford Motor Co. from serious criminal charges -- died Thursday at a Nashville hospital. He was 81.

The cause was esophageal cancer, said his longtime law partner, Aubrey B. Harwell.

Neal's reputation for tenacity and brilliance in the courtroom began with the 1964 prosecution of Hoffa, who had successfully fended off two dozen indictments until Neal, a stocky, cigar-chomping ex-Marine with a Tennessee drawl, was assigned to his case. Hoffa called him ""the most vicious prosecutor who ever lived,"" a slur that Neal considered a badge of honor.

A decade later, Neal was chief prosecutor in the Watergate case, turning in a virtuoso performance that resulted in the convictions of former Atty. Gen. John Mitchell and top Nixon White House aides H.R. Haldeman and John Ehrlichman.

When he returned to private practice in Tennessee, famous clients sought his counsel, including Landis, who faced manslaughter charges when actor Vic Morrow and two child actors were killed in a 1982 helicopter crash during filming of the movie ""Twilight Zone,"" and Ford, the first automaker to be charged with murder when the rear-end crash of a Pinto resulted in three deaths.

Neal also successfully defended Dr. George Nichopoulous on charges that he overprescribed medications to Elvis Presley, whose drug use was implicated in his 1977 death.

""I don't think any lawyer in this era had as many high-profile cases tried as successfully as Jim Neal,"" Harwell said Friday. ""The real thing that made him different was if he had to work all night to examine a witness, he worked all night. He was totally dedicated and absolutely committed to winning.""

Time magazine wrote of Neal's unwavering focus preparing for the Watergate trial, noting that he ""often put in 10-hour days with a single Watergate witness, then worked on into the night cross-checking each statement."" He was in the midst of one such marathon session with White House counsel John Dean when Dean's wife broke in to ask about her husband's reaction to President Ford's pardon of Nixon that morning. Neal, the magazine reported, asked, ""What pardon?""

Born on Sept. 7, 1929, in Oak Grove, Tenn., Neal grew up on a small family farm, where he rose at 4 a.m. every day to perform three hours of chores before school. He earned a bachelor's degree in 1952 from the University of Wyoming and served two years in the Marines before obtaining a law degree in 1957 from Vanderbilt University. He also had a master's degree in tax law from Georgetown University.

He was diverted from his intended career as a tax lawyer in 1961, when Atty. Gen. Robert F. Kennedy recruited him to investigate corruption charges against the Teamsters union.

The first case Neal tried against Hoffa ended in a mistrial. The judge suspected Hoffa of bribing a juror, which gave Neal something to work with for the government's next prosecution.

""Hoffa was the toughest old bird I ever met,"" Neal told the American Bar Assn. journal last year. ""Every morning I would sit down at the prosecution table, look over at the defense, and Hoffa would shoot me a secret finger message under the table.""

The two trials with Hoffa were as dramatic as an episode of ""Perry Mason."" The first trial, in 1962, was interrupted by a deranged gunman who shot up the courtroom with a gas pellet gun. Everyone ducked except Hoffa, who, according to Neal, charged the gunman and punched him in the face.

In the 1964 trial, the drama was supplied by the prosecution's surprise witness, Edward Partin, secretary-treasurer of a Teamsters unit in Baton Rouge, La., and a confidant of Hoffa. Partin, who had worked undercover for the government during the previous trial, testified that Hoffa had told him he had at least $15,000 to bribe the jury. Hoffa was convicted of jury tampering and received an eight-year sentence.

When special prosecutor Archibald Cox called in 1973 to ask Neal's help in the Watergate case, Neal was reluctant to leave his private practice in Nashville. He agreed to come to Washington for two weeks to help Cox get started but wound up moving in for a year, unable to resist what he later described as ""the fastest game in town.""

His final argument in the trial was so compelling that Haldeman's lawyer, John Wilson, grimly joked, ""Could you hear the prison doors clanking shut?"" Wilson, in a Time magazine interview, said Neal was ""the greatest lawyer I ever saw in a courtroom.""

In 1990, he defended Exxon Corp. after the Exxon Valdez oil tanker spilled thousands of gallons of oil in Alaska's Prince William Sound. That trial, which ended in a multimillion-dollar verdict for victims of the spill, was one of Neal's few big losses, and he hated defeat. ""I just shrivel up; instead of 5 foot 8, I become 5 foot 6,"" he once said about losing.

Watergate was by far his most important case, but he said that it was the only time a victory made him sad.

""There will only be one Watergate case. Whether a man is a defendant or an unindicted co-conspirator, you're trying him because you have to prove conspiracy, so you're trying the president of the United States,"" he told People magazine in 1980. ""That doesn't happen very often.""

He is survived by his wife, Dianne; three children; and five grandchildren.","{'uri': 'latimes.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'Los Angeles Times'}","[{'uri': 'elaine_woo@latimes.com', 'name': 'Elaine Woo', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': False}]",https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/64e287b/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2400x1260+0+0/resize/1200x630!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fdf%2F45%2F57d858144a2a88575fa2b03080bb%2Flatlogo-ss.jpg,,0.08235294117647052,29,29,Los Angeles Times,latimes.com

Please try again later{{ /verifyErrors }}

EU lawmakers are awaiting an announcement which is seen as major step in the drawn-out dispute over tax arrangements between technology giant Apple and Ireland.

The advocate general at the European Court of Justice is to issue an opinion on Friday morning about whether Apple will be forced to pay more than 13 billion euro in back taxes to Ireland.

While the opinion of the advocate general is non-binding, it is usually followed by the court and therefore could have significant implications for corporation tax bills.

Ireland had fought the European Commission over the matter due to concerns over an intrusion on Irish sovereignty and potential impacts to investment in the country.

In 2016, following an EU investigation which launched in 2014, the commission concluded that Ireland gave undue tax benefits of 13.1 billion euro to Apple, which is illegal under EU state aid rules.

The commission said that tax rulings issued by Ireland to Apple in 1991 and 1997 substantially and artificially lowered the tax paid by the iPhone manufacturer in the country since 1991, in a way which did not correspond to economic reality.

As a result, competition commissioner Margrethe Vestager said Ireland had granted illegal tax benefits which enabled it to pay substantially less tax than other business over many years.

The investigation found that Apple had paid an effective corporate tax rate of 1% on its European profits in 2003, down to 0.005% in 2014 - 50 euro for every one million euro of profit.

The process involved recording almost all sales profits of two Irish incorporated companies, which the commission said only existed on paper.

The companies, fully owned by Apple, held the rights to use the firm's intellectual property to manufacture and sell its products outside North and South America.

The commission said this situation allowed Apple to avoid taxation on almost all profits generated by sales of its products in the entire EU single market.

It said this was due to Apple's decision to record all sales in Ireland rather than in the countries where the products were sold.

The findings were disputed by the Irish State - which said all tax owed had been collected - and Apple, which had come under scrutiny in the US for its tax practices years earlier.

At the time, Apple's chief executive, Tim Cook, branded the EU findings as ""political crap"", maddening and untrue.

The Irish Government, which was also used to defending a comparatively low 12.5% corporation tax rate, said Europe had overstepped the mark in attempting to dictate tax laws and enforce retrospective taxes decades later.

Ireland and Apple fought the commission on the matter and in July 2020, the General Court of the European Union annulled the decision.

However, the commission subsequently appealed the decision to the European Court of Justice with Ms Vestager saying the lower court's ruling contained ""errors of law"".

The European Court of Justice's advocate general is to give a legal opinion on the dispute ahead of the court's final decision.

That decision is expected next year and will have significant implications for how member states grant tax breaks to major firms.

Apple has argued it has been paying tax on the profits in question in the US, while Ireland has seen it necessary to defend its reputation on taxation issues to protect foreign direct investment.

Last weekend, Finance Minister Michael McGrath said the advocate general's opinion will be ""significant"" but added it is not the final step in the process.

Mr McGrath said: ""We are confident in our position in respect of the Apple case. We take encouragement from the findings they have made so far, but it is a significant day.""

He added: ""There was no sweetheart deal. This was the application of Ireland's statutory corporation tax code.""

In the interim, the 13.1 billion euro has been held in an escrow fund pending the outcome of the case.

The money, with interest, is due to be entered into the Irish exchequer if the commission wins the case.

However, other member states may make claims that they are owed some of the money.

If the commission loses the appeal, the large sum will be returned to Apple.","{'uri': 'independent.co.uk', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'The Independent'}",[],https://static.independent.co.uk/2023/11/09/02/2c0f5f1713646fc10d445bba6121530aY29udGVudHNlYXJjaGFwaSwxNjk5NTYzNTky-2.22078004.jpg?quality=75&width=1200&auto=webp,eng-9045967,-0.1215686274509804,26,26,The Independent,independent.co.uk

In 2008, nine years after Thomas' friend Anthony Welters lent him money to purchase a motorhome, the health care executive forgave the balance of the loan, according to a report from Democrats on the Senate Finance Committee.

""While additional documents pertaining to the loan agreement may exist, documents reviewed by Democratic staff suggest that Justice Thomas did not repay a significant portion of the loan principal,"" the report said.

The allegation comes as Thomas remains under scrutiny for his failure to disclose gifts and luxury trips that he accepted from Republican donor Harlan Crow and amid debate over whether the Supreme Court should adopt an ethics code.

Democrats launched their inquiry after the New York Times reported the loan's existence in August.

When Thomas borrowed the money in 1999, he agreed to pay 7.5% interest a year and fully repay the loan within five years, the Senate report says, citing information and documents voluntarily provided by Welters. In 2004, the loan repayment period was extended another 10 years.

But Welters forgave the balance of the loan in 2008 ""in recognition of the payments made by Thomas which Welters characterized as interest only payments that exceeded the amount of the original loan,"" the report said.

Welters told Thomas in a handwritten note that he ""did not feel it was appropriate to continue to accept payments even though he had the right to them,"" according to the report.

The report said Welters provided only one receipt of payment, which showed that Thomas paid him $20,042 in 2000 -- the amount of one yearly interest payment.

Nine years of interest payments would have totaled about $180,400.

The committee said it was not given additional documents that could offer more clarity on the agreement.

""None of the documents reviewed by committee staff indicated that Thomas ever made payments to Welters in excess of the annual interest on the loan,"" it said.

Senate Finance Chairman Ron Wyden of Oregon said the committee wants answers from Thomas, but said he hasn't made a decision about whether to subpoena the Supreme Court justice.

""What we need to know is Justice Thomas' justification for this,"" Wyden said Wednesday. ""Why wouldn't he put this on ethics forms? What has he done with respect to tax laws?

In 2016, following an EU investigation which launched in 2014, the commission concluded that Ireland gave undue tax benefits to Apple, which would be illegal under EU state aid rules.

Ireland and Apple fought the commission on the matter and in July 2020, the General Court of the European Union annulled the decision.

However, the European Commission subsequently appealed against the decision to the European Court of Justice (CJEU) saying the lower court's ruling was legally incorrect.

On Thursday, Giovanni Pitruzzella, an advocate general at the CJEU, agreed that the earlier ruling had contained ""a series of errors in law"".

He said the judgment should be set aside and referred the case back to the General Court for a new decision.

While the opinion of the advocate general is non-binding, it is usually followed by the court and therefore could have significant implications for corporation tax bills.

The commission's original position was that that tax rulings issued by Ireland to Apple in 1991 and 2007 substantially and artificially lowered the tax paid by the iPhone manufacturer in the country since the early 90s, in a way which did not correspond to economic reality.

As a result, competition commissioner Margrethe Vestager said Ireland had granted illegal tax benefits which enabled it to pay substantially less tax than other business over many years.

Ireland and Apple fought the commission on the matter and in July 2020, the General Court of the European Union annulled the decision.

The General Court found that the commission had not shown that there was an advantage deriving from the adoption of the tax rulings.

However, the commission subsequently appealed the decision to the European Court of Justice with Ms Vestager saying the lower court's ruling contained errors of law.

On Thursday, the advocate general agreed the General Court had erred when it ruled that the Commission had not shown to the requisite legal standard that the intellectual property licences held by the two incorporated companies and related profits, generated by the sales of Apple products outside the US, had to be attributed for tax purposes to the Irish branches.

The advocate general was of the view that the General Court also failed to assess correctly the substance and consequences of certain methodological errors that, according to the Commission decision, ""vitiated the tax rulings"".

It is the non-binding opinion of Mr Pitruzzella that it is necessary for the General Court to carry out a new assessment.

The decision of the CJEU on the matter is expected next year and will have significant implications for how member states grant tax breaks to major firms.

Ginsburg, who had battled cancer for more than a decade, died Friday evening due to complications of the disease, the U.S. Supreme Court announced. She was 87.

A feminist hero lovingly dubbed Notorious RBG, Ginsburg emerged over the last decade as the leading voice of the court's liberal wing, best known for her stinging dissents on a bench that has mostly skewed right since her 1993 appointment.

""Our nation has lost a jurist of historic stature. We at the Supreme Court have lost a cherished colleague,"" Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. said. ""Today we mourn, but with confidence that future generations will remember Ruth Bader Ginsburg as we knew her -- a tireless and resolute champion of justice.""

Her death in the middle of the presidential campaign sets the stage for a momentous fight over whether President Trump and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) can replace her with a conservative jurist before the November election.

McConnell has already said he intends to have a vote, although he did not say when it would be held. It remains unclear whether enough Republicans would go along with such a move, and Democrats are certain to oppose it. McConnell refused to consider President Obama's Supreme Court nominee during the 2016 election year, saying the new president should decide.

Ginsburg's health had been precarious for more than a decade. She was successfully treated for cancer of the colon, pancreas and lung, but had a recurrence of pancreatic cancer in the spring.

Some liberal activists had urged her to retire in 2014, when Obama could have chosen her successor. But she said she was determined to serve as long as her health permitted.

President Trump had just finished speaking at a campaign rally in Minnesota when he was told of Ginsburg's death.

""She just died? Wow. I didn't know that,"" he said. ""She led an amazing life. What else can you say? She was an amazing woman.... I'm sad to hear that.""

He made no immediate comment about whether he would move to replace her.

Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden called Ginsburg ""not only a giant in the legal profession, but a beloved figure. ... And she practiced the highest American ideals as a justice: equality and justice under the law, and Ruth Bader Ginsburg stood for all of us.""

Biden said whoever is elected in November should choose her replacement.

""This was the position the Republican Senate took in 2016 when there were almost 10 months to go before the election,"" he said. ""That's the position the United States Senate must take today. The election is only 46 days off.""

Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D- Calif.), the ranking Democrat on the Senate Judiciary Committee, said the nation had ""lost a truly amazing woman tonight, a trailblazer for women, a once-in-generation legal mind and a passionate champion for the rights of all Americans.

""Under no circumstances should the Senate consider a replacement for Justice Ginsburg until after the presidential inauguration,"" she said.

For her first two decades, Ginsburg was a respected but not highly influential member of the high court -- a reliable liberal vote who was often overshadowed by Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, the first female justice and the court's swing vote.

But after O'Connor and Justice John Paul Stevens retired, Ginsburg became a major force on the court, her soft voice and diminutive stature belying a biting tongue and inexhaustible energy that pushed her to work through numerous health scares, including a 2018 fall that left her with broken ribs.

She wrote several major decisions, including a 1996 ruling in U.S. vs. Virginia that opened the doors of Virginia Military Institute to women and struck down discriminatory admissions policies of state-run schools. She supported abortion rights, gay rights, affirmative action and the strict separation of church and state.

But Ginsburg was best known for her impassioned dissents, which she often delivered in court while wearing a special dark, beaded ""dissent collar"" over her traditional black robe.

She called it ""hubris"" in 2013 when the court's five conservatives struck down a key part of the Voting Rights Act as outdated. Tossing out the protection, she said, ""is like throwing away your umbrella in a rainstorm because you are not getting wet.""

A year later, she slammed the same five for ruling that Hobby Lobby Corp. had a religious-freedom right not to pay for legally required contraceptives for their employees. Corporations do not have religious views, she said, and Congress ""left healthcare decisions -- including the choice among contraceptive methods -- in the hands of women.""

During oral arguments over a 2013 gay marriage case, Ginsburg said the government's Defense of Marriage Act effectively had set up an unfair, two-tier system.

""There are two kinds of marriage: full marriage and the skim-milk marriage,"" she said.

In that case, she was part of the majority that overturned the federal law.

Perhaps her most notable dissent came in 2007, when Ginsburg -- then the only female justice -- described herself as ""all alone in [her] corner of the bench"" following O'Connor's retirement.

A five-member majority had overturned a sex discrimination verdict in favor of Lilly Ledbetter, an Alabama woman who was paid far less than the men who held the same job at Goodyear Tire plants. The majority ruled that Ledbetter had waited too long to file her complaint, though that was because she had been unaware of the disparity.

Ginsburg, in dissent, said the majority ""does not comprehend, or is indifferent to, the insidious way in which women can be victims of pay discrimination."" Its interpretation of the law ""ignored the realities"" of the workplace and betrayed the ""core purposes"" of the Civil Rights Act, she said.

Ginsburg said Congress should act to correct the court's mistake, and two years later the House and Senate passed the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act, providing more time to file claims. It was the first measure signed into law by President Obama.

Well into her 80s, Ginsburg was surprised and delighted to discover she had become a celebrity, particularly among a new generation of women. Her appearances at universities and law schools drew large, adoring crowds, and her face adorned with a crown was featured on T-shirts and coffee mugs. She was the subject of several films, including ""RBG,"" a documentary.

""It seemed that her dissents had really connected with a lot of people, especially millennials,"" Betsy West, a co-director of the film, said after its release. ""It's this incongruousness of an 85-year-old Jewish grandmother who is speaking truth to power.""

At times, her frankness backfired. In a 2016 interview, Ginsburg called Donald Trump, then the Republican presidential nominee, a ""faker,"" saying: ""He has no consistency about him. He says whatever comes into his head at the moment. He really has an ego.""

Such criticism of a political candidate was highly unusual for a sitting Supreme Court justice, and Ginsburg apologized.

There was also friction between Ginsburg and some liberals in 2014, when pressure grew for her to retire while Democrats still held the Senate and the White House, which could guarantee that her seat would be filled by another liberal. Ginsburg brushed aside such concerns and let it be known she was not going anywhere, saying she still had a lot to contribute to the court.

In 2014, Republicans claimed the Senate majority, and two years after that the White House was won by Trump, who had promised to appoint only conservative, anti-abortion justices.

Ginsburg was the first Democratic nominee to the high court in a quarter of a century when she was chosen in 1993 by President Clinton.

Ironically, she was not immediately embraced by liberals and women's rights activists. Some feared she was too moderate, and others were concerned by Ginsburg's past criticism of the landmark abortion ruling Roe vs. Wade.

But Ginsburg's objections were not about the outcome of the ruling. Rather, she believed the court's opinion should have been based on more solid legal footing, namely a woman's right to equal treatment under the 14th Amendment rather than a court-created ""right to privacy.""

In her interview for the appointment, Ginsburg impressed Clinton, who hailed her as the Thurgood Marshall of the women's rights movement.

Where Marshall, before he became the nation's first African American justice, led the legal fight against racial discrimination in the 1940s and '50s, Ginsburg led the legal fight against sex discrimination in the 1970s.

""She helped us read our Constitution to understand that it protects us all,"" Yale Law professor Judith Resnik said. ""She brought vision, skill, intellect and kindness to the law.""

Ginsburg grew up at a time when the law treated men and women differently. And though racial discrimination came to be widely seen as cruel and wrong, gender distinctions enjoyed a better reputation, at least among powerful men.

""Legislators and judges, in those years, were overwhelmingly white, well-heeled and male,"" Ginsburg said years later, saying they saw gender discrimination as ""operating benignly in women's favor.""

Though she graduated first in her class at Columbia Law School, Ginsburg could not get an interview to be a clerk at the all-male Supreme Court and struggled to even find employment in New York City.

The Supreme Court, led by Chief Justice Earl Warren, had struck down racial segregation in 1954 and ruled the ""equal protection"" clause of the Constitution did not allow legal discrimination by race. But the court's support for civil rights did not extend to women's rights.

In 1961, the Warren court said a ""woman is still regarded as the center of home and family life,"" so women may be excused from serving on juries. The unanimous opinion in Hoyt vs. Florida rejected the claim of an abused woman who had killed her husband with a baseball bat and was convicted by an all-male jury. Gwendolyn Hoyt, the defendant, did not see Florida's law as benign. She believed female jurors would have had a better understanding of her plight.

Ginsburg became a counsel for the American Civil Liberties Union, and by 1972 led its Women's Rights Project. She set out to change the court's view of gender bias and its impact on women and men.

She did not rely on grand pronouncements about inequality or take on hot controversies such as abortion. Instead, she planned a careful, step-by-step approach to undercut sexist laws. She pressed a series of seemingly minor cases -- often on behalf of men -- that demonstrated gender discrimination hurt both men and women.

For example, the Social Security Administration at the time paid a survivor's benefit to a widow after her husband died, but not to a widower whose wife had died. This might have been seen, at first glance, as a gender preference in favor of women. Ginsburg did not think so. When Stephen Wiesenfeld's wife died during childbirth in 1972, he had to raise his son alone, and sued to obtain a survivor's benefit from Social Security.

Ginsburg took the Wiesenfeld case to the Supreme Court and won a unanimous decision in 1975 holding this discrimination against widowers was unconstitutional. It was unfair to the surviving husband, but it was also unfair to the wife who had paid Social Security taxes at the same rate as men, but could not pass on the benefit to her surviving family. And it was unfair to their baby, who needed all the support his widowed father could obtain.

Thanks in part to Ginsburg's efforts, the liberal Warren court that had accepted gender discrimination in the 1960s was succeeded by the supposedly conservative Burger court of the 1970s, which derided as ""archaic"" the notion that gender discrimination was benign.

Ginsburg won five of the six cases she took to the high court in the 1970s, and by the time she left the ACLU to become a judge, she had largely succeeded in establishing the principle that the Constitution prohibited nearly all gender discrimination in law.

In 1980, President Carter named Ginsburg to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia, often described as the nation's second-highest court. A year later, President Reagan named O'Connor, a state appeals judge from Arizona, to be the first woman on the Supreme Court. And 12 years later, Ginsburg joined O'Connor as the second female justice.

Ginsburg was born Ruth Joan Bader on March 15, 1933, in Brooklyn, N.Y., the second daughter of Nathan and Celia Bader. But she grew up as an only child when her older sister died of meningitis. Her mother had a great love of reading and language, and Ruth excelled as a student. But on the day before her high school graduation in 1950, her mother died after a long illness with cervical cancer.

On the day Ginsburg was nominated to the Supreme Court, she brought tears to many eyes at the White House when she paid tribute to her mother. She recalled her as ""the bravest and strongest person I have known, who was taken from me too soon. I pray that I may be all that she would have been had she lived in an age when women could aspire and achieve and daughters are cherished as much as sons.""

A few months after her mother's death, Ginsburg left Brooklyn for Cornell University, where she had won a scholarship and met her future husband, Martin Ginsburg. She enrolled as one of nine women in a Harvard Law class of 500 and was elected to the Harvard Law Review. But she transferred to Columbia after her husband, a Harvard Law graduate and an expert in tax law, joined a New York firm.

She was tied for the honor of top student when she graduated in 1959, but ""not a single law firm in the city of New York bid for my employment,"" she recalled. At the Supreme Court, Justice Felix Frankfurter refused to interview her, saying he was not ready to hire a woman as a law clerk.

Justice William O. Douglas had hired Lucile Lomen as the first female clerk in 1944, but it would be 22 years before a second woman was hired.

Ginsburg clerked for a federal district judge and then began a long teaching career at Rutgers, then Columbia. She had two children: Jane, who also became a Columbia law professor, and James, who became a classical music producer.

Friends often described the Ginsburgs as an ideal, odd couple. He was outgoing, funny and loved to cook. She was shy, scholarly and devoted to the law.

""If you didn't know them but were told one was a tax professor and one was a figure at the Supreme Court, you'd probably guess wrong twice,"" said Alan Morrison, a veteran Washington lawyer.

In public presentations, they joked about their role reversal. ""My wife does not give me any advice about cooking, and I do not give her any advice about the law,"" her husband said.

Ginsburg recalled that when they met as undergraduates at Cornell, ""he was the only guy I ever dated who cared whether I had a brain.""

When he had an early bout with cancer, she helped him get through law school by doing his work as well as hers. And throughout her career, he was her most effective booster.

In the spring of 1993, when Clinton was going back and forth on whom to appoint to the Supreme Court, Martin Ginsburg led a letter-writing campaign to convince the new president that the best option was not a politician like Mario Cuomo or George J. Mitchell, but an experienced federal appeals court judge who had led the fight for gender equality. It worked: Judge Ginsburg got an interview with the president, and Clinton was convinced she was the right choice.

Her husband died in late June 2010, as the court was in its last week of the term. Ginsburg was famous for never missing a day when the court was in session, and the day after her husband's death, she was on the bench to read an opinion. Although she was dry-eyed, Justice Antonin Scalia was in tears.

The friendship between Ginsburg and the outspoken and combative Scalia struck many as surprising, especially for Washington. She was a liberal Democrat. He was a conservative Republican. But they were good friends long before they joined the high court.

They both grew up in New York City in the 1940s and '50s, and became judges on the U.S. Court of Appeals in Washington in the early 1980s. They shared a love of opera and a love of the law. The Ginsburgs also liked to entertain ""Nino"" and Maureen Scalia at their apartment in the Watergate complex.

Ginsburg proudly displayed two photos in her court chambers. In one, she and Scalia are in costume for a guest appearance in an opera. In the other, they are riding atop an elephant in India.

""Her feminist friends"" were upset, Scalia told a college crowd, because ""she rode behind me.""

Undaunted, Ginsburg reported the driver had explained it was ""a matter of distribution of weight."" The audience, Scalia included, roared with laughter.

Their friendship aside, Ginsburg and Scalia took opposite sides in all the major disputes before the court. Scalia, however, did not attack her in print. His opinions often included sharp jabs, even mockery, when he disagreed with other justices, including O'Connor, Anthony M. Kennedy, Stephen G. Breyer and even conservative Chief Justice Chief William H. Rehnquist. But there was never an unkind comment from him directed toward Ginsburg.","{'uri': 'latimes.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'Los Angeles Times'}",[],https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/a58ea33/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1920x1080+0+0/resize/1200x675!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Ff3%2F21%2Fa106464648c8a944d32eb6ff414c%2Fthumbnail%2Fruth-bader-ginsburg-dies.0000000.jpg,,0.3490196078431373,6,6,Los Angeles Times,latimes.com

We generally take it for granted that when you sell your home you will not be charged capital gains tax (CGT). However, it is not always that simple, as a recent legal ruling has made very clear.

In fact, the court case could open the door to a whole load of back claims from homeowners who may have wrongly overpaid CGT.

You only avoid tax completely when you sell a home if you meet the conditions for so-called principal private residence (PPR) relief throughout your period of ownership.

For example, apart from a nine-month overlap period, you are only given relief for one home at a time. However, if you have two homes, you can elect which will qualify for the relief as long as you do so within two years of buying the second home.

The law setting out the rules for claiming PPR relief runs to 11 pages of detailed legislation, supplemented by over 100 pages of guidance in the HMRC manuals.

Few people apart from accountants and lawyers ever look at the legislation because it is so impenetrable.

Instead they rely on various tax guides and, in particular, the HMRC manuals.

I find these manuals very helpful, but it is important to remember that the manuals are not the law - just what HMRC thinks the law is. Ultimately, it is for the courts to decide.

Principal private residence relief has been available ever since the introduction of CGT in 1965. In that time, you might have expected that any anomalies would have been ironed out - but you would be wrong.

What happens, for example, if there is a delay between buying a house and moving into it? The HMRC manuals explain this here. They say that you can claim PPR relief in full, provided you move in within two years of buying the property.

That should cater for most circumstances, but what if the property is in poor condition and needs to be substantially renovated? Perhaps the property needs to be completely demolished?

Alternatively, someone may have bought a building plot with the intention of obtaining planning permission and building a home from scratch. In these circumstances, it could take years before you move into your home.

Until recently, the professional advice would probably have followed the HMRC guidance in that the PPR restriction would apply. However, a recent court decision by the Upper Tribunal says that this guidance is wrong.

Gerald and Sarah Lee bought a plot of land in October 2010. They demolished the existing property and built a new one which they moved into in March 2013.

When they sold the property for a profit, in May 2014, they claimed the full PPR exemption.

HMRC disagreed and said that they were only entitled to relief on a time-apportioned basis when they lived in the property between March 2013 and May 2014 out of the total period of ownership which began in October 2010.

It claimed that CGT was therefore due on a gain of £540,000 (that's a tax bill of around £150,000). The Lees challenged this in court where the key issue was when the ""period of ownership"" commenced.

Was it when the plot was acquired in 2010, as HMRC claimed, or was it only in March 2013 when the house was completed?

In a detailed ruling, the judges decided that the period of ownership only started when the building was completed.

This decision clarifies how the law should be interpreted, not just now but for all previous years. This could mean that many other homeowners will have been told by tax inspectors to pay CGT that we now know was not due.

The normal time limit for making a tax reclaim is four years from the end of the tax year concerned. However, this can be extended by ""extra-statutory concession B41"".

This is where the overpayment of tax has arisen because of an error by the Inland Revenue (pre-2005) or HMRC and the tax man can effectively pay it back even though it is outside of the normal time limits.

A spokesman for HMRC said: ""We are disappointed in this decision, however we will not be submitting an appeal. Information on claiming a tax refund and overpayment relief is online here.

""HMRC will always ensure all relevant considerations, including whether extra-statutory concession B41 applies, are taken into account for any overpayment relief claims made late. Further guidance for individuals can be found here.""

You may wonder why we have evolved such convoluted legislation.

Several years ago, I met the head of the team of lawyers responsible for drafting the Finance Bill. I asked him why they drafted the legislation in such a complicated way that even trained professionals struggled to understand.

His reply was that they did not draft the legislation for tax professionals, let alone the taxpaying public, but for the judges. This was on the basis that it is judges who ultimately have to decide what the rules are.

I suppose there is some obscure logic to this and it certainly helps to explain why we have finished up with the longest tax code in the world, beaten in length only by the Indian railway timetable.

And if you think our politicians have a significant role in this legislative process, think again. Few decisions are actually debated on the floor of the House of Commons. It is the select committees that do this.

A former colleague, who subsequently became an MP, was a member of several Treasury select committees. He told me that on many occasions there would be only two people in the room who really understood the detail of what they were debating; the Treasury minister responsible and the Opposition spokesperson.

Yet more evidence as to why we desperately need an overhaul of the whole structure of UK taxation.

New York CNN --

Manhattan prosecutors urged a judge to reject Donald Trump's motion to dismiss criminal charges related to a hush money payment, saying the former president is trying to use his political power to evade accountability.

Prosecutors also said while investigating the hush money case this year that they gleaned new information from ""campaign insiders"" that support their allegation of Trump's guilt in the hush money payment to adult film star Stormy Daniels and its subsequent cover-up.

Last month, Trump filed a motion to dismiss the indictment on a number of grounds, including alleging it was brought six years after the alleged cover up in an effort to interfere with the 2024 presidential election.

The New York district attorney's office urged Judge Juan Merchan to reject the argument and apply the law equally.

""Defendant repeatedly suggests that because he is a current presidential candidate, the ordinary rules for criminal law and procedure should be applied differently here,"" the district attorney's office wrote. ""This argument is essentially an attempt to evade criminal responsibility because defendant is politically powerful.""

The DA also said that Trump has not lived up to his obligations in providing documents to them as they prepare for trial, which is scheduled for March 2024. Among the issues, prosecutors say, is whether Trump will call any expert witnesses in campaign finance, which was discussed as a potential defense during a pre-indictment meeting earlier this year.

Trump was charged in March with falsifying business records to commit or conceal another crime in what prosecutors allege was a cover up scheme to hide reimbursement payments made to Michael Cohen who paid hush money to Daniels to stop her from going public about a past affair with Trump before the 2016 presidential election. Trump has pleaded not guilty to the 34 charges and denied the affair.

DA says it has testimony from 'campaign insiders'

In the filing Thursday, prosecutors defended their case, writing in a section with multiple redactions that they have testimony from ""campaign insiders"" that back up their allegation that Trump's intent in entering into the hush money and reimbursement scheme was to influence the 2016 presidential election.

""This testimony provided additional powerful evidence of defendant's criminal intent, both at the time he and his confederates executed the election fraud scheme and later when he sought to conceal that criminal scheme by falsifying business records,"" prosecutors wrote.

They noted the grand jury heard testimony that public opinion influences Trump's ""ability to focus on policy priorities,"" in addition to evidence prosecutors said could lead the grand jury to infer that Trump was trying to defraud election regulators. Specific information was redacted from the court filing.

Prosecutors allege the other crimes Trump was allegedly attempting to commit or conceal could include election law, tax laws, or the falsification of other business records.

As for why the charges were brought six years after the payment and reimbursement scheme was made - one of Trump's common arguments against District Attorney Alvin Bragg - prosecutors placed the blame partly on the former president.

""Most important, there were compelling reasons that the People did not bring charges earlier. Defendant wholly ignores the significant obstacles - many imposed by him - that impeded the People's investigation of this matter and reasonably delayed their ability to pursue charges.""

Trump challenged a subpoena for his tax records, which went to the US Supreme Court twice. The court ruled in the district attorney's favor.

DA wants to block Trump's subpoena to Michael Cohen

Bragg's office is also seeking to quash Trump's subpoena to his attorney-turned-foe Michael Cohen.

Trump subpoenaed Cohen for years of communications he has had with investigators and others as well as his tax records and drafts of his books, which have been critical of the former president. Prosecutors argue that Trump is trying to obtain evidence to aid his now-dropped $500 million lawsuit against Cohen for allegedly violating duties while he served as Trump's attorney. Trump has suggested he may refile the lawsuit.

""Defendant's subpoena to Cohen is an extraordinarily broad document demand that exceeds every parameter on the allowable scope of a trial subpoena,"" prosecutors wrote in a separate filing Thursday.

Bragg's office said it has already turned over communications with Cohen, his grand jury testimony and other related materials to Trump's defense attorneys to prepare to defend against the 34-count criminal indictment.","{'uri': 'cnn.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'CNN'}","[{'uri': 'kara_scannell@cnn.com', 'name': 'Kara Scannell', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': False}]","https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/230404165019-trump-bragg-split.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill",eng-9062083,-0.3333333333333334,4,4,CNN,cnn.com

New York CNN --

Donald Trump Jr. returned to the witness stand Monday to give his family's side of the story in the New York attorney general's civil fraud trial against Donald Trump.

Trump Jr.'s testimony often appeared as a lengthy effort to rehabilitate the image of the Trump Organization in the eyes of Judge Arthur Engoron. The former president's son gushed about the properties he said his father had transformed from dilapidated run-down tracts of land into spectacular and magnificent buildings and golf courses.

Trump Jr., a co-defendant in the case, was glowing as he described the company's portfolio - lauding praise on his father as a visionary and a real estate ""artist"" and talking up the value of the buildings after six weeks of testimony from the attorney general alleging that the valuations of the properties were fraudulently inflated.

The testimony signaled how Trump's lawyers plan to mount a defense in a case in which Engoron has already ruled the former president and his co-defendants were liable for fraud. Engoron is now deciding six additional claims and potentially hundreds of millions of dollars in damages.

Here's what to know from Monday's day in court:

Trump Jr. boasts about the Trump Org. portfolio

Trump lawyer Cliff Robert spent most of the day asking Trump Jr. to walk through nearly the entire portfolio of the Trump Org.

Trump Jr. discussed the various projects around the world over the past several decades, narrating a sleekly produced promotional timeline from the company's website. He described various golf holes, clubhouses, architecture and other features of the Trump properties as beauty shots were displayed in the courtroom.

While talking about the Seven Springs resort, a Westchester, New York, property that's part of the attorney general's case, Trump Jr. said the property was ""spectacular"" and a ""potential canvas for [his] father's art.""

Video Ad Feedback Donald Trump Jr says his father is a real estate ""artist"" in civil fraud trial 02:59 - Source: CNN

""He's an artist with real estate. He sees the things that other people don't,"" Trump Jr. said of his father.

The Trump International Golf Club in West Palm Beach, Florida, was swampland before his father took it over. ""No one for decades had seen any value in it,"" Trump Jr. said, and his father turned it into ""one of the finest golf clubs in the world.""

And of the Trump National Doral Golf Club in Florida, Trump Jr. said: ""He saw a jewel in the rough and wanted to bring it back to its former glory.""

At one point, Robert even played the company's promotional video of the Trump Golf Links at Ferry Point in the Bronx, featuring golf legend Jack Nicklaus praising the course.

The Mar-a-Lago valuation fight

While the defense presentation mostly side-stepped the allegations in the case about inflated valuations and financial statements, Robert and Donald Trump Jr. used the walk-through to jab at the attorney general's claims and the judge's ruling against them.

Trump's eldest son said with a smile that he was a bit upset when media reports about this case suggested that Mar-a-Lago was worth only $18 million.

""I may have taken some umbrage,"" he said.

""You couldn't build that atrium for $18 million today,"" he said, referring to a photo shown in court of the room.

Engoron's ruling before the start of the trial cited tax assessor data that appraised the property at $18 million - a figure that has drawn repeated criticism from the former president. Engoron has said he was not valuing the property.

During a brief cross-examination, meanwhile, Assistant Attorney General Colleen Faherty sought to poke holes in Trump Jr.'s rosy assessment of the company. She asked the former president's son about Trump Org.'s 40 Wall Street loan being placed on a servicer's watch list and the occupancy rate of the building being 77%, not the 90% Trump Jr. had claimed it was when he last checked.

Faherty also took shots at the company's Los Angeles golf course, noting that the 18th hole had once fallen into the ocean (though that occurred before the course was rebranded as Trump National Los Angeles). Faherty also asked Trump Jr. about Trump International Hotel Waikiki ditching the Trump name and rebranding.

Trump Jr. responded that the company would receive millions for the name change, so it was no issue to him.

Judge gives Trump's team leeway, with an eye toward the looming appeal fight

The attorney general's office objected to much of the defense presentation Monday, but Engoron offered Trump's attorneys plenty of leeway to make their case, acknowledging out loud the fact that Trump's attorneys are likely to try to reverse the ruling he ultimately makes through an appeal.

When Robert began showing the Trump Org. company history, Assistant Attorney General Kevin Wallace objected, arguing the text descriptions of the properties were coaching the witness and questioning the relevance of the PowerPoint.

But Engoron allowed the presentation. ""Having given you six weeks, you're going to get me in trouble with Mr. (Chris) Kise - he's going to say I always rule against him,"" Engoron said, referring to one of Trump's attorneys. ""No, let this stuff come in.""

""Objection is overruled,"" the judge said. ""Let him go ahead and talk about how great the Trump Organization is.""

At one point, Robert submitted into evidence a February 2022 valuation of Trump's Doral golf resort that valued the property at $1.3 billion, over objections from the attorney general's team.

The attorney general's office argued that the document was not relevant to the case and could not be used later by an expert witness to offer a post-dated valuation of Doral, one of the properties that the attorney general alleges was fraudulently inflated in value on Trump's financial statements. The attorney general's case focuses on Trump's financial statements from 2011-2021.

Engoron, in a sign of his view about how to handle the defense's presentation, asked the lawyers for the attorney general, ""Do you want to risk a reversal over this one stupid document?""

Engoron ultimately overruled the objection, saying it could be admitted on a limited basis, telling Trump's team he's tried to give them ""the benefit of the doubt.""

The judge, nevertheless, noted, ""I can't see any relevance.""

Kise objected to the state lawyer seeking to introduce a document indicating that 40 Wall Street was on a watchlist saying he didn't think it was relevant.

Engoron quipped, ""You're going to start questioning relevance. I just gave you a whole morning of irrelevance.""

Trump Jr. testimony signals direction of Trump's defense

Donald Trump Jr. was the first witness called by Trump's lawyers as they try to make their case to the judge that the defendants didn't do anything intentionally wrong, that Trump's financial statements were not misleading and that different people can come up with different values for the same property.

Sherri Dillon, Trump's longtime tax attorney, was called to the stand Monday afternoon after Trump Jr. finished testifying. It was also her second time appearing in the trial.

""Welcome back, I feel like I'm at a reunion here, the Trump trial reunion,"" Engoron said as she was sworn in.

In addition to Trump Jr., Trump attorneys have said they are likely to call back Eric Trump and the former president, both of whom also previously testified.

Engoron has already ruled that Trump and his co-defendants were liable for fraud, in a summary judgement issued before the trial began. But the attorney general's office is still seeking to prove six additional claims against Trump, including conspiracy, falsifying business records, issuing false financial statements and insurance fraud.

Donald Trump's eldest son was making an encore appearance at the trial, this time as defence lawyers started calling their own witnesses.

Trump Jr first gave evidence two weeks ago, in the last phase of the state's case, which also featured testimony from his father and siblings Eric and Ivanka Trump.

""I'd say it's good to be here, your honour, but I have a feeling that the attorney general would sue me for perjury if I said that,"" he joked before embarking on a detailed history of his father's company.

New York attorney general Letitia James alleges that Donald Trump, his company and executives including his two eldest sons exaggerated his wealth by billions of dollars on financial statements given to banks, insurers and others.

The documents were used to secure loans and make deals. James is seeking more than 300 million dollars (£245 million) in what she says were ill-gotten gains and a ban on defendants doing business in New York.

Trump Jr's evidence on Monday set the tone for a defence case that is expected to last into mid-December.

After a six-week state case that focused heavily on the financial statements, spreadsheets and loan deals at the heart of the case, he tried to humanise the Trump Organisation in the mind of the judge who will decide its fate.

Questioned by his own lawyer, Clifford Robert, he spent more than an hour narrating a slideshow titled The Trump Story, complete with a timeline of the company's evolution and photographs of golf courses, hotels and other major projects.

He spoke glowingly about his father's early years as a Manhattan developer, his work turning eyesores into thriving skyscrapers and the ""vision he had to do things differently"".

""He's an artist with real estate. He sees the things other people don't,"" Trump Jr said, playing up his father's accomplishments while skipping over his failed ventures and casino bankruptcies.

""He has incredible vision that other people don't.""

Trump Jr, a Trump Organisation executive vice president, originally gave evidence during the state's case on November 1 and 2.

He said then that he never worked on the annual financial statements at the heart of James' lawsuit.

He said he relied on the company's longtime finance chief and outside accountants to verify their accuracy.

At times, his evidence on Monday had the feel of a property pitch or an old episode of Lifestyles Of The Rich And Famous.

State lawyer Colleen Faherty tried to forestall the superlative-laced spiel, saying it was ""unfocused to anything relevant"" to the case.

Judge Arthur Engoron disagreed, saying: ""Let this stuff come in. I also find it interesting.""

Before the trial, Judge Engoron ruled that the defendants committed fraud by inflating his net worth and the value of assets on his financial statements.

He imposed a punishment that could strip Donald Trump of properties like Trump Tower, though an appeals court is allowing the former president to remain in control for now.

The Trumps have denied wrongdoing.

Their lawyers contend that the state failed to meet ""any legal standard"" to prove allegations of conspiracy, insurance fraud and falsifying business records.

The state rested its case last Wednesday after six weeks of evidence from more than two dozen witnesses, among them company insiders, accountants, bank officials and Trump's fixer-turned-foe Michael Cohen.

The trial is proceeding after Judge Engoron rebuffed the defence's request last week to end it early through what is known as a directed verdict.

Judge Engoron did not rule on the request, but indicated the trial would move ahead as scheduled.

First up: Donald Trump Jr., who´ll be returning to the witness stand two weeks after state lawyers quizzed him during a major stretch of the trial that also featured testimony from his father and siblings Eric and Ivanka Trump.

Trump´s oldest son, a Trump Organization executive vice president, originally testified on Nov. 1 and 2. He said he never worked on the annual financial statements at the heart of New York Attorney General Letitia James´ lawsuit. He said he relied on the company´s longtime finance chief and outside accounts to verify their accuracy.

James alleges Donald Trump, his company and executives including Eric and Donald Jr. exaggerated his wealth by billions of dollars on financial statements given to banks, insurers and others. The documents were used to secure loans and make deals. She is seeking more than $300 million in what she says were ill-gotten gains and a ban on defendants doing business in New York.

Before the trial, Judge Arthur Engoron ruled that the defendants committed fraud by inflating his net worth and the value of assets on his financial statements. He imposed a punishment that could strip Trump of marquee properties like Trump Tower, though an appeals court is allowing him to remain in control for now.

The Trumps have denied wrongdoing. Their lawyers contend that the state failed to meet ""any legal standard"" to prove allegations of conspiracy, insurance fraud and falsifying business records. The state rested its case last Wednesday after six weeks of testimony from more than two dozen witnesses. Among them: company insiders, accountants, bank officials and Trump´s fixer-turned-foe Michael Cohen.

The trial is proceeding after Engoron rebuffed the defense´s request last week to end it early through what's known as a directed verdict. Engoron did not rule on the request, but indicated the trial would move ahead as scheduled.

Trump lawyer Christopher Kise, seeking a verdict clearing Trump and other defendants, argued last Thursday that the state´s case involved only ""successful and profitable loan transactions"" and that ""there is no victim. There is no complainant. There is no injury.""

On Monday, Trump Jr. will be questioned first by the defense lawyers representing him, his father and other defendants. A state lawyer is also expected to question him on cross-examination. Trump Jr. is expected to testify Monday and Tuesday, followed by a tax lawyer who also testified as a state witness.

The defense also plans to call several expert witnesses as part of their case in an attempt to refute testimony from state witnesses that Trump´s financial statements afforded him better loan terms, insurance premiums and were a factor in dealmaking.

When he became president in 2017, Donald Trump handed day-to-day management of his company to Eric and Donald Trump Jr. and named Trump Jr. as a trustee of a trust he established to hold his assets while in office.

In Donald Trump Jr.´s prior testimony, when asked if he ever worked on his father´s ""statement of financial condition,"" the scion said: ""Not that I recall."" Trump Jr. said he signed off on statements as a trustee, but left the work to outside accountants and the company´s then-finance chief and co-trustee, Allen Weisselberg.

""If they put something forward, I wasn´t working on the document, but if they tell me that it´s accurate, based on their accounting assessment of all of the materials. ...

Derided on the right as drags on the economy and on the left as rubber stamps for business, those in the federal bureaucracy aren't accustomed to tributes. Now, as they aim to build an antitrust movement that would transform the economy, they're on the receiving end of the kind of hero worship on display that summer evening -- especially among law students.

The aspirational speech was typical of the way Khan, who is taking on corporate giants like Amazon and Microsoft, is greeted by campus denizens. And she's not the only one. A few minutes later, the Justice Department's chief antitrust enforcer Jonathan Kanter and his top deputy, Doha Mekki, arrived to glad-hand the students they hope to rally to their cause. Students, advocates, enforcers and congressional staffers exchanged congratulatory ""Happy merger guidelines day"" un-ironically.

The movement that Khan helped build has reached law schools across the country, attracting scores of trustbuster mini-mes. Once sparsely attended antitrust classrooms are bursting at Loyola University Chicago Law School. A quarter of students' submissions to the Georgetown Law Review focused on antitrust last year. And when Kanter filled a 200-person room at Columbia Law School, he stayed so long afterward to shake hands he missed his flight.

There's even merch. At the Anti-Monopoly Summit held this May in Washington, attendees picked up a union-made mug bearing the names of President Joe Biden's antitrust enforcers. Cabinet officials and senators spoke, and the president himself recorded a cheerleading video message for attendees. After years of mainstream indifference, the movement finally has clout.

Whether it's a force with real staying power or a passing fad is yet unknown. But Khan, Kanter and their allies clearly hope that cultivating the next generation can help ground it.

Emma Wallace rattled off the names on the mug -- Wu, Khan and Kanter -- and blurted, ""Oh my God, these are like nerdy superheroes, right?""

A student at Loyola University Chicago Law School, Wallace found herself drawn to the new antitrust revival after reading The Master Switch by Tim Wu, who would go on to become Biden's White House competition czar. As a college student at Fordham University, Wallace said she would walk past the Time Warner buildings during their proposed deal to merge with AT&T and think to herself, ""All that power, all that consolidation.""

When Zaakir Tameez arrived at Yale Law School -- Khan's legal training ground -- he was eager to find a way to channel his frustration with the country's vast inequality. Antitrust was the answer, and Yale, he realized, was an intellectual hotbed of antitrust scholarship.

""Antitrust at Yale is full of brainiacs and bros,"" he explained. ""Brainiacs who are critically undermining the broken assumptions of traditional antitrust theory. And bros who want to see antitrust enforcers flex their muscles and show their guns."" (He didn't say which camp he fell in.)

Khan, who happens to be not much older than many law students, is at least partially responsible for inspiring young people to turn to antitrust. After seeing her at the FTC, it's clear that the DOJ's civil rights division and the EPA aren't the only options for those seeking a vehicle for change.

Khan's rise has been rapid. In 2017, while a student at Yale Law School, Khan authored a paper called ""Amazon's Antitrust Paradox"" that sought to reframe antitrust law and single out the internet's top dog as a monopolistic monstrosity. Khan was well-schooled in the issues, having spent several years as a journalist and researcher at the antimonopoly group, the Open Markets Institute, while being mentored by its leader Barry Lynn, who has long argued for an antitrust revolution.

In a series of events that's now movement lore, Khan's article elevated her profile, opening doors in Congress and leading to a plum academic job at Columbia Law School. She didn't stay long before being tapped to lead the FTC at the age of 32.

The Covid pandemic and its fallout supercharged the push to rethink antitrust policy. Americans saw sudden shortages of critical necessities and a rise in evictions and unemployment. And whenever there's a recession, law schools tend to get more popular. The number of law school applicants jumped nearly 13 percent in 2021, the biggest increase since 2002 when the dot-com bubble burst and sent hordes studying for the LSAT.

With growing interest in antitrust, student demand led more law schools to hire professors solely to teach the subject, several professors said; before then, schools would frequently offer the course every other year or not at all. New chapters of Law and Political Economy Project, a left-leaning academic network that backs the aggressive antitrust agenda, have been sprouting up at law schools across the country. And the federal agencies that handle antitrust policy are eager to match growing student appetite, hiring more recent law school grads and developing relationships on campuses.

Tina LaRitz, a recent graduate of NYU Law School, started an antitrust student group with Sharvari Kothawade, after falling ""in love"" with it during a DOJ summer internship. The government was sure to return the affection: Principal Deputy Assistant Attorney General Doha Mekki spoke at the NYU group's first event.","{'uri': 'politico.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'POLITICO'}",[],https://static.politico.com/f2/56/9a27fe224178827b0e810098c0bf/lina-khan-politico-fty6772.jpg,,0.3176470588235294,108,108,POLITICO,politico.com

In Louisiana Children's Medical Center (LCMC) v. Garland, LCMC acquired three hospitals from HCA Healthcare, Inc. under authority of a Louisiana COPA law. LCMC did not file a Hart-Scott-Rodino (HSR) notification because of the COPA approval. After LCMC and HCA filed lawsuits seeking a declaratory judgment that the transaction was not subject to the HSR Act, the FTC filed suit to enjoin the merger until the hospitals complied with the Act.

The Eastern District of Louisiana granted summary judgment in favor of LCMC, finding that the consummated hospital system merger was immune from federal antitrust scrutiny under the state action doctrine. Under the state action doctrine, when the state acts in its sovereign capacity, its actions, and actions taken by private actors (if certain conditions are met), are immune from liability under the federal antitrust laws. The court found that, under the state action doctrine, the COPA statute exempted the transaction from federal antitrust enforcement and the HSR Act.

In the wake of this decision, counsel should consider whether a health care transaction reviewed or approved under COPA laws in any of the 19 states with such laws is immune from federal antitrust scrutiny. Whether similar immunity will extend under other state laws outside of the COPA context remains to be seen. Determining whether a transaction is HSR-reportable may be particularly important because the FTC has proposed sweeping changes to the HSR Act that would likely significantly increase the burden on filing parties. Counsel should note, however, that health care transactions exempt from HSR reporting may still be subject to reporting under a state premerger notice or notice and approval law.

The US antitrust enforcement agencies continue to aggressively challenge alleged anticompetitive behavior through litigation, including significant recent actions against tech companies.

In September, the FTC, along with attorneys general from 17 states, filed a complaint against Amazon.com alleging that the company is a monopolist and has engaged in anticompetitive activity to maintain that monopoly in violation of the Sherman Act, the FTC Act, and state competition laws. The lawsuit alleges, among other things, that Amazon's anticompetitive actions harm both customers and competitors, including by:

Companies that run any kind of online platform that facilitates exchanges among buyers and sellers, such as a tech platform or financial services platform, should be aware that:

The Amazon enforcement is the third monopolization case the antitrust agencies have brought under Section 2 of the Sherman Act against tech companies in recent years, following the actions against Meta and Google. In the past, these cases have been rare.

(For more on this case, see Key Allegations: FTC and Seventeen States Sue Amazon, Alleging Illegal Maintenance of Monopoly Power on Practical Law; for more on antitrust investigations into US tech companies, see US Tech Antitrust Investigation Tracker on Practical Law.)

Companies should review their arbitration policies in light of a recent decision highlighting the potential costs of mass arbitration.

In Wallrich v. Samsung Electronics America, Inc., nearly 50,000 customers asserted arbitration claims under the American Arbitration Association (AAA) Consumer Arbitration Rules, in accordance with Samsung's customer agreements. The AAA:

Samsung refused to pay the filing fees. Rather than withdraw the claims and litigate the disputes in court, the claimants asked a court to compel Samsung to arbitrate. The court enforced Samsung's own arbitration clause against it and ordered Samsung to pay the filing fees.

Companies generally insert arbitration clauses into their agreements because arbitration is often a streamlined and less expensive alternative to court litigation. However, this calculation changes when a significant amount of claimants assert identical claims and the company is obligated to pay the mass arbitration filing fees under institutional rules. Companies with multiple employees or customers should carefully consider the economics when deciding whether to include arbitration clauses with class action waivers in their employment or customer agreements.

(For more on mass arbitration, see AAA Multi-Case Arbitration: A Step-by-Step Guide and CPR Mass Employment Arbitration on Practical Law.)

Companies should ensure their Section 16 compliance policies and procedures are up to date in light of recent SEC enforcement actions.

In addition to charging several directors and officers with failing to timely report information about their holdings and transactions in company stock, the SEC charged several companies for contributing to their insiders' filing failures and failing to disclose their insiders' filing delinquencies.

These actions serve as a reminder that if companies assume the responsibility for filing Section 16 reports on behalf of their insiders, they must ensure that the filings are completed timely and properly. A company that is negligent in performing these obligations will be liable for their insiders' noncompliance. As a result, companies should review their Section 16 compliance procedures, including:

Additionally, companies should review their internal controls to ensure they capture information regarding any late filings or failures to file by insiders and disclose this information, as required, in their proxy statements.

(For a collection of resources to assist US reporting companies and their directors, executive officers, and 10% stockholders in complying with the requirements of Section 16, see Section 16 Toolkit on Practical Law.)

Reporting companies should be mindful of compliance deadlines for new disclosure rules as they prepare for their next SEC filings.

Areas of focus for disclosure include:

As extreme weather events become an increasingly common occurrence, businesses should take proactive steps to reduce the risk of supply chain disruptions.

Hurricanes, wildfires, and other extreme weather events are devastating communities with alarming frequency. Though these events tend to be localized, their effects can ripple across the supply chain. When an extreme weather event occurs, impacted parties may be able to rely on force majeure clauses to mitigate damages or losses caused by the event.

Businesses should also prepare for extreme weather events by reviewing:

The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) recently issued guidance clarifying adverse action notification requirements under the Equal Credit Opportunity Act (ECOA) and Regulation B for lenders using artificial intelligence (AI) and other complex underwriting models.

AI and other predictive decision-making underwriting models may rely on data collected from consumer surveillance or not usually found in a consumer's application or credit file. However, consumers may not anticipate that this type of data may be a principal reason in a credit decision, particularly if it is not intuitively related to their finances or financial capacity. Where such data factor into the principal reasons for taking adverse action, a lender is required to articulate those reasons with accuracy and specificity.

The ECOA implemented by Regulation B requires that creditors provide applicants with a statement of reasons for taking adverse action, which must be ""specific"" and indicate the ""principal reason(s) for the adverse action."" Although the CFPB provides sample forms that lenders may use, the guidance reiterates that these forms merely provide an illustrative and non-exclusive list.

The guidance notes the importance of specificity when creditors utilize complex algorithms, for example:

The use of emerging enterprise AI tools for businesses is increasing and set to reshape how companies do business. These tools are trained using large data sets, making them capable of outputting generative data.

Striking a balance between the promise of AI technology and the associated legal risks can be challenging, particularly because companies may view enterprise AI tools as less risky than free public AI tools. Companies employing these emerging technologies should nevertheless consider potential risks, including:

Material and labor supply challenges continue to plague the construction industry. While some supply chain disruptions have eased post-pandemic, impacts are still being felt, including in market segments where the Build America, Buy America Act requires domestically sourced products. Labor shortages are persistently posing obstacles to project execution. Economic analysts who track labor demands report a short supply of skilled labor. These factors drive labor costs higher.

Financial services companies, in particular, have been spooked by red-state officials' threats to file antitrust lawsuits over collaborative net-zero commitments they have made through groups such as the Net-Zero Insurance Alliance and the Net-Zero Banking Alliance. But if they were looking for assurances that they're on solid legal footing, it wasn't clearly communicated by a Federal Trade Commission policy official who attempted to outline the federal government's position at an event in Washington last week.

""Just the plain reading of the antitrust laws can take into account social goals like sustainability like racial equity,"" the FTC's Synda Mark told the gathering of corporate and legal officials. ""All of these other social values, I think, are embedded in not only the history, but the actual meaning of the antitrust statutes that we have."" At the same time, Mark said, any discussions between private economic actors on ESG issues must be heavily scrutinized.

Lee Berger, a former senior DOJ official who is now an antitrust lawyer at Steptoe & Johnson, sees Mark's comments as far from reassuring. ""It was platitudes, there was not a lot that was communicated there,"" Berger said. ""If the FTC says it's going to consider equity and sustainability in its antitrust decisions, it has to explain how.""

State attorneys general, meanwhile, appear to be preparing for action, hiring two outside law firms to lead the investigation and potential litigation that, according to a source familiar with internal discussions, could come in the next year.

D.C-based Cooper & Kirk and Arizona-based Fusion Law have been retained by the states, according to a separate person with knowledge of the probes. Fusion Law was also involved in a recently dismissed state AG case challenging ESG rules from the Labor Department.

Doug Peterson, the Republican former Nebraska attorney general who led a 38-page report on ESG issues before leaving office, said in an interview that while he doesn't know where the coalition of GOP AGs currently stands on timing for a lawsuit, he was highly interested in taking legal action.

""Had I stayed in office, I would have had this as one of my top priorities,"" said Peterson, who now works as counsel at the Keating O'Gara law firm in Nebraska. ""AGs are in the unique position to both investigate and prosecute this type of anti-competitive market behavior.""

Such a case could rest on companies joining groups that mobilize their market power toward setting financing and investment goals that fuel fewer emissions, allegedly amounting to a ""boycott"" of fossil fuels.

There would be challenges in successfully arguing such a case: All of the big financial firms still invest heavily in oil and gas, and the net-zero groups are voluntary and non-binding -- amounting to a ""weak"" argument on antitrust grounds, according to a Columbia Center on Sustainable Investment report released this summer.

""It'll be a difficult legal case to make given some of the requirements to prove an antitrust case,"" said Chong Park, a former FTC senior trial attorney and now partner at the Ropes & Gray law firm, who compared these net-zero industry groups to trade associations that warrant antitrust scrutiny but often do not produce actual collusive conduct that harms competition.

The anti-ESG side could soon find itself with a highly placed friend at the FTC itself. Utah Solicitor General Melissa Holyoak, one of two GOP nominees to the agency, played a key role in organizing a May letter from 23 state attorneys general asking members of the Net-Zero Insurance Alliance about their ESG policies, according to information obtained in a public records request. The other GOP nominee to the FTC is Virginia Solicitor General Andrew Ferguson, who helped the Labor Department case alongside Holyoak and the Texas Attorney General's office.

The chilling effect is real, Peggy Otum, a WilmerHale partner, said of her clients at last week's Washington event. Case in point: After the May letter stating that collaboration on emissions reductions targets could violate state and federal antitrust laws, members concerned about legal risks fled the group.

Berger pointed to Europe as a potential model. The European Commission in June issued guidance that ""antitrust rules do not stand in the way of agreements between competitors that pursue a sustainability objective.""

HIGH STAKES -- After highly anticipated trade talks between the U.S. and EU belly flopped last week, a transatlantic rift is throwing green steel talks into disarray -- and further undercutting the narrative of a strong Western economic alliance.

Without a deal to set up a green steel and aluminum club, Trump-era tariffs and EU counter-tariffs will snap back on Jan. 1 -- though Washington vowed not to reimpose tariffs next year if a deal isn't reached. The two sides are also in pursuit of a deal on critical minerals to take some of the pain out of the Inflation Reduction Act's green subsidies.

The nothingburger summit on trade issues is poor PR, Camille Gijs and Sarah Anne Aarup report.

""It looks awkward for both sides -- given what they are saying in terms of liberal democracies working together,"" said Fredrik Erixon, an economist and director of the Brussels-based ECIPE think tank. ""It doesn't look good [if] they cannot find a way to resolve trade frictions they have on a small part of bilateral trade.""

It goes beyond tensions around steel. At the core of the discourse is how to deal with China and shape the global trading system. Plus, the U.S. was displeased not to have received any exemption from the EU's carbon border tax, which will impose a levy on steel and aluminum imports that are made with more carbon than Europe's own production.

BLEAK OUTLOOK -- The world is unlikely to meet mid-century targets for limiting global warming even though fossil fuel consumption will peak before 2030, the International Energy Agency said in its annual outlook report released today.

The report offers only a sliver of hope for keeping temperatures below the threshold of 1.5 degrees C above pre-industrial levels, Zack Colman reports.

Meeting the goal would require halting all new fossil fuel infrastructure, but projects are still moving forward, IEA said. The report noted that spending on oil and gas is two times greater than it should be if nations want to stay on track for net-zero emissions.

Clean energy would have to be deployed rapidly to keep pace with increased power demand resulting from expected world population growth of 1.7 billion people by 2050.

But the IEA did note some bright spots, including slowed growth in gas; reduced emissions in China, the world's largest polluter; increases in global clean energy investments and solar manufacturing; and policies that promote electric vehicles, heat pumps and nuclear power.

A three-judge panel of the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals unanimously upheld Alabama-based U.S. District Judge R. David Proctor's August 2022 approval of the settlement, which followed nearly a decade of litigation involving allegations from individual policyholders, businesses and others.

The appeals court's order on Wednesday spurned challenges to the insurance subscribers' deal from Home Depot and others. One objector fought the $667 million in legal fees and expenses that are part of the settlement.

Writing for the panel, Chief Circuit Judge William Pryor said Home Depot had not persuaded the court that the settlement would harm the power of antitrust enforcers or others to bring claims against Blue Cross Blue Shield in the future.

""The release in this appeal is limited and affects the rights of only some private individuals to sue Blue Cross, and it does not affect public enforcement of the antitrust laws,"" Pryor wrote.

The panel said Home Depot's concerns were ""overstated.""

Home Depot and a lawyer for the company did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

An attorney for the class, David Boies of law firm Boies Schiller Flexner, in a statement called the settlement ""historic"" and welcomed its approval by the Atlanta-based 11th Circuit.

""Consumers across the country will now benefit from the increased health care insurance competition, and substantial monetary award, that this settlement provides,"" Boies said.

Boies argued part of the case at the 11th Circuit last month with Charles Cooper of Cooper & Kirk, who also praised the decision.

Blue Cross Blue Shield Association, which backed the deal, in a statement said it looked ""forward to putting the litigation behind us, once the appeals process is complete.""

Policyholders accused the association and member plans of agreeing not to compete with each other, in violation of U.S. antitrust law. The first complaint was filed in 2012.

In a filing, the plaintiffs' lawyers, led by firms including Boies Schiller and Hausfeld, said the settlement was ""one of the largest monetary recoveries ever achieved in a private antitrust class action.""

The settlement calls for legal fees and expenses of $667 million, or 25% of the settlement fund.

The lawyers' fees ""fell within the range of reasonableness,"" the 11th Circuit panel said.

The deal does not resolve claims from individual companies that opted out of the class action to pursue separate civil lawsuits. Health providers including hospitals and doctors also have pending claims.

The settlement objectors can still ask the appeals court to reconsider or appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court.

The case is In Re: Blue Cross Blue Shield Antitrust Litigation, 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. No. 22-13051.

Epic hopes to convince jurors that Google's app store policies have hurt quality and innovation among app developers and distributors and caused consumers to pay artificially higher prices.

Google planned to present counterclaims that Epic has violated its contract with Google. The trial is expected to last at least four weeks.

The companies declined to comment. Epic largely lost a non-jury trial against Apple (AAPL.O) over its App Store in 2021, but both sides have asked the U.S. Supreme Court to take up the court's ruling.

Google is separately fighting U.S. government antitrust claims over its search dominance at a trial in Washington, D.C., and it is preparing as early as next year to defend its digital ads policies at yet another trial.

Cary, North Carolina-founded Epic introduced its hugely popular multiplayer shooter game ""Fortnite"" in 2017. It is seeking an injunction that could force Google to open up the distribution of apps to Android users beyond the Play Store and also provide consumers greater options for processing payments within Android apps.

""As a result of its anticompetitive acts, Google faces no meaningful competition or threat of competition,"" Epic's lawyers said in a court filing. The lawsuit does not seek monetary damages.

Google has denied Epic's claims and argued that the lawsuit is ""based on the fiction that Google does not compete against Apple.""

The same federal jury will hear counterclaims from Google accusing Epic of breaching contractual obligations by introducing additional payment methods in Fortnite on Android and Apple devices.

""Epic's deceitful conduct unjustly enriched Epic at Google's expense,"" Google said in a filing.

In the lead-up to trial, Google settled similar claims from dating app maker Match Group (MTCH.O), which sought monetary damages in addition to an injunction.

Google also settled antitrust claims over its Play Store from U.S. states and U.S. consumers, but the terms of that deal have not been disclosed publicly.

The case is Epic Games v. Google, U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California, No. 3:20-cv-05671.

For Epic: Christine Varney and Gary Bornstein of Cravath, Swaine & Moore; Paul Riehle of Faegre Drinker Biddle & Reath; and Douglas Dixon of Hueston Hennigan

Universities in England risk breaking competition laws if they add loopholes letting them withdraw offers from students at the last minute if courses are oversubscribed, ministers and regulators have told vice-chancellors.

For the last two years, the surge in A-level grades allowed more students than forecast to meet their offer targets, and some universities withdrew offers when it became clear that courses would be oversubscribed.

In a concerted push by the government, the Office for Students (OfS), the higher education regulator for England and the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA), universities have been told to remove the oversubscription clauses from their offers or face possible punishments from the regulators.

Michelle Donelan, the universities minister, told vice-chancellors that it was ""vital"" that their offers were fair as an incentive for hardworking students to attain their grades.

""It is therefore disappointing that, during previous admissions cycles, there have been instances of providers introducing oversubscription conditions that permitted them to withdraw places where the number of students meeting offer conditions exceeded the number of places,"" Donelan said in a letter sent to all vice-chancellors in England.

The OfS said it was ""concerned"" that higher education institutions had added the oversubscription clauses to their contracts with students.

""Our view is that providers should not use such clauses, as doing so would probably contravene consumer law,"" the OfS stated. ""A potential breach in consumer law may prompt the OfS to investigate and, if appropriate, carry out enforcement action to address any failures to comply.""

The CMA, which regulates universities for possible breaches of competition law, reiterated its view that the offer and acceptance of a university place was effectively a legally binding contract, with the university obliged to reserve a place providing the student met specific entry requirements such as A-level grades.

A clause allowing wide discretion to cancel an accepted offer ""is likely to be unfair under 'unfair terms' legislation"", the CMA said. Similar clauses that would limit the liability of a university if it fails to provide qualified students with a place ""are inappropriate and potentially unfair"".

Universities UK, which represents the leadership of major institutions, said decisions on admissions were a key area of university autonomy, and that institutions were ""well aware of their legal obligations under consumer law and strive to ensure these are met"".

University leaders say they have been forced to withdraw places or offer incentives for students to change courses or delay their study because of the uncertainty created by the pandemic, especially the government's decision to cancel formal exams and use teacher-assessed grades instead. That led to a much higher number of top grades awarded than admissions offices had forecast.

Donelan also welcomed efforts by Universities UK and GuildHE to draw up a new sector-wide code of practice for admissions. But she also urged universities to reject the use of ""conditional-unconditional"" offers, which give students a guaranteed place in return for immediately rejecting all their other choices.

During the pandemic, the OfS placed a temporary ban on the use of these offers, which expired in September. Donelan said she would ""strongly encourage"" universities to continue ""avoiding the use of conditional-unconditional offers and other practices which may place undue pressure on students to make choices"".","{'uri': 'theguardian.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","[{'uri': 'say_ministers@theguardian.com', 'name': 'Say Ministers', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': False}]",https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/61604899df82d6a089d3da80df7db958b6db7da3/0_13_3500_2099/master/3500.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&s=bcc978c08cdd32d1ef38aa991d3259ff,,0.03529411764705892,82,82,The Guardian,theguardian.com

County D.A. who oversaw McMartin Preschool case, dies at 83","Robert Philibosian, the former Los Angeles County district attorney who oversaw the prosecution in the controversial McMartin Preschool case and later served as legal commentator in another high-profile trial, the criminal case against O.J. Simpson, has died at the age of 83, according to his family.

Philibosian, who served as the county's 38th district attorney from 1982 to 1984, was battling West Nile encephalitis and fell into a coma, daughter Janet Philibosian Valenzuela said. He was removed from life support on Monday.

Family members said in a statement:

""He was a true public servant and always put others before himself. He helped countless people advance their careers with no expectation of anything in return. He cherished his family (including his entire large extended family) above all else and devoted his life to his wife, his children and our spouses, and his beloved grandchildren. He took such pride in all of our accomplishments and we can't imagine our lives without his constant presence.""

In 1982, Philibosian was unanimously chosen by the Board of Supervisors to succeed Dist. Atty. John Van de Kamp following Van de Kamp's election to state attorney general. The Times reported at the time that the board decision came ""after a series of roll calls marked by high drama and intense lobbying.""

Philibosian won out over two highly touted candidates, U.S. Atty. Stephen Trott and former Republican Assemblyman Dave Stirling. Lobbying to the board on his behalf was political ally and California Gov.-elect George Deukmejian. After three split roll calls, Supervisor Kenneth Hahn changed his mind and provided Philibosian the vote he needed.

Board members denied they were swayed by Philibosian's close ties to the governor and pointed to his 15 years of experience as a prosecutor.

Upon accepting the board's appointment, Philibosian pledged ""all my efforts toward making the district attorney's office as effective as possible.""

During his time as district attorney, Philibosian prosecuted civil cases regarding toxic waste disposal and environmental, consumer and antitrust law, as well as criminal matters. But perhaps the case that drew the most headlines was the prosecution of staff members at McMartin Preschool in Manhattan Beach who were accused of child molestation.

Peggy McMartin Buckey, her son, Ray Buckey, and her mother, Virginia McMartin, were among seven at the preschool initially indicted on 115 counts of child molestation by Philibosian, the presiding district attorney during the infamous case.

Ultimately, the case resulted in no convictions. All charges were dropped by 1990, with the entire case lasting seven years and costing taxpayers more than $13 million, making it the longest and most expensive trial in American history.

The Times reported that some jurors in the trials involving the Buckeys ""said the children appeared to have been led by questioners to claim they had been molested. Others said that so much time had passed that the memories of the children -- who passed from toddlerhood to adolescence in the course of the legal proceedings -- couldn't be trusted.""

Mary Ann Jackson was one of the preschool employees and original defendants against whom charges were dismissed. She told The Times that she blamed the hysteria and political ambitions of Philibosian, who was in a reelection bid, for a ""weak case.""

He would lose his reelection race to Ira Reiner in 1984.

Philibosian joined the Los Angeles County district attorney's office in 1968, rising to become head deputy in charge of the Van Nuys branch in 1979.

Deukmejian, then the attorney general, appointed him as chief assistant attorney general of the criminal law division, where he served from 1979 until 1982. In this position, he directed the state's criminal appellate prosecution and oversaw initiatives against consumer fraud and antitrust issues.

""Robert Philibosian was an iconic figure in California's legal and political scene, leaving an indelible mark on the legal community and beyond,"" the Association of Deputy District Attorneys said in a statement. ""His unwavering commitment to service, his dedication to mentorship, and his steadfast love for his family defined his illustrious career and life.""

At the height of the media frenzy surrounding the O.J. Simpson trial, Philibosian served as a legal commentator for ABC News, becoming a highly visible media figure throughout the trial. He appeared regularly on ""Nightline,"" ""World News Tonight,"" ""20/20"" and ""Good Morning America,"" heading up ABC's coverage of special events during the trial, including closing arguments and the verdicts.

Sheppard Mullin -- where he was a partner and legal counsel, working there from 1994 until his death -- released a statement saying Philibosian had made ""a lasting impression on the legal and political community, and his tireless commitment to advocating for justice stays with all of us.""

""He was a brilliant attorney, a keen strategist and a consummate professional,"" the statement said. ""To know Bob was to know him as a friend and a mentor, with generosity felt by all. His advice was treasured, whether he was advising clients on legal matters or providing words of wisdom to colleagues at the firm.""

Philibosian was born in Selma, Calif., on Sept. 29, 1940.

He earned a bachelor's degree in history from Stanford University and, in 1967, a law degree from Southwestern Law School. He passed the California State Bar in 1968.

""Everybody who came in contact with him respected him. Whether it was the client or the adversary, Republican or Democrat, everybody respected,"" said Guy Halgren, who was partners with Philibosian at Sheppard Mullin.

Philibosian is survived by his wife of 54 years, Nancy Philibosian; children Janet Philibosian Valenzuela and Robert Philibosian; five grandchildren; and siblings Dianne Philibosian and Richard Philibosian.","{'uri': 'latimes.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'Los Angeles Times'}",[],https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/935abd8/2147483647/strip/true/crop/453x255+0+40/resize/1200x675!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F49%2Fc5%2Fb527b9434c0993d79f4d228264e7%2Fla-me-robert-philibosian.jpg,eng-9063832,0.05882352941176472,76,76,Los Angeles Times,latimes.com

Austin-Texas based Keller Williams, which markets itself as the largest real estate franchise by number of agents, in a statement on Wednesday said Clement was ""well-matched for this high-stakes appeals process.""

Clement, a former George W. Bush-era U.S. solicitor general, has argued more than 100 cases at the U.S. Supreme Court. He will join other veteran appellate lawyers who are jumping into the blockbuster case after home sellers prevailed at trial last month in Kansas City, Missouri, federal court.

The National Association of Realtors, a defendant in the case and whose commission rules were at issue, said it had brought on Gregory Garre of Latham & Watkins for its post-trial legal team. Garre also is a former U.S. solicitor.

Real estate brokerage HomeServices of America, owned by Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway (BRKa.N), has hired Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher's Theodore Boutrous.

In the underlying case, a jury on Oct. 31 said home sellers had paid inflated commissions to real estate brokers representing home buyers. The verdict will be automatically tripled to more than $5 billion under U.S. antitrust law.

Keller Williams, HomeServices and the realtors' association have said they will appeal to the St. Louis-based 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals.

In a statement, Clement said on Wednesday that ""the verdict here raises serious legal issues.""

Clement, previously at law firm Kirkland & Ellis, opened a small, appellate-focused law office last year.

He said he left Kirkland over its stance that it would not represent clients any further on 2nd Amendment firearms matters. Clement has long advocated in court for gun rights and other conservative social causes.

NEW YORK, Nov 1 (Reuters) - Shares of Douglas Elliman , Compass and eXp World Holdings closed lower on Wednesday after the companies were sued for allegedly conspiring to artificially inflate their commissions from home sales.

The proposed class action was filed on Tuesday in Kansas City, Missouri, just hours after a jury there found the National Association of Realtors and other brokerages, including Berkshire Hathaway's HomeServices of America, liable to pay $1.78 billion in damages for similar commission practices.

Damages in that first case could be tripled under federal antitrust law to more than $5.3 billion.

The verdict could upend decades-old practices that have allowed real estate agents to boost commissions by forcing sellers to pay commissions to buyers' real estate brokers. Home sellers complained that this model suppressed competition.

Shares of the new defendants fell between 0.3% and 7.3% on Wednesday. Redfin, also a defendant in the lawsuit, rebounded from earlier losses and finished up 0.7%.

Both lawsuits were filed in the U.S. District Court in Western Missouri by the same lawyer. The first action was brought on behalf of sellers of more than 260,000 homes in Missouri, Kansas and Illinois between 2015 and 2022. Tuesday's lawsuit is on behalf of sellers nationwide.

A spokesperson for eXp said the company was still studying the complaint, adding: ""We are committed to upholding fair and transparent practices compliant with law and we already have mechanisms and a plan in place that enables buyers and sellers to negotiate commissions.""

Representatives of Compass and Douglas Elliman declined to comment. A Redfin spokesperson declined to comment, referring questions to a previously published statement by CEO Glenn Kelman saying that the lawsuit will ""ensure major change"" to the industry given the size of the award even though ""years of appeal"" lay ahead.

BTIG analyst Soham Bhonsle in an investor note said the fact that Douglas Elliman, Redfin, Compass and eXp were being sued by the same lawyers was a negative for their stocks.

Shares of Re/Max and Anywhere Real Estate, two other brokerages that had initially been defendants in the first lawsuit but settled prior to trial, finished up 5.4% and down 3.9%, respectively, on Wednesday. Both had fallen on Tuesday despite their earlier settlements.

Zillow shares initially fell 0.33% after brokerage Jefferies cut its price target, citing the impact of Tuesday's verdict. Zillow stock ended 0.7% higher on Wednesday following a 7% drop the previous day. While Zillow is not a defendant in either lawsuit, Jefferies said Tuesday's verdict ""increases the chances of a ban on commission sharing and Zillow having to pivot the business model."" Zillow did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

On Tuesday, representatives of NAR and HomeServices said they planned to appeal.

Shein had accused Temu of unfair business practices, while Temu alleged that Shein bullied suppliers and violated antitrust rules

Fierce rivals Shein and PDD Holdings-owned Temu have applied to end their legal fights with each other in the US, documents show, marking a truce even as a global market share battle between the low-price online platforms heats up.

Joint declarations were filed to courts in Chicago and Boston by lawyers representing the companies and their subsidiaries, requesting that two legal cases be dismissed “without prejudice” by their judges.

The filings did not contain details on why they had decided to drop their complaints or whether any settlement had been made. Neither firm immediately responded to a request for comment on the filings on Friday.

Shein’s lawsuit against Temu, filed last December in the US District Court for the Northern District of Illinois, alleged that Temu told social media influencers to make disparaging remarks about the fast-fashion retailer, and tricked customers into downloading the Temu app using “impostor” social media accounts.How Shein and Temu are changing the face of China’s vast export machine

In July, Temu filed its own lawsuit in Boston federal court, accusing Shein of violating US antitrust law in its dealings with clothing manufacturers.

Temu’s complaint alleged Shein “forces manufacturers to sign loyalty oaths certifying that they will not do business with Temu”.

In previous statements, both firms denied any wrongdoing in the cases.

The two companies have shaken up the global retailing landscape with an ultra-fast fashion, low-price shopping model.

Shein, founded in China, and valued at US$66 billion, sells fast fashion at rock bottom prices, including dresses priced at US$10 and bike shorts for around US$5. The company produces clothing, mainly in China, that is sold online in the US, Europe and Asia.

Temu, whose parent company PDD Holdings also owns Chinese shopping platform Pinduoduo, similarly sells low-priced clothing but is equally well known for stocking cheap headphones and home appliances.

According to a note from HSBC analysts published this week, Temu is targeting US$16 billion in gross merchandising volume in 2023, versus consensus estimates of US$11 billion.","{'uri': 'scmp.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'South China Morning Post'}",[],https://cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/d8/images/canvas/2023/10/27/2e5388a7-0013-450f-ac1b-1cd303257946_cfe83f8d.jpg?itok=KFZiUdhs,eng-9008814,-0.3254901960784313,76,76,South China Morning Post,scmp.com

Demand increased 1.5% year-over-year, with bankruptcy, labor and employment, litigation and antitrust among practices that helped drive growth, according to the latest edition of the Thomson Reuters Institute's Law Firm Financial Index, which was released on Monday.

The index, which tracks key financial metrics across 170 large and midsized law firms, jumped 6 points in the second quarter of 2023 to the highest score since the first quarter of 2022.

Averaged worked rates - the rate a client has agreed to pay to engage a firm on a legal matter - grew by 5.9% in the second quarter of 2023 compared to the same period the prior year, the report said.

The new figures contrast with Q2 2022, when there was ""dramatic impact"" from a decline in law firm transactional practices, said William Josten, manager for enterprise legal content at the Thomson Reuters Institute, which shares the same parent company as Reuters.

In Q2 2023, ""we're seeing that the counter-cyclical practices have now started to pick up and start to pick up some of the softening"" in the market for transactional work, Josten said.

Demand grew 5.7% for bankruptcy work, 4.6% for antitrust and regulatory work, and 2.4% for labor and employment work in the second quarter. Litigation work climbed 4%, which Josten said could also be a result of courts clearing pandemic-era backlogs.

Demand for corporate practice areas grouped together grew 0.1%, while mergers and acquisitions demand fell 6%. Real estate demand fell 8.4%.

Midsize and large law firms are using different tactics to strengthen profitability, the report said.

Looking to increase revenue, midsize firms grew their associate head count by 0.6% between January and June 2023.

The top 100 law firms, tracked by the American Lawyer and based on revenue, trimmed their associate ranks by 2.5% during that period. Firms that rank between 101-200 grew associate headcount by 0.4%.

A growing number of large U.S. law firms have laid off modest numbers of lawyers and staff as they navigated a downturn in demand late last year and into this year. Two more firms announced cuts this week.

The layoffs indicate ""that firms are trying to find that balance and that right structure of their talent,"" Josten said, noting that the legal industry is not conducting mass layoffs as it did in the 2008 financial crisis.","{'uri': 'reuters.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'Reuters'}","[{'uri': 'sara_merken@reuters.com', 'name': 'Sara Merken', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': False}]",https://www.reuters.com/resizer/CHX3yOvgo2vV3CSQpOnfWBvkgEM=/728x381/smart/filters:quality(80)/cloudfront-us-east-2.images.arcpublishing.com/reuters/3UGYEWDR3ZNG3PT62SF53DYACM.jpg,,0.192156862745098,59,59,Reuters,reuters.com

The U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit issued a stinging rebuke of Jackson for ""deliberate, repeated, egregious and flagrant"" violations of judicial ethics for remarks he made to journalists throughout the landmark antitrust trial.

""This was an astonishing blunder by a trial judge,"" said Northwestern University law professor Stephen Lubet, an expert on judicial behavior. ""No other judge has ever had such extensive contact with journalists while presiding over a case and it is likely no one will ever do it again.""

The 7-0 opinion characterizes Jackson, 64, as a jurist ""posturing for posterity."" The ruling is laced with detailed references to comments the judge made to reporters forecasting his rulings.

The appellate judges said that Jackson's practice of forbidding journalists to use the information until he ruled made the situation even worse because it gave Microsoft no chance to respond.

""Concealment of the interviews suggests knowledge of their impropriety,"" the appeals court said.

Jackson agreed to interviews with several journalists, including New Yorker writer Ken Auletta, who wrote a book about the case. While the trial was pending, Jackson told reporters he thought Microsoft Chairman Bill Gates ""has a Napoleonic concept of himself and his company."" He chastised Gates for delivering testimony that was ""inherently without credibility.""

Jackson, who was appointed to the federal bench by President Reagan in 1982, compared Microsoft's protest of innocence to the attitudes of gang members in a racketeering case he presided over. Just a month before he issued his order calling for the break up of Microsoft, Jackson told reporters that judges on the appellate court that would review the case are ""supercilious,"" lacking in practical trial experience and utilizing ""superficial scholarship.""

In Thursday's ruling, the court of appeals acknowledged that it had found ""no evidence of actual bias"" by Jackson.

However, the appeals court ruled that Jackson's actions had ""seriously tainted the proceedings . . . and called into question the integrity of the judicial process. The public cannot be expected to maintain confidence in the integrity and impartiality of the federal judiciary in the face of such conduct.""

The court lamented that Jackson had failed to heed the cautionary words of Judge Learned Hand, who wrote in 1953 of ""this America of ours where the passion for publicity is a disease, and where swarms of foolish, tawdry moths dash with rapture into its consuming fire.""

More specifically, the appellate court said that Jackson had violated three critical ethical precepts embodied in the Code of Conduct for United States Judges: Refrain from comment on the merits of pending cases; ""avoid impropriety and the appearance of impropriety in all activities,"" and do not initiate or consider out-of-court communications on the merits of pending cases.

Additionally, the U.S. Judicial Code provides that judges must recuse themselves when their ""impartiality might reasonably be questioned."" The appellate court said that Jackson's conduct certainly crossed that line.

USC law professor Erwin Chemerinsky applauded the ruling, saying the appellate court had followed both the letter of a federal law governing such situations and prior precedents. Chemerinsky said it is rare but not unprecedented for a federal judge to be taken off a case because of comments to the media.

New York University law professor Eleanor Fox said the appeals court's comments on Jackson were ""harsh but necessary,"" because his statements to reporters were ""integral to the case.""

As a trial judge, Jackson has had a reputation for becoming an expert on issues that his cases revolved around. During the Microsoft trial, he was seen lugging home thick binders on the weekends. At one point, with the help of an aide, he showed that Microsoft's Internet Explorer Web browser could be removed from the Windows operating system--a key point in the case.

This hardly was the first high profile case handled by Jackson. In 1988, he fined former Reagan aide Michael Deaver $100,000 for lying about his lobbying activities. In 1990, he sentenced Washington Mayor Marion S. Barry Jr. to six months in prison for cocaine possession. In 1994, he ordered Sen. Bob Packwood (R-Ore.) to surrender salacious diaries whose details drove him from office.

Experts said it is unclear whether the appellate court would formally reprimand Jackson. The judge has lifetime tenure and can be removed only by impeachment for ""high crimes and misdemeanors.""

'I think he [Microsoft Chairman Bill Gates] has a Napoleonic concept of himself and his company, an arrogance that derives from power and unalloyed success, with no leavening hard experience, no reverses.'

'It's procedurally unusual to do what Microsoft is proposing--are you aware of very many cases in which the defendant can argue with the jury about what an appropriate sanction should be? Were the Japanese allowed to propose the terms of their surrender? The government won the case.'

'They [Microsoft's executives] don't act like grownups. . . To this day they continue to deny they did anything wrong.]'

""I am not aware of any case authority that says I have to give them any due process at all. The case is over. They lost. .. I'm suspicious that they are just playing for time, hoping they will get to deal with a new administration.""

Law firms Susman Godfrey and Hausfeld on Friday submitted their request for fees to U.S. District Judge Naomi Reice Buchwald, who is presiding over claims in Manhattan federal court that a group of banks conspired to manipulate the Libor benchmark interest rate, including during the financial crisis.

The fee award would add to others worth more than $100 million for the two firms so far.

Hausfeld and Susman Godfrey represented a class of ""over the counter"" (OTC) investors that transacted directly with the bank defendants in the Libor litigation, which began in 2011.

In the most recent settlement, the sixth overall, Dutch cooperative bank Rabobank, Lloyds Banking Group (LLOY.L) and other banks agreed to pay $101 million to resolve claims against them.

The fee request amounts to 25% of the new settlement. The firms indicated they would seek up to 30% later in the litigation.

Representatives from Rabobank and Lloyds on Monday did not immediately respond to requests for comment. The banks had disputed the plaintiffs' claims and denied liability.

Susman Godfrey's William Carmody and Michael Hausfeld of Hausfeld had no immediate comment.

Libor, or the London Interbank Offered Rate, has been used as a reference to set interest rates on items including mortgages, credit cards and student loans. The plaintiffs claimed the defendant banks artificially lowered the rate, reducing payments to individuals and institutions that are part of the class.

Among other defendants, Deutsche Bank (DBKGn.DE) paid $240 million in a prior settlement, and Citibank agreed to pay $130 million.

In their fee filing, the class attorneys said they have spent 124,422 hours on the litigation through July.

Carmody, who heads Susman Godfrey's New York office and is a member of the firm's executive committee, is billing at $2,200 an hour, the filing showed. Michael Hausfeld's rate was listed at $1,550 an hour.

A court hearing to determine the fairness of the latest settlement is scheduled for Dec. 12.

The case is In re: Libor-Based Financial Instruments Antitrust Litigation, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York, No. 11-md-02262.

DePape is charged with bludgeoning the former House speaker's husband, Paul Pelosi, with a hammer and plotting to kidnap her in an October 2022 attack.

DePape's attorneys and federal prosecutors are expected to interview jurors as each side looks to pick a jury of 12 people that will decide his fate.

The venue has already led to a debate about the jury's ability to be impartial. The trial is slated to play out two miles from Pelosi's Pacific Heights mansion where the attack occurred, in a courthouse named for the late U.S. Rep. Philip Burton, Pelosi's mentor and predecessor.

""Nancy Pelosi is a loved and revered public servant in San Francisco,"" noted Valery Nechay, a local criminal trial attorney who is following the case. ""Political ideology will definitely be examined (in jury selection).""

DePape's attorneys tried to move the case to Eureka, a small city nearly 300 miles north of San Francisco. They argue that pervasive media attention, as well Pelosi's popularity in San Francisco -- she was reelected with 84 percent of the vote in 2022 -- could skew the jury against DePape.

DePape has pleaded not guilty and could face decades in prison if convicted. Complaints about jury impartiality in San Francisco will likely be an element in any appeal if he's convicted.

U.S.District Court Judge Jacqueline Scott Corley rejected the venue change request this past summer. Corley said that Eureka residents were likely also exposed to coverage of a ""notorious national case"" and suggested a smaller pool of potential jurors to pull from in Eureka could make it harder to find an even-handed group.

Jury selection interviews will provide the defense with another opening to make the argument -- particularly after potential jurors are questioned about their feelings on Pelosi.

But even if jurors have voted for Pelosi or support her politically, that likely won't be enough to disqualify them. Laurie Levenson, a former federal prosecutor and criminal law professor at Loyola Law School in Los Angeles, said the crucial factor is whether jurors swear to keep an open mind.

""The legal standard is whether you can be fair in the proceedings,"" Levenson said.

GOOD MORNING. Happy Monday. Thanks for waking up with Playbook.

PLAYBOOK TIP LINE -- What other California court cases are on your radar? Give us a ring or drop us a line.

BRIDGING THE DIVIDE -- The nation's top antitrust and consumer protection official made a swing through Silicon Valley last week to meet with leaders in Big Tech and make the case that federal regulation is critical for the future of the industry -- especially as artificial intelligence continues to evolve at a breakneck speed.

At 32, Lina Khan became the youngest person to ever head the Federal Trade Commission when President Joe Biden appointed her in 2021. She is considered to be the leader of a new school of antitrust thought, taking an aggressive bent to go after corporate monopolies, especially in tech. Prior to her appointment, she issued scathing criticisms of Amazon and Facebook, and has since overseen a slate of strategic lawsuits and investigations aimed at Microsoft, Meta, Facebook's parent company, and X, formerly known as Twitter.

It's no surprise, then, that the tech world showed a little trepidation at her arrival.

""After we announced that you were coming to YC, I received a number of DMs from friends in tech who say, 'Don't you know that she sues tech?'"" said Garry Tan, CEO of startup accelerator Y Combinator, during a fireside chat with Khan in San Francisco on Friday. ""... 'Isn't she an enemy of tech?'""

Khan's visit was part of an effort to get out of Washington and talk to people in the industry, she said. Her argument, as articulated in her talk with Y Combinator employees, is that the big tech companies grew out of -- and thrived on -- fierce competition, but have since made it nearly impossible for competitors to take root.

""Enforcing the laws of fair competition is actually really critical to make sure that the market stays open and stays competitive and that the next tier of innovators are able to come to the market in scale, and become tomorrow's giants rather than get kind of killed in the crib by existing incumbents,"" Khan told YC employees.

The tour of Silicon Valley came just days after Biden signed a sweeping executive order on AI, which was criticized by Tan and many of his tech peers who argue it could stifle innovation.

Khan said the dawn of AI represents a ""technological inflection point,"" which can be helpful in opening the market and allowing competition to flourish -- but that the FTC is already seeing concerns that critical parts of the technology are controlled by only a handful of companies.

""We may already be seeing bottlenecks in ways that could impede innovation and impede competition,"" she said.

NOT ANOTHER DUI -- A high-profile race for Los Angeles City Council could be upended after Assemblymember Wendy Carrillo was arrested early Friday on suspicion of drunk driving.

She is among a pack of Democrats aiming to unseat Council member Kevin de León, who is mounting an uphill reelection bid after a racist leaked audio scandal last year made him a political pariah. Assemblymember Miguel Santiago is also running for the seat -- and the race has divided the Assembly Democratic Caucus.

Carrillo's legal troubles could create significant headwinds for her campaign. She apologized to constituents and vowed to ""seek the necessary help and support."" Her arrest marks the second time in recent months that a state lawmaker has received a DUI (State Sen. Dave Min was cited in May and pleaded no contest).

CRIME FIGHTERS -- A lot of lawmakers talk about taking on retail theft, but few are doing it quite like Assemblymember Tim Grayson.

Grayson and his son physically stopped and detained two people suspected of trying to steal $18,000 worth of merchandise from a Petaluma Sunglass Hut in late September, an adviser for his campaign confirmed to Playbook. According to the police report, two Antioch women had pushed past the store's security guard and were attempting to flee with the goods when they ran into the lawmaker and his adult son. Each took hold of one of the suspects, who immediately began struggling to get away, and, in the process, hit Grayson in the eyes with pepper spray.

Grayson then forced the woman to the ground and continued to detain her until police arrived, authorities said. The two suspects were booked into Sonoma County Jail on suspicion of felony robbery and felony conspiracy to commit robbery. One was also booked on an additional charge of felony illegal use of a tear gas weapon.

""Although we encourage citizens to be good witnesses and not physically get involved in crimes in progress for their own safety, we are very thankful to the two citizens for their courageous actions which led to these arrests,"" Petaluma police said in a statement.

Superior Court, said landlords agreed to use RealPage's centralized system, which suggests rental prices based on supply and demand, rather than compete against one another. In addition, the suit said, landlords agreed to provide ""competitively sensitive data"" to RealPage for use in its software, a violation of D.C. antitrust law.

More than 50,000 units in the District were affected, according the suit, bringing ""millions in wrongfully inflated rents in the last four years alone.""

In a statement, RealPage spokesperson Jennifer Bowcock criticized the lawsuit.

""In seeking to draw a causal connection between revenue management software like ours and increases in market-wide rents, this copycat suit repeats the inaccuracies of predecessor cases,"" the statement said. ""The complaint and others like it are wrong on both the facts and the law and we will vigorously defend against it.""

The lawsuit seeks to stop the allegedly illegal price hikes and collect financial penalties from the companies to compensate the District and affected renters, among other relief.

""Defendants' anticompetitive agreement has exacerbated D.C.'s affordable housing crisis, forcing numerous District renters to overpay, month after month, for what is likely the single largest expense in their lives,"" the suit said. ""Every dollar of increased rent that the cartel illegally squeezes from District renters contributes to widening wealth gaps.""

In a statement, Schwalb (D) said the ""coordinated and anticompetitive conduct amounted to a District-wide housing cartel.""

""At a time when affordable housing in DC is increasingly scarce, our office will continue to use the law to fight for fair market conditions and ensure that District residents and law-abiding businesses are protected,"" the statement said.

RealPage's website says it ""helps owners, operators, property managers and investors unlock value faster.""

""Discover how we're driving operational excellence and optimizing the prospect and resident experience with market-leading technology that maximizes yield,"" the site says.

The suit said that RealPage's software has been adopted by a ""substantial portion"" of the multifamily housing market nationwide, including around 60 percent of units in large, multifamily buildings in the District.

The suit included a map of properties that showed alleged ""increased concentration"" of the software's use in particular neighborhoods, including Columbia Heights, NoMa and Navy Yard, and buildings along Connecticut Avenue in upper Northwest.

""As a practical matter, this leaves many District residents with no choice but to pay RealPage's inflated rents,"" the suit said.

Landlords also profited from the scheme, which sometimes incentivized leaving some units vacant to maximize return, the suit said.

""The net effect of driving revenue and pushing people out was $10 million in income,"" one executive quoted in the suit said. ""I think that shows keeping the heads in the beds above all else is not always the best strategy.""

The rents RealPage comes up with ""are not recommendations,"" the suit alleged. ""Participating Landlords agree to and do impose the RealPage-generated rents nearly all of the time.""

In a statement, Elena Bowers, supervising attorney in the housing unit at Legal Aid DC, said the District for years has felt the impact of the ""harmful practices"" the lawsuit alleges. Those affected are disproportionately Black and Brown residents, the statement said.

""We hope AG Schwalb's lawsuit will hold these landlords accountable and force them to change their deceitful practices going forward,"" the statement said.

Four consumers in New York, Hawaii, South Carolina and Georgia filed the lawsuit on Friday in San Jose, California, federal court. They alleged Apple violated U.S. antitrust law through its agreements with PayPal's (PYPL.O) Venmo and Block's (SQ.N) Cash App.

Apple's agreements limit ""feature competition"" within peer-to-peer payment apps, including prohibiting existing or new platforms from using ""decentralized cryptocurrency technology,"" the complaint said.

The lawsuit seeks an injunction that could force Apple to divest or segregate its Apple Cash business.

Cupertino, California-based Apple, the only defendant in the case, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Representatives for PayPal and Block, which were not sued, did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

The plaintiffs' attorneys at the law firm Bathaee Dunne declined to comment.

The case adds to Apple's recent antitrust headaches. A U.S. judge in California in September ruled that payment card issuers can sue Apple over alleged anticompetitive practices involving its Apple Pay mobile wallet.

Apple in another case has asked the U.S. Supreme Court to overturn an order in a lawsuit from ""Fortnite"" video game maker Epic Games challenging restrictions on in-app payment processing.

Peer-to-peer payments allow one user to send money via a mobile device directly to the account of another user.

The plaintiffs in the new lawsuit alleged Apple, Venmo and Cash App ""have repeatedly raised prices for transactions and services with no competitive check.""

They argued that a peer-to-peer app based on ""decentralized"" crypto technology ""would allow iPhone users to send payments to each other without any intermediary at all.""

The lawsuit said Apple has excluded from its App Store at least two Bitcoin wallet apps, Zeus and Damus, which is backed by Block founder Jack Dorsey.

An attorney for Phhhoto told the New York-based 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals that a lower trial court judge wrongly found the app's competition lawsuit against Meta was not filed in time.

Phhhoto accused Meta of manipulating an algorithm to suppress the app's animated photographs on the social media company's Instagram platform. U.S. District Judge Kiyo Matsumoto in Brooklyn dismissed the 2021 lawsuit in March because the allegations stemmed from 2016, outside the four-year window for antitrust plaintiffs to sue.

The case, which is one of several private and government lawsuits accusing Meta of anticompetitive practices, tests the legal principle of whether and when the statute of limitations can be extended.

Phhhoto launched in 2014 and said it had reached 10 million registered users two years later. It shut down in 2017.

Thursday's appeals court panel -- Chief Circuit Judge Debra Ann Livingston, sitting with Circuit Judges Denny Chin and Richard Wesley -- at points sounded skeptical of Phhhoto's contention that it could not have sued sooner.

""Don't you need to find something that occurred within the four years prior to the suit?"" Chin said at the hearing. Livingston pressed Phhhoto on ""warnings"" that might have given it ""some reason to worry that Meta was suppressing its content.""

Phhhoto's attorney, Scott Martin of the plaintiffs' firm Hausfeld, argued that Meta fraudulently ""concealed"" the change to its algorithm, making Phhhoto unable to immediately discern what was happening to the app and why.

""There was no evidence at all to lead them to believe that the algorithm was suppressing photo related content,"" Martin told the panel.

An attorney for Meta, Aaron Panner of Kellogg, Hansen, Todd, Figel & Frederick, countered that Phhhoto was ""on notice"" in 2016 about the impact of the algorithm change on the app's content.

""They can't explain why they waited five years to sue,"" Panner said.

Panner and Martin did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Meta has denied that it concealed anything from Phhhoto and urged the appeals court to uphold the dismissal of the lawsuit.

The case is Phhhoto Inc v. Meta Platforms Inc, 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, No. 23-0763.

Industry experts said this week's surprise legal verdict that the powerful National Association of Realtors (NAR) and several large brokerages conspired to inflate home commissions could eventually reduce real estate agents' fees and, crucially, lower costs for home buyers and sellers. At a minimum, the jury ruling will likely lead to greater transparency, long a source of confusion and frustration for consumers about where their money goes in real estate transactions.

The vast majority -- or nearly 90% -- of U.S. homes are bought and sold through real estate agents affiliated with NAR. The organization, the country's largest trade association, requires home sellers to offer a non-negotiable commission before listing homes on its property database, known as the Multiple Listing Service, or MLS, which feeds into real estate sites such as Zillow. Paid by the home seller to their agent as well as the buyer's agent, the commission currently stands at around 5% to 6% of a home's sale price.

Plaintiffs in the recent case in Kansas City successfully argued that the NAR's rule curtails competition and leads to higher prices. If not for MLS, buyers would compensate their own agents, as would sellers, they said.

Tuesday's verdict could bring that scenario into play, particularly if the judge in charge of the Missouri case issues an injunction prohibiting preset commission rates and shared commissions between buyers and sellers.

""The most impactful injunction would be one that bans cooperative compensation in the Multiple Listing Service on a national level, which the court has the authority to do,"" analysts with Keefe, Bruyette & Woods wrote in a report.

The Department of Justice is also looking at the issue of how real estate agents are compensated and whether those practices harm competition. Federal regulators could determine that those practices violate antitrust law, triggering a broader overhaul of how real estate agents are paid.

""It is possible that the DOJ would proactively weigh in during the injunction determination in order to make the changes that it believes is necessary to promote a fair and competitive market,"" the KBW analysts stated.

Changes to the payment structure for agents could cut the $100 billion annual commission pool for 1.6 million realtors by 30%, KBW estimated. ""A court-ordered injunction could 'unbundle' commissions nationally by early 2024, eliminating the longstanding practice of listing agents and sellers setting and paying buyer agent commissions,"" the analysts said.

ONAR and other defendants in the Missouri case have vowed to appeal the ruling, which ordered them to pay at least $1.8 billion to hundreds of thousands of homeowners who were required to pay what they argued were excessive fees to agents.

Home sellers have long grumbled about having to pay commissions to a buyer's brokers.

""The extent of injunctive relief decided by the court will strongly influence whether a price competitive system develops that lowers consumer costs and increases quality of service,"" Stephen Brobeck, a senior fellow at the Consumer Federation of America, said in a statement. ""We hope the court will sever the ties between the listing agent and buyer agent compensation, freeing sellers from the obligation and need to compensate buyer agents.""

Still, one industry veteran cautions against reading too much into the ruling for now, noting that the judge presiding over the Missouri case has yet to issue a final judgment in the case.

""Depending on what he does, it could require more disclosures by agents to both sellers and buyers about options they have -- that could happen and probably will happen,"" Steve Murray, a partner in Real Trends Consulting told CBS MoneyWatch.

That scenario would not involve a lot of change, other than ""more disclosures by both the listing agent and the buyer agent to their clients about who is getting what,"" he added.

Although the case placed a ""big red bullseye on the industry,"" Murray added, ""Consumers use the system because it works for them."" Buyers and sellers are not compelled by any law or regulation to use an agent to buy or sell a home, an option utilized in roughly 10% of home sales and purchases, he said.","{'uri': 'cbsnews.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'CBS News'}",[],https://assets2.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2021/10/14/79873dcc-9c19-48f0-a91d-4ce8a343dcdf/thumbnail/1200x630/aee1aced84580d63c2b5aadadb566736/forsale.jpg?v=c81a9d6c51e6280f2f4f876031d7d9bc,eng-9028352,0.1529411764705881,51,51,CBS News,cbsnews.com

The Association of Corporate Counsel on Wednesday filed a friend of the court brief in the FTC case in Seattle federal court, where the agency in June accused Amazon of tricking consumers into signing up for its Prime paid membership service and making it hard for them to leave.

The group's amicus brief warned that the agency's lawsuit improperly suggested Amazon officials knew they were breaking consumer protection law since they were in regular contact with lawyers familiar with the regulatory provisions at issue.

Association of Corporate Counsel chief legal officer Susanna McDonald said in a statement on Thursday that any effort to deter clients from speaking with their attorneys ""runs counter to the recognized role that attorney-client privilege for in-house counsel plays in supporting the administration of justice.""

Former Republican FTC Commissioner Maureen Ohlhausen, who now leads the antitrust group at law firm Baker Botts, was part of the team that filed the brief.

Amazon has denied the FTC's allegations and defended its practices. The company and the FTC declined to comment on Thursday.

The corporate counsel group was among several groups that submitted briefs in the case, providing the court with views on various matters.

The groups, which also included the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, are not parties in the litigation, part of the Biden administration's crackdown on major U.S. technology companies.

The FTC alleged in its complaint that Amazon has used ""manipulative, coercive or deceptive user-interface designs known as 'dark patterns' to trick consumers into enrolling in automatically renewing Prime subscriptions."" Prime offers its members free delivery and other deals.

The complaint said Amazon's in-house and outside attorneys have ""expertise"" with the regulations in focus and that ""key"" Amazon employees ""routinely conferred"" with company lawyers.

The company's attorneys argued in a recent filing that ""no lawful, reasonable negative inference can be drawn from corporate employees regularly conferring with counsel, let alone an inference of deliberate lawbreaking.""

A non-jury trial in the case is scheduled for February 2025 before U.S. District Judge John Chun.

The case is Federal Trade Commission v. Amazon.com, U.S. District Court, Western District of Washington, No. 2:23-cv-00932-JHC.

For FTC: Evan Mendelson, Jonathan Cohen, Olivia Jerjian and Thomas Nardini of FTC

For Amazon: Kenneth Payson of Davis Wright Tremaine; John Hueston of Hueston Hennigan; and Stephen Anthony of Covington & Burling

U.S. real estate brokerage HomeServices of America, owned by Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway (BRKa.N), has hired Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher's Theodore Boutrous, a court filing in the case in Kansas City, Missouri, federal court showed.

Boutrous has represented Chevron, Wal-Mart and other companies in high-stakes appeals, and is known for his advocacy for media organizations on transparency. He will lead the appeal for HomeServices in the St. Louis-based 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, a spokesperson for the company said.

The team is also expected to include former U.S. appeals judge Gregg Costa, co-leader of Gibson Dunn's trial practice, and antitrust partner Cynthia Richman.

The National Association of Realtors on Tuesday said Latham & Watkins' Gregory Garre, a former U.S. solicitor general who has argued nearly 50 cases at the U.S. Supreme Court, would help lead the organization's appeal. Garre's current cases also include defending Purdue Pharma's bankruptcy settlement at the Supreme Court.

Garre is working with Latham veteran appellate partner Roman Martinez, who has argued more than a dozen times at the high court.

Lawyers for the plaintiffs did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

A Kansas City jury determined on Oct. 31 that home sellers had paid inflated commissions to real estate brokers representing home buyers. The verdict will be automatically tripled to more than $5 billion under U.S. antitrust law.

The defendants, also including brokerage Keller Williams, have denied any conspiracy and vowed to pursue further legal challenges.

The appellate process is not anticipated to kick off until next year, following rounds of filings over post-trial matters, including whether evidence in the case justified the jury's verdict.

The realtors association's trial team included lawyers from Cooley, and HomeServices' firms included Foley & Lardner and MacGill P.C. Keller Williams' trial team included attorneys from Holland & Knight.

The Biden administration said in a ""statement of interest"" filed in Nashville, Tennessee, federal court on Wednesday that the judge should reject motions by RealPage and dozens of corporate landlords to throw out the cases.

The Justice Department is not a party in the litigation, but said it intends to participate at a Dec. 11 hearing where RealPage and others will ask the court to dismiss the renters' lawsuits.

The cases in April were consolidated in Nashville as part of multidistrict litigation. The defendants have denied wrongdoing, and RealPage has called the alleged conspiracy ""implausible.""

The class-action lawsuits on behalf of students and other renters claim landlords have shared non-public information -- including vacancy data -- with RealPage and relied on its algorithms to keep rental prices inflated above competitive levels.

The government's filing called algorithms ""the new frontier"" of price-fixing, and argued that the use of shared data and software must ""be subject to the same condemnation"" as other price-fixing schemes.

""Longstanding legal principles apply with equal force to this new machinery,"" the Justice Department said.

A spokesperson for Texas-based RealPage on Thursday did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The defense motions to dismiss are pending before Chief U.S. District Judge Waverly Crenshaw Jr.

RealPage is owned by Chicago-based private equity firm Thoma Bravo, which has called the plaintiffs' claims ""threadbare."" Thoma Bravo did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

The Justice Department declined to comment.

Lawsuits against RealPage and large property management companies began piling up last year. The plaintiffs said they have evidence from confidential witnesses to help buttress their claims of a price-fixing conspiracy.

The District of Columbia on Nov. 1 became the first governmental entity to sue RealPage over its pricing software. The District, working with a private law firm, alleged residents had paid ""millions of dollars above fair market prices.""

The case is In re: RealPage Rental Software Antitrust Litigation, U.S. District Court, Middle District of Tennessee, No. 23-md-03071.

U.S. Magistrate Judge Joseph Marutollo in Brooklyn in an order on Friday granted a request from plaintiffs' lawyers in the case to start a probe that could shut down the unauthorized site and void any client contracts that have come from it.

Marutollo set a deadline for the website to respond to an inquiry from him. A representative for the website did not immediately respond to an inquiry from Reuters.

Major class action settlements often feature websites with information for class members. The website at issue in the Visa and Mastercard case closely resembles the official U.S. court-authorized page set up as part of the 2019 settlement in the litigation in Brooklyn, New York, federal court.

Fraud claims have arisen from at least two other class action cases in recent months.

The judge overseeing 3M's $6 billion settlement of lawsuits alleging its earplugs caused hearing damage warned of an identity theft scam. Plaintiffs lawyers in the multibillion-dollar litigation in North Carolina over contaminated water at Camp Lejeune said they've seen efforts to dupe victims into paying unnecessary fees.

In the Visa and Mastercard case, retailers accused the companies of overcharging them on fees that are paid when consumers use credit or debit cards to make purchases. A U.S. appeals court in March upheld retailers' multibillion-dollar settlement. The companies denied wrongdoing.

Plaintiffs lawyers in a Nov. 3 filing in the case notified the court about what they called a ""highly suspicious"" settlement website.

They told the court that the website was brought to their attention by a company that said it received a voicemail purportedly from prominent rap artist Snoop Dogg touting the page. Snoop Dogg's business team on Monday did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

The attorneys who alerted the court did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Marutollo's order directed the settlement site to respond to why the court should not issue a report and recommendation to ""immediately take down the website.""

In an order on Thursday, U.S. Magistrate Judge Kendall Newman in Sacramento, California, federal court ruled for the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA), which argued that it did not have the information sought by the plaintiffs.

NCAA bylaws allowing it to acquire information from member schools ""are not meant to provide a discovery mechanism for plaintiffs to utilize,"" Newman wrote.

The unpaid coaches who brought the cases claim the NCAA and more than 300 member schools in its Division I -- the top tier for U.S. college athletics -- unlawfully agreed to pay them nothing in a wage-fixing conspiracy.

The plaintiffs include coaches for college baseball, tennis, indoor track, soccer and lacrosse, among other sports.

An NCAA spokesperson did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The NCAA has denied any wrongdoing.

Garrett Broshuis, an attorney for the plaintiffs, said on Friday ""we look forward to continuing to prosecute this case on behalf of these coaches, who were unfairly denied compensation for far too many years.""

The association lost its early effort to dismiss the two lawsuits, both of which were filed last year. The NCAA's Division I amended its rules in January to allow teams to pay an additional coach, a move that eliminated the volunteer posts.

In their bid to obtain pay data for other coaches, attorneys for the plaintiffs argued the ""NCAA has sweeping authority to obtain all kinds of information and documents upon demand from its member schools.""

The plaintiffs said a ruling for the NCAA would mean the ""plaintiffs will be forced to collect this material from the NCAA's 300+ Division I schools, spread across all fifty states.""

They predicted the effort would be ""highly burdensome, resulting in a huge number of subpoenas.""

In a filing, the NCAA's attorneys told the court that the association ""has no authority to compel [Division I] institutions to cooperate with production"" of information.

""Any burden of seeking relief from hundreds of institutions is a problem of plaintiffs' own making,"" the NCAA's attorneys said.

Newman also denied the plaintiffs' bid for NCAA communication about the change in its volunteer coach bylaw.

A jury trial before U.S. District Judge William Shubb is scheduled to start in September 2025.

The cases are Colon et al v. NCAA, U.S. District Court, Eastern District of California, No. 1:23-cv-00425-WBS-KJN, and Smart et al v. NCAA, same court, No. 2:22-cv-02125-WBS-KJN.

Attorneys for Vanderbilt said in a filing in federal court in Chicago on Friday that they ""have reached an agreement in principle to settle."" The filing did not reveal the terms of the deal, which will be subject to court approval once finalized.

A Vanderbilt spokesperson in a statement said ""we are proud of our institutional commitment to access and affordability for students and their families.""

The plaintiffs' lawyers leading the case said they ""look forward to finalizing the settlement documents and presenting them for approval by the court.""

Vanderbilt was among 17 elite schools sued last year in a prospective class action alleging that hundreds of thousands of students overpaid for college tuition amid a conspiracy to reduce how much financial aid is awarded. The schools have all denied wrongdoing.

The other defendants include Brown University, Yale University, Dartmouth College, Duke University and Massachusetts Institute of Technology. U.S. District Judge Matthew Kennelly in Chicago last year refused to dismiss the case.

The University of Chicago was the first school in the case to reach a settlement. Without admitting any wrongdoing, it agreed to pay $13.5 million and to cooperate with the plaintiffs' efforts to collect documents and other evidence, according to court papers.

At trial, the plaintiffs intend to argue that schools were not ""need blind"" and instead considered a prospective student's financial background as part of the admission process.

In a filing on Oct. 31, plaintiffs' lawyers alleged that ""Vanderbilt was eager to admit the children of its wealthiest donors, even if some were not up to Vanderbilt's exacting standards.""

Attorneys for Vanderbilt argued the plaintiffs were seeking test-records admissions data by student name ""to parade names before a jury -- not because they need it to prove their claims.""

Pittsburgh-founded Buchanan will bring on 22 lawyers and two patent agents from RatnerPrestia in Philadelphia, Washington, D.C., and Wilmington effective Jan. 1.

Buchanan, a law and lobbying firm, has about 450 lawyers and government relations professionals in 15 U.S. offices.

Jonathan Spadt, who was CEO and president of RatnerPrestia, will serve as a co-chair of Buchanan's IP section. Buchanan said the combination increases its IP group by 65% and boosts its presence in the mid-Atlantic region.

While IP used to be more of a standalone practice, IP work is now ""part of a much larger puzzle"" and increasingly integrated with other areas, including trade, regulatory and antitrust, Spadt said.

RatnerPrestia, which was founded in 1981, wanted to find a larger firm that could offer additional areas of expertise, he said.

The two firms started talking in March, according to Joseph Dougherty, chairman and CEO of Buchanan. The tie-up brings together two already-strong IP groups and opens up opportunities to bring in new clients, he said.

There were 41 completed law firm mergers through the first three quarters of 2023, up from 37 at that point in 2022, according to figures released last month by legal consultancy Fairfax Associates.

Law firm Rimon on Tuesday also said it will acquire a small IP firm named Davidson Berquist Jackson and Gowdey.","{'uri': 'reuters.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'Reuters'}","[{'uri': 'sara_merken@reuters.com', 'name': 'Sara Merken', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': False}]",https://www.reuters.com/resizer/5tUajE-7GOB9RrVGMCRQr71oAZ0=/728x381/smart/filters:quality(80)/cloudfront-us-east-2.images.arcpublishing.com/reuters/CSHHTY5ST5P5DCMQLU2XYUGEB4.jpg,,0.192156862745098,9,9,Reuters,reuters.com

Chicago-founded Baker McKenzie, the largest law firm in the U.S. by attorney head count, saw revenues hold steady at $3.3 billion in the fiscal year that ended June 30. Net income also remained flat at $1.2 billion.

The firm pointed to ""strong results"" despite challenges, including spinning off the firm's former operations in Russia. The firm also cited decreased corporate deal activity across markets and adverse currency and inflationary pressures.

Baker McKenzie was among the major law firms that reevaluated Russia operations last year in response to the Ukraine invasion and Western sanctions.

While other firms shuttered offices there, Baker McKenzie and some other foreign law firms withdrew from the Russian market by carving off their outposts into standalone firms. The firm, which had more than 200 employees in Russia, said in October that its former Russia operations launched as an independent law firm.

Baker McKenzie said it was buoyed last year by strong growth in the manufacturing, healthcare and energy and infrastructure sectors. Antitrust and competition, projects, employment and compensation, and mergers and acquisitions practices also saw ""robust performance,"" the firm said.

The financial results from Baker McKenzie, which is typically among the first U.S.-founded law firms to disclose annual revenues, offers an early glimpse at how big firms have been coping with a continuing slowdown in global deal-making, geopolitical uncertainties and other issues that have contributed to a challenging business environment over the past year.

Large London-founded firms that reported results over the summer, for financial years ending April 30, largely saw revenue growth and stalled profits.","{'uri': 'reuters.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'Reuters'}","[{'uri': 'sara_merken@reuters.com', 'name': 'Sara Merken', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': False}]",https://www.reuters.com/resizer/lx3Dqm3R897ELBo8gLA9OHRjov0=/728x381/smart/filters:quality(80)/cloudfront-us-east-2.images.arcpublishing.com/reuters/NNBGLXOMLVPZDAI4V6SJ4U2EFU.jpg,,0.03529411764705892,9,9,Reuters,reuters.com

Represented by lawyer David Boies, the companies--Massachusetts retailer Canna Provisions, marijuana delivery business owner Gyasi Sellers, Wiseacre Farm and multistate operator Verano Holdings-- sued U.S. Attorney General Merrick Garland in U.S. District Court in Massachusetts. The lawsuit claims that the federal Controlled Substances Act undermines state law, harms the owners' businesses and threatens their public safety by forcing them to operate largely on a cash basis.

Cannabis has been broadly legalized in 23 states, but the federal law, according to the lawsuit, prevents cannabis businesses from receiving loans from the Small Business Administration, saddles them with heavy taxes and prevents them from using trademark law to protect their intellectual property, among other effects. They also say the threat of federal enforcement has kept people and businesses within Massachusetts from working with the cannabis businesses.

""We want to be treated equally, on an even playing field with any other small business in Massachusetts,"" Meg Sanders, CEO and co-founder of Canna Provisions, said in a statement.

In 2005, the U.S. Supreme Court held that Congress' intent to ""eradicate"" marijuana from interstate commerce was enough to support the federal government's intrusion on state regulation of the drug.

""Outdated precedents from decades ago no longer apply,"" Boies said in a statement. ""The Supreme Court has since made clear that the federal government lacks the authority to regulate purely intrastate commerce.""

Boies is known for his work representing the U.S. government in its antitrust battle with Microsoft Corp and Vice President Al Gore in the U.S. Supreme Court battle over the 2000 presidential election recount. He has more recently drawn criticism over his work for Harvey Weinstein and failed blood testing startup Theranos.

Several multistate cannabis operators and cannabis investors Eminence Capital and Poseidon Investment Management said in a statement on Thursday that they retained Boies to file the lawsuit. It seeks a declaration that the Controlled Substances Act is unconstitutional when applied to state-legal operations and asks the court to ban the federal government from enforcing it against state-legal businesses.

Representatives for the U.S. Justice Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

The department's stance on enforcing federal drug laws against state-legal cannabis businesses has fluctuated between presidential administrations. Under President Barack Obama, prosecutors were told to limit their cases to a specific list of circumstances, which included blocking marijuana revenue from going to criminal enterprises.

That guidance was rescinded by the Trump administration in 2018.

In March, Garland testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee that the department's policy on marijuana enforcement was in development but would be ""very close"" to the policy under Obama.","{'uri': 'reuters.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'Reuters'}",[],https://www.reuters.com/resizer/wPgZczJ3RJerF447j1roCyxXv90=/728x381/smart/filters:quality(80)/cloudfront-us-east-2.images.arcpublishing.com/reuters/EUP4I7UVGRPNJEBX4JPCLBSJEE.jpg,eng-9010916,-0.1372549019607843,8,8,Reuters,reuters.com

The lawsuit filed in D.C. Superior Court marks the first government antitrust enforcement action against RealPage since last year, when it was hit with more than two dozen private civil lawsuits that are now consolidated in Nashville, Tennessee, federal court.

U.S.-based plaintiffs' law firm Cohen Milstein Sellers & Toll filed the complaint with lawyers from the D.C. attorney general's office, led by Attorney General Brian Schwalb. Cohen Milstein and other private firms have also worked with the office on other civil lawsuits.

In a statement, Schwalb said landlords conspired to keep rental prices high using RealPage's revenue management platform. The attorney general's office said District residents had paid ""millions of dollars above fair market prices.""

Richardson, Texas-based RealPage has denied any wrongdoing in the earlier cases, and it said it would contest the new D.C. case as well.

""In seeking to draw a causal connection between revenue management software like ours and increases in market-wide rents, this copycat suit repeats the inaccuracies of predecessor cases,"" RealPage spokesperson Jennifer Bowcock said.

Bowcock said the District's ""complaint and others like it are wrong on both the facts and the law and we will vigorously defend against it.""

RealPage, once a public company, is owned by Chicago-based private equity firm Thoma Bravo, which completed its acquisition in 2021.

The District's lawsuit alleged 14 landlords had ""conspired to share information, limit supply, and drive up rents"" using RealPage's software. It seeks triple damages and other relief ""to restore competitive conditions.""

""In a truly competitive market, one would expect competitors to keep their pricing strategies confidential -- especially if they believe those strategies provide a competitive edge,"" the lawsuit said.

It said RealPage's revenue software ""is used to set the rents at more than 50,000 units in the District -- a sizable portion of its available housing.""

Cohen Milstein's contract said it was entitled to 50% of any net recovery in the litigation, but no compensation if the city's case fails.

The case is District of Columbia v. RealPage Inc et al, Superior Court of the District of Columbia, unassigned.

Here are some of the potential prospects.

Election Day is a year away, but key allies of former President Donald J. Trump are already thinking about staffing a potential administration, including by filling White House and agency legal positions with aggressive and ideologically like-minded lawyers.

Trump allies are preparing to populate a new administration with a different breed of lawyer -- a departure from the type that stymied part of his first-term agenda and that despite their mainstream conservative credentials are seen as too cautious by people close to the former president. They are seeking lawyers in federal agencies and in the White House committed to his ""America First"" ideology and willing to use edgy theories to advance his cause.

It is too early to say with any certainty whom Mr. Trump would select were he to win a second term starting in 2025. But several conservative nonprofits, staffed by people who are likely to take on senior White House positions if there is a second Trump administration, have been putting together lists of prospects.

At Project 2025, a well-funded effort by the Heritage Foundation to prepare personnel and policy for the next conservative administration, John McEntee, one of Mr. Trump's most trusted aides, is part of a team searching for potential lawyers.

A person familiar with the Heritage 2025 project said it was listing multiple options for every position. Some of the names under early and unofficial consideration are:

Joseph E. Schmitz as the Pentagon's top lawyer. A Bush-era Pentagon inspector general, he argued after the 2020 election that the Supreme Court or the vice president, Mike Pence, should intervene to overturn Mr. Trump's loss.

Sarah B. Rogers in the Homeland Security Department. She is a former tobacco lawyer who brought a lawsuit against New York's attorney general, Letitia James, on behalf of the National Rifle Association as state prosecutors were investigating its finances.

Noah B. Peters in the Labor Department. He is a former solicitor for the Federal Labor Relations Authority who is also representing the N.R.A. in its legal troubles in New York. He has written columns critical of Big Tech for conservative websites like The Daily Caller and The Federalist.

James R. Lawrence III in the Health and Human Services Department. He is a critic of regulations and vaccine mandates whom Mr. Trump installed as acting chief counsel at the Food and Drug Administration in the waning days of his presidency.

Adam Candeub in the Commerce Department. He is a Michigan State University law professor and a critic of Silicon Valley. The Trump White House tried to install Mr. Candeub atop the Justice Department's antitrust division in 2020, a move the attorney general at the time, William P. Barr, blocked, believing he lacked relevant experience, according to people familiar with the matter. He was later tapped for another role in the Justice Department.

A similar personnel effort is being led by Stephen Miller, a former top policy aide in the Trump White House. He has since founded a nonprofit group, America First Legal, and has told colleagues that one of its goals is to spend several years evaluating conservative lawyers to find those who have the ""spine"" to be effective in an ideologically like-minded 2025 administration.

The lawyers on Mr. Miller's list, according to a person familiar with it, include:

Chad Mizelle, who as former acting general counsel of the Department of Homeland Security in the Trump administration worked closely with Mr. Miller to enact hard-line immigration policies.

Jonathan Mitchell, a former solicitor general of Texas who is considered a key architect of a state law that allowed private citizens to enforce anti-abortion restrictions.

Aaron Reitz, the chief of staff for Senator Ted Cruz and a former deputy attorney general under Mr. Miller's ally in Texas, Ken Paxton, who challenged many Biden policies in court. On a conservative podcast in late 2021, Mr. Reitz said that ""the sort of hyper-caution that I think too often Republicans demonstrate, not just in the legal space but political and elsewhere, the time for that is over,"" and that on Mr. Paxton's team, ""our soldiers are lawyers and our weapons are lawsuits and our tactic is lawfare.""

Brent Webster, first assistant deputy attorney general in Texas under Mr. Paxton who has been deeply involved in the office's antitrust cases, and who helped Mr. Paxton file a federal lawsuit seeking to overturn President Biden's victory in the 2020 election.

Reed Rubinstein, who worked in the Trump administration in various roles at the Justice, Education and Treasury departments, and is now at Mr. Miller's group.

John Zadrozny, a former legislative counsel at the Federation for American Immigration Reform who worked in several politically appointed roles in the Trump administration, where he was considered a Miller ally. He is now at America First Policy Institute, a think tank that employs many former Trump administration officials.","{'uri': 'nytimes.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'The New York Times'}","[{'uri': 'charlie_savage@nytimes.com', 'name': 'Charlie Savage', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': False}, {'uri': 'maggie_haberman@nytimes.com', 'name': 'Maggie Haberman', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': False}]",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2023/10/31/multimedia/00pol-trump-2025-sidebar-bcvt/00pol-trump-2025-sidebar-bcvt-videoSixteenByNine3000.jpg,,0.2078431372549019,6,6,The New York Times,nytimes.com
