bbc,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cjrpzxpv90eo,"The governor of the Bank of England has warned again that interest rates will not be cut in the ""foreseeable future"", saying it is ""too soon to have that discussion"".
Andrew Bailey said getting inflation, which is the rate consumer prices rise at, down to the Bank's 2% target would be ""hard work"".
Inflation has dropped sharply in recent months, falling to 4.6% in the year to October.
But Mr Bailey said getting inflation back down to the Bank's target was why he had ""pushed back of late against assumptions that we're talking about cutting interest rates"".
Mr Bailey also said he was concerned about the UK economy. ""If you look at what I call the potential growth rates of the economy, there's no doubt it's lower than it has been in much of my working life,"" he added.
His comments, in an interview with local news website Chronicle Live, external during a visit to the North East of England, come as a House of Lords committee report said that reforms were needed to improve the Bank of England's performance and accountability.
The Bank, which sets UK interest rates, has raised rates in recent times in its attempt to tackle rising prices, which have soared largely due to energy and food costs increasing in the aftermath of the Covid pandemic and Russia's invasion of Ukraine.
Interest rates are currently at 5.25%, a 15-year high, which has pushed up mortgage costs but also led to higher savings rates.
Despite inflation falling recently due to lower wholesale energy prices, Mr Bailey has repeatedly warned against suggestions that interest rate cuts will follow.
""I'm very conscious of the position of the less well-off,"" he told Chronicle Live.
""But we do have to get [inflation] down to 2% and that's why I have pushed back of late against assumptions that we're talking about cutting interest rates.""
The Bank first started to raise rates in December 2021 in an attempt to control inflation - but it is a balancing act. If rates go up too fast, consumers and businesses may spend and invest less which tends to drag on the economy.
The UK is not currently in recession but there have been concerns over weak economic growth.
In his Autumn Statement last week, Chancellor Jeremy Hunt announced some tax cuts for workers and businesses as the government attempts to boost growth, but the UK's overall tax burden is still on course to hit a record high.
A report by the House of Lords Economic Affairs Committee released on Monday said the framework for the Banks' independence had been tested by the rise in inflation and ""the resulting loss of public confidence in the Bank"".
It said ""all central banks, including the Bank of England"" had made errors in recent years, including forecasting inflation incorrectly.
""While we are of the strong view that independence should be preserved, reforms are needed to improve the Bank’s performance and to strengthen its accountability to Parliament,"" said Lord Bridges of Headley, chair of the committee.
The report said that a ""democratic deficit"" had emerged with ""critically important"" economic decisions being ""delegated to unelected officials"".
It suggested the Bank's remit be ""pruned"", in order to ""ensure that the Bank is focused on its primary objectives of tackling inflation and ensuring financial stability"".
""The Bank must do more to foster a diversity of views and strengthen a culture that encourages challenge,"" the report added.",economy
bbc,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-67539910,"Chinese officials have launched an investigation into one of the country's biggest shadow banks, which has lent billions to real estate firms.
Zhongzhi Enterprise Group (ZEG) has an asset management arm that at its peak reportedly handled more than a trillion yuan ($139bn; £110bn).
Authorities said they are investigating ""suspected illegal crimes"" against the firm, in a statement on the weekend.
This comes days after reports that ZEG had declared it was insolvent.
The struggling firm reportedly told investors in a letter last week that its liabilities - up to $64bn - had outstripped its assets, now estimated at about $38bn.
While authorities said they had taken ""criminal coercive measures"" against ""many suspects"" it's still unclear who they are, and what role they play in the firm. The company's founder, Xie Zhikun, died of a heart attack in 2021.
ZEG is a major player in China's shadow banking industry, a term for a system of lenders, brokers and other credit intermediaries who fall outside the realm of traditional regulated banking. Shadow banking, which is unregulated, is not subject to the same kinds of risk, liquidity and capital restrictions as traditional banks.
China's shadow banking industry is valued at around $3tn. It often provides a financial lifeline to the country's property sector. The once-booming industry has been hit by a severe credit crunch, with some of the biggest firms now on the brink of financial collapse.
""For several decades China been chasing this property bubble - and in order to create this bubble, or to fuel growth in China, they needed capital. So they started getting a lot of money from individual investors offering very, very high returns. And it worked for quite a while because the property prices were going up and it's a win-win for everybody,"" says Andrew Collier, a shadow banking expert at Orient Capital Research.
Informal lending has always existed in China's economy, but shadow banking really took off in the aftermath of the global financial crisis in 2008, when credit was scarce.
Given China's slowing economy and the crisis in the real estate sector, Mr Collier says the troubles at ZEG may just be the start of a bigger problem: ""This is going to spread further into other forms of shadow banks and potentially into the actual real brick-and-mortar banks.""

bbc,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-67535723,"Metro Bank shareholders have voted to back a rescue deal worth nearly £1bn aimed at securing the bank's future.
The agreement to raise extra funds from investors and refinance debt was struck last month after speculation about Metro's financial position.
The deal includes £325m in new funding and the refinancing of £600m of debt.
Metro said shareholders had voted ""overwhelmingly"" in favour of the deal, with nearly 93% of votes cast backing the package.
""This is testament to their belief and confidence in the future of Metro Bank and proves there is a place in retail and business banking for our model of stores in major towns and cities, combined with online and mobile banking and great customer service,"" the bank said.
Under the deal, Colombian billionaire Jaime Gilinski Bacal will become Metro's controlling shareholder with a 53% stake. His firm, Spaldy Investments, is putting £102m into the bank.
After the refinancing deal was agreed last month, Metro's chief executive, Daniel Frumkin, said it marked ""a new chapter"" for the bank.
The shareholder vote was the final hurdle after bondholders - who are set to lose 40% of their investments - backed the plan in October.

When it launched in 2010 Metro was the first new bank to open in the UK for more than a century.
It positioned itself as a so-called ""challenger"" bank to the big High Street names, and pledged to keep its branches open seven days a week.
The bank now has 2.7 million customers and holds about £15bn worth of deposits in 76 branches.
The lender has faced a number of challenges in recent years after an accounting scandal in 2019, which led to the departure of some top executives, including the bank's founder.
Metro's share price has slid from above £40 a share in 2018to 41p by mid-afternoon on Monday, though that was up 5.3% on the day.

Rishi Sunak has said the UK will not have a return to the close relationship with China pursued under David Cameron, as the prime minister met business leaders in an effort to drum up foreign investment.
The government on Monday said £29.5bn of new investment had been earmarked for the UK, including projects by the ScottishPower owner, Iberdrola, and BioNTech, the German company that partnered with Pfizer on its Covid vaccine.
Sunak met the heads of multinational firms including Goldman Sachs, Blackstone and JP Morgan at the summit in Hampton Court Palace, south-west London. The business leaders were due to dine later at Buckingham Palace with King Charles.
Predictions for UK growth were slashed at last week’s autumn statement, heaping pressure on the government to show signs it is acting to breathe life into an economy hit hard by rampant inflation.

David Cameron had courted Chinese investment in the UK as prime minister until 2016 when he resigned after the EU referendum. He returned to frontline politics this month as foreign secretary, leading to questions over whether he would change UK policy towards China after recent years of increased tensions. Cameron hosted a private session with business leaders at the summit.
However, Sunak signalled that he did not intend a change in UK policy. Speaking at the summit, he said: “If David Cameron were here he would say the China of today is not the China he dealt with a decade ago.”
Sunak said that China, the world’s second-largest economy, was an “indisputable fact of economic life” and there were “no solutions” to major global problems without China.
The prime minister made the comments during a panel with Steve Schwarzman, the billionaire chair and co-founder of the investment firm Blackstone. The chancellor, Jeremy Hunt, was due to host a panel including Jamie Dimon, the JP Morgan chief, and Khaldoon Al Mubarak of Abu Dhabi’s Mubadala Investment Company, also the chair of Manchester City.
Sunak said it was important for the UK to “reorient ourselves to places like the Middle East, Asia Pacific” when looking for investment. He also pitched the UK as an firm partner for allies, saying he wanted to “out-co-operate adversaries”.
The shadow trade and business secretary, Jonathan Reynolds, said: “The past 13 years of Conservative government has been marked by a complete lack of stability, consistency and ambition which has turned potential investors away from Britain.”
The government hailed a string of investments alongside the summit: a £10bn commitment from Australia’s IFM Investors into energy and infrastructure; £7bn from Iberdrola into UK electricity transmission and £5bn from Australia’s Aware Super into energy and housing businesses.

BioNTech, which developed the mRNA Covid jab, is to build a new laboratory in Cambridge, while Microsoft is to plough £2.5bn into AI infrastructure.
It is unclear which of the projects, if any, were a direct result of the investment summit.
The former UK prime minister Boris Johnson held a similar summit, at London’s Science Museum in October 2021, attended by high-profile business figures including the Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates. They were later hosted by the Queen at Windsor Castle.

the_guardian,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/nov/27/uk-interest-rates-will-stay-high-for-some-time-stresses-bank-of-england-governor,"Andrew Bailey has warned of a tough battle ahead to bring inflation back to its 2% target as he rammed home the message that there was no immediate prospect of the Bank of England cutting interest rates.
For the third time in a week, Threadneedle Street’s governor pushed back against speculation in the financial markets that official borrowing costs would soon be reduced from their level of 5.25%.
Bailey used an interview with Newcastle’s ChronicleLive to stress that October’s sharp drop in inflation from 6.7% to 4.6% was the result of the previous year’s surge in energy prices not being repeated rather than a marked easing of underlying price pressures.

“I’ve very much used this analogy of a game of two halves,” the governor said. “They’re not equal but a lot of what we’re seeing at the moment, including that inflation came down [over two percentage points], and that’s very good news, is the unwinding of these inflationary effects of these external shocks.”
Bailey said the fall in inflation did not mean prices were coming down, merely that they were now rising less quickly than a year earlier.
He added“We’re going to see some more of that unwind effect but we’re not going to see another month, I’m afraid, where it’s going down 2% because of that.”
At its last meeting earlier this month, six of the nine members of the Bank’s monetary policy committee voted to keep rates at 5.25%, while the other three opted for a quarter-point increase. Since then Bailey has used a speech in London and an appearance before the Commons Treasury committee to play down talk of rate cuts.
“I’m very conscious of the position of the less well-off but we do have to get it down to 2% and that’s why I have pushed back of late against assumptions that we’re talking about cutting interest rates or we will be cutting interest in anything like the foreseeable future because it’s too soon to have that discussion,” he told ChronicleLive.
“I recognise higher interest rates do have effects. They do have effects on mortgage costs, and they also have an effect on rental costs because they feed through. What I would say, to be honest, is that if we don’t get inflation down, it gets worse.”

Bailey said that by the end of the first quarter of 2024 inflation might be a little under 4% but getting it back to its 2% target thereafter would be the result of the Bank’s monetary policy.

the_guardian,https://www.theguardian.com/money/2023/nov/25/isas-uk-savers-to-get-freedom-to-chase-better-deals-as-rules-change,"Getting the best out of Isas should become easier for UK savers after the government announced a shake-up that will let them hop on to higher-paying accounts if they become available.
The autumn statement documents revealed ministers are making a series of changes to “simplify” Isas. As well as giving people more choice, these will reduce the risk of people accidentally breaking the rules. But some commentators argued that the various changes made the system more complicated, not less.
Tax-free Isas were introduced in 1999, and there are now six different types. The main two are the cash Isa and the stocks and shares Isa.
Every tax year savers can put money into one of each kind of Isa. They can save up to £20,000 in one type of account or split the allowance across some or all of the other types.
But from next April, savers will enjoy much more freedom and choice. They will be able to sign up to multiple Isas of the same type every year, provided the overall maximum Isa allowance isn’t breached. And partial transfers between different providers will also be allowed.
It means someone could open a Nationwide cash Isa in the autumn, then (assuming they have not used up all their allowance) they could take out a Halifax cash Isa after Christmas, and then pay into a Barclays cash Isa in the spring.
“The move to allow savers to open more than one Isa of each type will give them the freedom to shop around for the best deal,” said Karen Barrett at the financial adviser website Unbiased.
For cash Isa savers, the changes offer the opportunity to jump on to new, more competitive deals, added Sarah Coles at the investment platform Hargreaves Lansdown.
However, they were both disappointed that Jeremy Hunt did not take the opportunity to increase the overall Isa allowance. While £20,000 a year is more than enough for most people, upping the allowance would mean better-off people and those who have received a windfall could shelter more of their cash.
The allowance was last changed in 2017, so it would need to rise to more than £25,000 to keep pace with inflation, Coles said.
Cash Isas are the most popular type of Isa, and – after several years during which they fell out of favour with many people – they look set to make something of a comeback. That is because higher savings rates are likely to land hundreds of thousands more people with an unwelcome tax bill for their nest-egg cash if they didn’t, or don’t, use an Isa to protect their money. With some standard savings accounts offering almost 6% interest, some individuals with an emergency savings pot of less than £10,000 could find themselves breaching the personal savings allowance.
At the time of writing, the top-paying fixed-rate cash Isa was at Metro Bank, paying 5.71%. It also had an instant access Isa paying 5.11%. Virgin Money was offering a one-year deal paying 5.65%, though this was only open to people with a Virgin Money, Clydesdale Bank or Yorkshire Bank current account.
The chancellor also announced a few other tweaks to the Isa regime, including allowing “fractional shares” to be held within Isas. As the name suggests, a fractional share is a portion of a full share, and they allow people who don’t have enough money to buy a whole share to still invest in a business, Andrew Tully at the financial firm Nucleus said.
“Allowing people to hold fractional shares in Isas is a positive move, and may be appealing to younger generations in particular, who would like to invest in expensive stocks such as Apple, Tesla and Amazon,” he added. For example, this week Apple was trading at $191 (£152) a share.",economy

THE PM yesterday welcomed NISSAN’S £2billion investment in an electric car factory as a “huge vote of confidence” in the Government’s economic strategy.

The Japanese car giant announced it would build new e-versions of its Qashqai and Juke cars at its Sunderland site plus a model to replace the Leaf.

Rishi Sunak, who visited yesterday with Chancellor Jeremy Hunt, said “company after company” was committing to the UK, mentioning BMW, Stellantis and TATA.

He added: “They’re all voting with their feet. They’re putting money into the country, they’re creating jobs in the country. That’s a huge vote of confidence in this Government’s economic strategy.”

Alibaba founder Jack Ma has a new title: owner of “Ma’s Kitchen.”
China’s most famous tech billionaire has thrown his weight behind a newly formed startup, whose name in English translates to “Hangzhou Ma’s Kitchen Food.”
According to Chinese public records, the company was incorporated last Wednesday in Hangzhou, Ma’s hometown in eastern China that also serves as the base for e-commerce and tech giant Alibaba (BABA).
The new venture will focus on the sale of pre-packaged food, imports and exports, and selling “edible agricultural products,” according to China’s National Enterprise Credit Information Publicity System, a government-run corporate registry.
“Ma’s Kitchen” has registered capital of 10 million yuan ($1.4 million), the system showed.
The business is wholly owned by an entity named Hangzhou Dajingtou No. 22 Arts and Culture, of which Jack Ma has 99.9% ownership, according to Qichacha, a corporate data provider in China.
Jack Ma backs off on plans to sell Alibaba shares after stock plunge
The new firm has not publicly provided details on its business model, or what kind of food it will sell. The Jack Ma Foundation did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Monday.
Despite the scant details, the setup has prompted speculation that Ma may be looking to get in on a boom in ready-made meals in China.
The Chinese market for ready meals — food that is ready to heat and eat — was worth about 71.1 billion yuan ($9.9 billion) last year, up about 28% from 2018, according to Euromonitor International.
Demand for other types of pre-packaged food has also shot up, with the market for meal kits — food boxes that require simple assembly or cooking — nearly tripling from 10.6 billion yuan ($1.5 billion) in 2018 to 29.1 billion yuan ($4 billion) in 2022, Euromonitor data showed.
While the focus of Ma’s venture is not immediately clear, “this is a space that has a tremendous amount of room for innovation,” said Ben Cavender, managing director of China Market Research Group, a strategy consultancy.

“Packaged meals are becoming increasingly popular,” he told CNN. “Consumers in some cases are choosing these meals as they are trading down and not dining out as much, but are also choosing them for access to variety and due to time constraints.”
He said habits formed during the pandemic — to stay in and opt for convenient food options — as well as an economic slowdown in China were likely prompting more people to turn their attention to the space.
“If, instead, this ends up being more about sales of fresh foods like fruit, there is also demand for a wider variety of high-quality options and reasonable prices, and this is a space where his ties to e-commerce … would add value,” Cavender added.
Ma founded Alibaba in 1999. He stepped down as chairman of the company in 2019, about a year before landing in hot water with Chinese authorities for criticizing Chinese financial regulators and banks. Since then, the entrepreneur has kept a relatively low profile while remaining an Alibaba shareholder.
News of Ma’s latest foray came just as investors were paying close attention to his business interests: last week, he put off plans to sell hundreds of millions of dollars worth of Alibaba shares following a drop in the company’s stock.",economy
cnn,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/11/27/business/mcdonalds-burger-economy-nightcap/index.html,"New YorkCNN — 
Sticker shock, a feeling as old as commerce itself, is no longer just an irksome, unexpectedly high bill. In the era of social media, overpaying for dinner is an invitation for anyone and everyone to publicly shake their fist over the health of the global economy.
Take the $16 McDonald’s meal that struck a nerve on TikTok late last year. If you missed it, the gist is there’s a guy in Idaho who paid $16.10 for a burger, large fries and a drink.
“I get there’s a labor shortage. I get there’s wage increases and a number of other things,” he says in the video. “But $16? … It’s just crazy.”

Americans say the economy stinks. But they’re spending like it’s great
Even a year later, the video is being recirculated on TikTok, Reddit, the New York Postand Newsmax for what the moment ostensibly says about the state of the American economy.
That’s becoming an increasingly nettlesome problem for Democratic political strategists and economists who have so far failed to deliver the message that the economy is actually doing great.
Of course, fast food prices have gone up along with everything else in the past few years, but not by as much as the TikTok video suggests. The burger in the video isn’t a standard McDonald’s menu item — it was a one-off “smoky” double quarter-pounder with bacon and cheese, the kind of limited offering that fast-food restaurants often roll out in order to gin up sales in a business that runs on razor-thin margins.
The average Big Mac in America cost $5.58 this summer, according to the Economist. That’s up about 75 cents from January 2020, just before the pandemic hit. Because the vast majority of McDonald’s restaurants in the United States are independently owned, prices vary from region to region. (For example, in the wealthy town of Darien, Connecticut, a Big Mac combo meal can set you back about $18, as CBS News reported earlier this year and as I experienced first-hand on a pit stop along I-95.)
The social media megaphone
In an era before TikTok or YouTube, a $16 burger moment would have lasted a few seconds. The man who purchased it might have shaken his head and enjoyed his meal, or even gone back to the checkout to ask if there’d been a mistake when ringing up his order.
But in the social media era, the outrage gets published, elevated and amplified, feeding other people’s indignation about a world where food and housing and gas are more expensive than in the past.
Despite the inflation hangover keeping prices elevated, the economy, by almost any measure, should be one of the biggest feathers in President Joe Biden’s cap over the past three years. But American voters ﻿keep telling pollsters that they aren’t feeling all the good news that economists are seeing in the data.
In a CNN poll released earlier this month, 72% of all Americans say things in the country are going badly, and 66% said the economy will be “extremely important” when deciding whom to vote for next year.
A majority — 58% — told CNN in a poll released in September that Biden’s policies have made economic conditions worse.
Even the seemingly isolated incident of the $16 McDonald’s meal reached the desk of the White House Office of Digital Strategy, which tracked it as one of many exaggerated claims about the economy that the Biden administration is struggling to counter, according to the Washington Post.
The US government printed more than 750 million $50 bills in 2022. Here's why
00:57 - Source: CNN
The real beef
Perhaps the more significant economic takeaway from the viral McDonald’s meal is not that the meal actually cost $16 but that the man paid for it.
It’s not clear whether the TikTok user who posted the video, Topher Olive, saw the price of the special menu item before he ordered it. (He didn’t respond to CNN’s request to comment Monday.) But McDonald’s doesn’t hide its prices, and it’s clear Olive did pay for it because he filmed the receipt.
That part of the story mirrors a bigger economic trend — that Americans say they feel bad about the economy when asked by pollsters, but their actions tell a different story.
Despite higher prices and all-around sour mood, American consumers have been exceptionally willing to spend money on dining out, travel, concert tickets, and all manner of goods.
Consumer spending, the biggest engine of the US economy, powered US gross domestic product to grow at a stunning annualized rate of nearly 5% last quarter — more than double the quarter before that.
That doesn’t mean all Americans are thriving, but it does suggest that the historically strong labor market — unemployment has been under 4% for nearly two years — is giving workers a sense of security about their future paychecks.",economy
cnn,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/11/28/investing/premarket-stocks-markets-2024/index.html,"New YorkCNN — 
It’s been a topsy-turvy year for markets, but the S&P 500 hit a four-month high last week and a growing chorus of analysts says that momentum will continue into 2024.
A few of them even believe that the benchmark index will reach a new all-time high next year.
What’s happening: Investors entered this year uncertain about the economy, but things turned out better than expected. A feared recession didn’t happen and inflation eased.
“2023 defied almost everyone’s expectations: recessions that never came, rate cuts that didn’t materialize, bond markets that didn’t bounce, except in short-lived, vicious spurts, and rising equities that pained most investors who remained cautiously underweight,” said Candace Browning, head of Bank of America global research.
Analysts at several Wall Street banks think inflation will continue slowing into next year. They predict that central banks will lower interest rates while keeping prices stable and without causing an economic downturn.
“We expect 2024 to be the year when central banks can successfully orchestrate a soft landing, though recognize that downside risks may outnumber the upside ones,” said Browning.
That’s good news for markets. RBC, Bank of America, BMO Capital Markets and Deutsche Bank all predict that the S&P 500 will hit an all-time high next year.
Goldman Sachs analysts added that “the hard part” is over for the US economy. They see “only limited recession risk” of about 15% in 2024.
What analysts are saying: “While the November rally has likely pulled forward some of 2024’s gains, we remain constructive on the US equity market in the year ahead,” wrote Lori Calvasina at RBC Capital Markets in a note last week.
She expects the S&P to gain about 10% over the next 12 months, ending 2024 at 5,000. The S&P 500 currently sits around 4,550.
Bank of America’s Savita Subramanian echoed that bullish sentiment, writing on Monday that she forecasts the S&P 500 will also end the year at an all-time high of 5,000 (the current record closing high of 4,797 was reached in January 2022).
Markets won’t necessarily rise because the Federal Reserve is expected to begin cutting rates next year, said Subramanian, but because corporations have already proven that they can successfully adapt to changes in Fed policy while reporting strong earnings.
BMO’s chief investment strategist Brian Belski has predicted that the S&P 500 will close out 2024 at a healthy 5,100.
“We believe 2024 will be year two of at least a 3-5 year process that will see US stocks exhibit more normal and typical performance, paced by a backdrop of normal and typical GDP and earnings growth, valuation, and bond yield ranges,” he wrote in a note.
Analysts at Deutsche Bank also predict that 2024 will be for the bulls.
Analyzing earnings: This earnings season marked a return toward normal for S&P 500 companies after the past few years of pandemic shutdowns, inflation woes and recession confusion.
The number of firms discussing inflation during their earnings calls was the lowest it has been since the second half of 2021, and recession talk fell for the fifth straight quarter in a row, according to FactSet data.
Analysts are predicting (year-over-year) corporate earnings growth of 6.7% for the first quarter of 2024 and growth of 10.5% for the second quarter of next year, found FactSet.
All eleven sectors are projected to report year-over-year earnings growth by the second quarter next year, according to the data analytics company. 
The S&P 500 has gained about 18.5% so far this year after falling nearly 20% in 2022.
Americans may have spent a record $12 billion online yesterday
Enticed by deep discounts, Americans were expected to celebrate Cyber Monday by spending a record-setting $12 billion shopping online, reports my colleague Matt Egan.
Black Friday sales were also strong — especially online — providing the latest evidence of resilient consumer spending in the face of a host of challenges.
Despite elevated borrowing costs, three years of high inflation and increasing numbers of Americans dipping into their retirement plans, consumers continue to keep the US economy chugging.
It’s another reminder that it rarely pays to underestimate the willingness of Americans to spend regardless, even if they have less money in their bank accounts — especially when consumers perceive deals for the taking.
“This is a US economy and a US consumer that has been able to manage through a high-inflationary environment,” Michelle Meyer, chief US economist at the Mastercard Economics Institute, told CNN on Monday.
Americans are expected to spend $37.2 billion in online shopping during Cyber Week, the five days from Thanksgiving to Cyber Monday, according to Adobe Analytics. That would be 5.4% higher than last year.
Adobe estimates Cyber Monday spending will increase by 6.1% to $12 billion.
Google to begin deleting inactive accounts this week
That Google account you haven’t checked in years might be getting wiped this week.
Beginning Friday, Google is moving ahead with its plan to delete accounts that have been inactive for at least two years, reports my colleague Jennifer Korn.
The company announced the new policy back in May, saying it’s intended to prevent security risks: Internal findings show older accounts are more likely to rely on recycled passwords and less likely to employ up-to-date security measures like two-step-verification, making them far more vulnerable to issues like phishing, hacking and spam.
In a phased approach, the first accounts to be cut are those that were created and then never revisited by the user, Google said in May.
“We want to protect your private information and prevent any unauthorized access to your account even if you’re no longer using our services,” Google wrote in an August policy update.
Google accounts include everything from Gmail to Docs to Drive to Photos, meaning all content sitting across an inactive user’s Google suite is at risk of erasure.",economy
cnbc,https://www.cnbc.com/2023/11/27/shein-files-for-us-ipo-as-fast-fashion-giant-looks-to-expand-its-global-reach.html,"Shein has confidentially filed to go public in the U.S. as the Chinese-founded fast-fashion juggernaut looks to expand its global reach with a long-rumored initial public offering, CNBC has learned. 
The retailer was last valued at $66 billion and could be ready to start trading on the public markets as soon as 2024, people familiar with the matter said Monday. 

It is unclear how much the company is currently worth, but its valuation has been a central point of debate among Shein and the advisors it’s working with, people familiar with the matter said.

Read more: Shein has to clear key hurdles before U.S. IPO
A confidential filing is common, as it allows companies to communicate with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and make any necessary adjustments to their filings in private. Over the next few months, Shein will likely make tweaks to its paperwork and answer numerous questions from the agency. The filing will be made public once the company is ready to move forward with its IPO. At that point, those communications with the SEC and any adjustments to its paperwork will be released as well.
Shein has been on a meteoric rise over the past few years after it won over consumers across the globe with its fashion-forward designs, endless assortment and dirt-cheap prices. But Shein has faced a series of challengesalong the way and faced accusations of using forced labor in its supply chain, violating labor laws, harming the environment and stealing designs from independent artists.
The company is currently under investigation by the newly formed House Select Committee on the Chinese Communist Party and has faced scrutiny over its ties to Beijing. Numerous lawmakers, including 16 Republican attorneys general, have called on the SEC to ensure Shein isn’t using forced labor in its supply chain before it’s allowed to start trading in the U.S.

In October, Marcelo Claure, the company’s newly minted group vice chair and former SoftBank CEO, told CNBC in an interview that Shein is cooperating with lawmakers and taking time to meet with them to explain the business. He said, “there’s no such thing as forced labor” in the Shein factories that he has visited. But the company has repeatedly acknowledged that forced labor has been found in its supply chain and noted that it’s taking steps to fix it.
As Shein grew from an obscure Chinese retailer into a global behemoth with headquarters in Singapore, it largely stayed in the shadows. It said and did very little publicly until this year, when it began to open up in an apparent attempt to prepare for a U.S. IPO.
With Chinese CEO Sky Xu still at the helm, Shein tapped former Bear Stearns investment banker Donald Tang to be its executive chair and public face earlier this year. It has hosted a series of well-publicized pop-up events, sent influencers to its Chinese factories in a poorly received public relations campaign and courted the business press with splashy parties that featured its independent designers and other friends of the company.
Shein has worked hard to beat the many negative accusations that have come to define the company and has made its executives available for interviews as it worked to change the narrative.
Recently, it acquired about one-third of Sparc Group — a joint venture that includes brand management firm Authentic Brands Group and mall owner Simon Property Group — and in doing so, made a powerful U.S. ally that could help legitimize the company in the eyes of U.S. regulators.
As part of the deal, Shein has partnered up with former rival Forever 21 to unveil a co-branded clothing line that will see Shein design, manufacture and distribute the clothes primarily on its website. Shein has been hosting pop-up events inside of Forever 21′s stores.
Shein still has more work to do before it can win the trust of U.S. regulators.Beyond its myriad of issues, its CEO remains a mysterious figure who doesn’t give interviews or speak publicly about the company. The practice is a major departure from other firms that are publicly traded in the U.S., which regularly make their CEOs available. In October, the company did not tell CNBC whether Xu is still a Chinese citizen.
The company has tapped Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan and Morgan Stanleyto be the lead underwriters on the offering, the people said.

cnbc,https://www.cnbc.com/2023/11/27/zions-comerica-first-horizon-regional-bank-takeover-risk.html,"A trio of regional banks faces increasing pressure on returns and profitability that makes them potential targets for acquisition by a larger rival, according to KBW analysts.

Banks with between $80 billion and $120 billion in assets are in a tough spot, says Christopher McGratty of KBW. That’s because this group has the lowest structural returns among banks with at least $10 billion in assets, putting them in the position of needing to grow larger to help pay for coming regulations — or struggling for years.


Of eight banks in that zone, Comerica
, Zions
 and First Horizon
 might ultimately be acquired by more profitable competitors, McGratty said in a Nov. 19 research note.

Zions and First Horizon declined comment. Comerica didn’t immediately have a response to this article.

While two others in the cohort, Western Alliance
 and Webster Financial
, have “earned the right to remain independent” with above-peer returns, they could also consider selling themselves, the analyst said.

The remaining lenders, including East West Bank, Popular Bank and New York Community Bank each have higher returns and could end up as acquirers rather than targets. KBW estimated banks’ long-term returns including the impact of coming regulations.

“Our analysis leads us to these conclusions,” McGratty said in an interview last week. “Not every bank is as profitable as others and there are scale demands you have to keep in mind.”

Banking regulators have proposed a sweeping set of changes after higher interest rates and deposit runs triggered the collapse of three midsized banks this year.

• Excluding volatile food and energy prices, the core CPI rose 0.2% and 4%, against the forecast of 0.3% and 4.1%. The annual rate was the smallest increase since September 2021.
• The flat reading on the headline CPI came as energy prices declined 2.5% for the month, offsetting a 0.3% increase in the food index.
• Following the report, traders took any potential Fed rate hikes almost completely off the table, according to CME Group data.

Inflation was flat in October from the prior month, core CPI hits two-year low
Inflation was flat in October from the previous month, providing a hopeful sign that stubbornly high prices are easing their grip on the U.S. economy and giving a potential green light to the Federal Reserve to stop raising interest rates.
The consumer price index, which measures a broad basket of commonly used goods and services, increased 3.2% from a year ago despite being unchanged for the month, according to seasonally adjusted numbers from the Labor Department on Tuesday. Economists surveyed by Dow Jones had been looking for respective readings of 0.1% and 3.3%.

The headline CPI had increased 0.4% in September.
Excluding volatile food and energy prices, the core CPI increased 0.2% and 4%, against the forecast of 0.3% and 4.1%. The annual level was the lowest in two years, down from 4.1% in September, though still well above the Federal Reserve’s 2% target. However, Fed officials have stressed that they want to see a series of declines in core readings, which has been the case since April.
Markets spiked following the news. The Dow Jones Industrial Average roared higher by nearly 500 points as Treasury yields fell sharply. Traders also took any potential Fed rate hikes almost completely off the table, according to CME Group data.
“The Fed looks smart for effectively ending its tightening cycle as inflation continues to slow. Yields are down significantly as the last of investors not convinced the Fed is done are likely throwing in the towel,” said Bryce Doty, portfolio manager at Sit Fixed Income Advisors.
The flat reading on the headline CPI came as energy prices declined 2.5% for the month, offsetting a 0.3% increase in the food index. It was the slowest monthly pace since July 2022.

Shelter costs, a key component in the index, rose 0.3% in October, half the gain in September as the year-over-year increase eased to 6.7%. Within the category, owners equivalent rent, which gauges what property owners could command for rent, increased 0.4%. A subcategory that includes hotel and motel pricing dropped 2.9%.
“This is a game changer,” Paul McCulley, former chief economist at Pimco and now an adjunct professor at Georgetown University, said on CNBC’s “Squawk on the Street.” “We’re having a day of rational exuberance, because the data clearly show what we’ve been waiting for for a long time, which is a crack in the shelter component.”
Chicago Fed President Austan Goolsbee called the report “slow but clear progress” on getting inflation back to healthy levels.
Vehicle costs, which had been a key inflation component during the spike in 2021-22, fell on the month. New vehicle prices declined 0.1%, while used vehicle prices were off 0.8% and were down 7.1% from a year ago.
Airfares, another closely watched component, declined 0.9% and are off 13.2% annually. Motor vehicle insurance, however, saw a 1.9% increase and was up 19.2% from a year ago.
The report comes as markets are closely watching the Fed for its next steps in a battle against persistent inflation that began in March 2022. The central bank ultimately increased its key borrowing rate 11 times for a total of 5.25 percentage points.
While markets overwhelmingly believe the Fed is done tightening monetary policy, the data of late has sent conflicting signals.
Nonfarm payrolls in October increased by just 150,000, indicating the labor market finally is showing signs that it is reacting to Fed efforts to correct a supply-demand imbalance that has been a contributing inflation factor.
Labor costs have been increasing at a much slower pace over the past year and a half as productivity has been on the rise this year.
Real average hourly earnings — adjusted for inflation — increased 0.2% on a monthly basis in October but were up just 0.8% from a year ago, according to a separate Labor Department release.
More broadly speaking, gross domestic product surged in the third quarter, rising at a 4.9% annualized pace, though most economists expect the growth rate to slow considerably.
However, other indicators show that consumer inflation expectations are still rising, the likely product of a spike in gasoline prices and uncertainty caused by the wars in Ukraine and Gaza.
Fed Chair Jerome Powell last week added to market anxiety when he said he and his fellow policymakers remain unconvinced that they’ve done enough to get inflation back down to a 2% annual rate and won’t hesitate to raise rates if more progress isn’t made.
“Despite the deceleration, the Fed will likely continue to speak hawkishly and will keep warning investors not to be complacent about the Fed’s resolve to get inflation down to the long-run 2% target,” said Jeffrey Roach, chief economist at LPL Financial.
Even if the Fed is done hiking, there’s more uncertainty over how long it will keep benchmark rates at their highest level in some 22 years.

BBC Wales environment correspondent
Kebab shops along Cardiff's most famous takeaway street have said they are prepared for a ban on single-use plastics - but it could mean pricier takeaways.
Disposable plastic cutlery and trays are among the commonly littered products being outlawed in Wales.
Several traders spoke of a scramble in recent weeks to get hold of more expensive eco-friendly alternatives.
It follows similar bans in England and Scotland.
The Welsh government said the changes - which take effect on Monday - would help tackle ""the damaging flow of plastic waste"" into the environment.
Cardiff's Chippy Lane
Dubbed Chippy Lane, Caroline Street in Cardiff city centre is one of Wales' busiest takeaway hotspots.


Image caption, 
Alternative packaging is in short supply, says kebab shop owner Sam Raslan
At Fellas kebab shop, manager Sam Raslan said they were using up the last of their polystyrene trays ahead of the new restrictions.
""We're starting to swap to equipment that's healthier (for the environment),"" he said.
""But it costs us more than three times more than before.""
It comes on top of dramatic rises in ingredient and energy costs, leading to arguments with customers over the higher price of takeaways, he added.
• Plastics ban 'may not be fully enforced until 2026'
• Single-use plastics ban unveiled for Wales
With a similar ban on disposable plastics having come into force in England last month, another issue has been getting hold of supplies of eco-friendly products.
""Everyone is trying to get it, but there's not enough stuff in the market at the moment,"" he said.
""Our suppliers only have limited quantities, but it's coming day-by-day.""
Tamer Ali of Tony's Fish Bar agreed more environmentally-friendly containers were ""very expensive"".
""But what can we do?"" he asked, adding that he hoped once everybody had made the switch ""the prices will come down"".


Image caption, 
Nasir Ahmadzai says he has already made changes ahead of the ban
At Rotana Grill House, owner Nasir Ahmadzai said council officials had been up and down the street raising awareness of the ban.
""I'm feeling 100% that we're ready for it,"" he said, pointing out that the shop had switched to wooden cutlery and recyclable cartons in recent months.
""People used to complain about the plastic forks,"" he added, hoping the switch will help attract customers. 
What is being banned?
Single-use plastic plates, cutlery, drink stirrers, cotton buds and balloon sticks are all on the list.
Also banned are disposable cups and takeaway food containers made of expanded or foamed extruded polystyrene. 
Plastic drinking straws are forbidden too, though there are exemptions for people who need them to drink safely or independently.


Image caption, 
Wales' ban on single-use plastics comes into effect today
Businesses, charities and public organisations like schools and councils risk committing a criminal offence if they supply or display these products.
This is the first phase of the ban. The next one includes outlawing single-use carrier bags, polystyrene lids for cups and food containers made of oxo-degradable plastics.
This will come into force before the end of the Senedd term in 2026, the Welsh government said.
What are the alternatives?
Welsh government guidance on the law change said businesses could swap to non-plastic disposable products, made of materials like paper, card or wood.
Plates with any sort of plastic coating have also been banned.
Even better for the environment would be encourage the use of re-usable materials, and allowing customers where possible to bring their own containers.
Dr Rebecca Colley-Jones, whose company Ynys Resources advises businesses on recycling and sustainability, said changing our ""throwaway society"" was the real priority.
""If we changed everything to paper and that all went into landfill or to be burnt then that's not necessarily a better option - that material still needs to come from somewhere,"" she said.
""What we need to tackle is the way we actually behave and hopefully this will help push people into that.""
Lessons from a plastic-free community
Aberaeron on the Ceredigion coast is one of several communities in Wales working towards plastic-free status - an accolade awarded by environmental campaign group Surfers Against Sewage.
Clare Cowan opened her cafe seven years ago and made a point of not using single-use plastics from the start.
""We're perhaps more aware of the problem, living by the ocean,"" she said.

Clare Cowan has never allowed single-used plastics at her cafe
""It comes at quite a considerable cost comparison to the cheaper polystyrene or plastic containers. A cardboard cake box can cost up to £1 for one box, a cup comes in at just under 50p.""

She said she hoped the ban would ""move everybody in the right direction"".",environment

The council said it aimed to achieve ""biodiversity net gain"" for habitats around the road, as set out by the Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs.
However, Helen Baczkowska, a senior manager for the Norfolk Wildlife Trust’s nature recovery team, said no amount of mitigation could offset the damage caused by building the road.
""There are other impacts other than just carbon around the road,"" she said.
""Obviously there's noise and light pollution, which creatures like bats are incredibly sensitive to, and things like badgers and bats will be at a higher risk of collisions.""
The area around the proposed dual carriageway is thought to contain Britain’s largest colony of the threatened Barbastelle bat, external which is protected by law.
Other groups that oppose the plans include Stop the Wensum Link, CPRE Norfolk, Friends of the Earth, the Woodland Trust, Norfolk and Norwich Naturalists’ Society, Buglife, Norfolk and Norwich Bat Group and British Dragonfly Society.

The Western Link Road would form a new ring road around the city, connecting the Broadland Northway - known as the Norwich Distributor Road - at the A1067 with the A47 at Easton
The Department for Transport has approved the scheme and the Conservative-run county council revealed it will formally put in a planning application in early 2024, with preparatory building work starting at the end of 2025.
Construction will begin in the summer of 2026 and the road should open in 2029.

bbc,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-67330650,"A partnership to safeguard and restore part of the rural landscape in Wales and England has been launched. 
The cross-border project, Wilder Marches, aims to help nature struggling in the face of intensive farming and extensive forestry plantations.
It will also protect and promote strongholds of species like freshwater pearl mussels, pine marten and curlew. 
It involves wildlife trusts in Montgomeryshire and Radnorshire, and Shropshire, and Herefordshire.
They will concentrate on approximately 247,000 acres - roughly the size of 123,500 football pitches - straddling the Welsh-English border.
• Devastating loss of wildlife in Wales, says report
• The bygone island fort reclaimed by nature
Containing rivers such as the Lugg and the Teme, the area is home to long-established rural communities and dotted with ancient woodlands, heathlands and peatland.
There are also flower-rich meadows, wood pasture and a special upland habitat of scrub and grassland, known as ffridd in Welsh. 
It is also hoped by both creating and restoring these lost habitats the risk of flooding will be reduced and the quality of water improved.
The Marches also have areas of intensive farming, as well as extensive forestry plantations where nature is struggling to thrive. 
In collaborating with farmers and landowners the initiative plans to encourage regenerative methods of working the land, including conservation grazing with native breeds and the promotion and development of local sustainable food production.It is hoped the current reform of farm subsidies will present an opportunity to develop these new business models.

Saudi Arabia is driving a huge global investment plan to create demand for its oil and gas in developing countries, an undercover investigation has revealed. Critics said the plan was designed to get countries “hooked on its harmful products”.
Little was known about the oil demand sustainability programme (ODSP) but the investigation obtained detailed information on plans to drive up the use of fossil fuel-powered cars, buses and planes in Africa and elsewhere, as rich countries increasingly switch to clean energy.
The ODSP plans to accelerate the development of supersonic air travel, which it notes uses three times more jet fuel than conventional planes, and partner with a carmaker to mass produce a cheap combustion engine vehicle. Further plans promote power ships, which use polluting heavy fuel oil or gas to provide electricity to coastal communities.
The ODSP is overseen by Saudi Arabia’s de facto ruler, the crown prince Mohammed bin Salman, and involves its biggest organisations, such as the $700bn Public Investment Fund, the world’s largest oil company, Aramco, the petrochemicals firm Sabic, and the government’s most important ministries.
In publicly available information, the programme is largely presented as “removing barriers” to energy and transport in poorer countries and “increasing sustainability”, for example by providing gas cooking stoves to replace wood burning.
However, all the planned projects revealed in the investigation by the Centre for Climate Reporting and Channel 4 News involve increasing the use of oil and gas. An official said this was “one of the main objectives”.
The head of the World Bank said recently that rich countries and companies needed to help developing countries leapfrog over the fossil-fuelled economic growth of the past and roll out renewable energy. If they did not, Ajay Banga said, there was no hope of ending carbon emissions by 2050, as the world’s scientists had repeatedly made clear was necessary to avoid climate catastrophe.
Saudi Arabia has said it is committed to the Paris agreement’s climate goals to restrict global heating to well below 2C while aiming for a 1.5C rise at most. To achieve this, fossil fuel emission must fall rapidly and most oil and gas reserves must be kept in the ground, meaning climate policies, such as support for electric cars, pose a significant threat to the oil-rich state’s revenues.",environment
the_guardian,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/nov/27/us-oil-gas-record-fossil-fuels-cop28-united-nations,"The United States is poised to extract more oil and gas than ever before in 2023, a year that is certain to be the hottest ever recorded, providing a daunting backdrop to crucial United Nations climate talks that hold the hope of an agreement to end the era of fossil fuels.
The US’s status as the world’s leading oil and gas behemoth has only strengthened this year, even amid warnings from Joe Biden himself over the unfolding climate crisis, with the latest federal government forecast showing a record 12.9m barrels of crude oil, more than double what was produced a decade ago, will be extracted in 2023.

World stands on frontline of disaster at Cop28, says UN climate chief

Records will also be broken this year for gas production, with a glut of new export terminals on the Gulf of Mexico coast facilitating a boom that will see US exports of liquified natural gas (or LNG) double in the next four years.
Tellingly, the US government expects this frenzy of oil and gas activity to continue at near-record levels right up to 2050, a point at which scientists say planet-heating emissions must be eliminated to avoid catastrophic climate breakdown. A third of the world’s planned oil and gas expansion in this period will occur in the US, a recent report found.
At the Cop28 climate summit, starting in Dubai this week, the European Union and a cadre of “high ambition” countries that range from Kenya to Samoa will push for an agreed “phaseout” of fossil fuels. António Guterres, secretary general of the UN, has called fossil fuel production the “poisonous root” of the climate crisis that should be dismantled. “Cop28 must send a clear signal that the fossil fuel age is out of gas, that its end is inevitable,” he said.
The US’s surging fossil fuel production casts a pall over such ambitions, however. “It’s particularly alarming to see the projections of record US oil and gas production year after year until 2050,” said Michael Lazarus, a senior scientist at Stockholm Environment Institute, which helped produce a recent UN report finding the world is planning double the amount of fossil fuel production consistent with remaining within a 1.5C (2.7F) global temperature rise compared with pre-industrial times.
“The US is locking in production for years that makes it hard to meet climate goals,” he said. “It’s out of sync and it needs reckoning.”
Under Biden, the US has passed its first major climate legislation, called the Inflation Reduction Act, which has spurred record investment in clean energy such as solar and wind, as well as propel sales of electric vehicles.
The US president’s administration has fashioned new pollution rules to slash emissions from cars, trucks and power plants and recently struck a renewed agreement with China, the only country that emits more carbon than the US, to do more to stem the climate crisis. US energy emissions, meanwhile, have been edging downwards and are expected to drop 3% this year, albeit at a slower rate than needed to meet its own climate goals.
But the proliferation of domestic oil and gas drilling has alarmed scientistsand some of Biden’s allies, who fret that it undermines efforts to avert a looming 3C in global heating that Guterres has described as “hellish”.
Jeff Merkley, a Democratic senator from Oregon, said US negotiators will be “unable to lead the phaseout of fossil fuels” at Cop28. “Not only do we produce more oil and gas than any other country, but Team Biden is greenlighting one fossil project after another,” said Merkley. “The US is devoid of any moral authority to phasing out fossil fuels.”
The increased fossil fuel production, which Biden championed last year as a way to tamp down gasoline prices for US drivers and to support overseas allies in the wake of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, also risks burdening disadvantaged communities living next to polluting infrastructure and threatens to alienate younger, climate-conscious voters ahead of next year’s presidential election, an adviser to the White House has cautioned.
“They say they want to be leaders on climate but then do the opposite,” said Jerome Foster, a climate activist and member of the White House environmental justice advisory council. “It’s a mixed record and it’s really sad to see. President Biden said he would be the climate president but we aren’t seeing that. He’s not keeping his promises, he’s not got gen Z’s back.”
The US delegation to the Cop28 summit – Biden is not expected to attend this year – has indicated it would support agreement language that calls for the phase out of fossil fuels that are unabated by measures such as carbon capture technology. Officials led by John Kerry, the US climate envoy, admit the exact phrasing may have to be “creative” to gain the consensus of nearly 200 countries, which include other major oil producers such as Russia and Saudi Arabia.

“A US priority will be how to catalyze action to keep to 1.5C, and there are going to be lots of conversations with countries to phrase that in a way that makes the most sense,” said Nate Hultman, a former aide to Kerry, now an expert in climate policy at the University of Maryland. “But we have a dynamic that feels awkward, of how to reconcile the world we are living in, that’s heavily fossil fuel-driven, with the vision of a clean, non-emitting world. That’s the tension.”
Even if such a phaseout declaration is made in Dubai, there is little certainty it will be swiftly fulfilled within the voluntary Cop process. A previous agreement to “phase down” coal use, at a Cop meeting in Scotland in 2021, was followed a year later by the UK allowing the creation of a new coalmine. Multiple new coal plants continue to spring up in China, meanwhile, despite Kerry agitating for the country’s coal use to be curbed.
Halting the use of fossil fuels, the primary cause of the climate crisis, has been elusive in three decades of international climate talks, with major producers now planning a major ramp-up even in the face of escalating heatwaves, floods, droughts and other climate change-fueled disasters.
Biden may have provided a popular boost to renewable energy in the US, but displacing a firmly entrenched fossil fuel industry via a carbon tax or other regulations remains a political no-go area, beyond a fee charged for waste emissions of methane, a potent planet-heating gas.
Instead, Biden has been handing out oil and gas drilling leases on public lands at a rate comparable to Donald Trump, with the emissions from 17 large projects permitted by his administration, including the controversial Willow oil complex in Alaska, set to cause more than 3.2bn tonnes of greenhouse gases over their lifetime, a new report by the Center for Biological Diversitycalculated.
“What the Inflation Reduction Act didn’t do in any way disincentivize the use of fossil fuels – it was all carrots and no sticks,” said Kelly Gallagher, a former climate adviser to Barack Obama’s administration and now interim dean at the Fletcher School at Tufts University. “If the US had done this 20 years ago, it would be a great approach to grow clean energy first before reducing fossil fuel production. But we have very little time now.
“What’s difficult is that we are in an election year now and it’s unlikely that President Biden is going to take steps to hasten the decline of fossil fuels in the US.”
For large oil and gas companies, Cop28 does not yet appear to be a death knell. The summit’s president, Sultan Ahmed Al Jaber, chief executive of Adnoc, the national oil company of the United Arab Emirates, has talked enthusiastically about working with industry to phase down emissions, rather than scrap the central business model of oil and gas extraction itself.
“My hope would be that you start to see more emphasis put on a problem statement of eliminating emissions, versus a problem statement focused on the oil and gas industry per se,” Darren Woods, chief executive of Exxon, saidthis month.",environment

The first transatlantic flight by a commercial airliner fully powered by “sustainable” jet fuel has taken off from London Heathrow.
Tuesday’s Virgin Atlantic flight, partly funded by the UK government, has been hailed by the aviation industry and ministers as a demonstration of the potential to significantly cut net carbon emissions from flying, although scientists and environmental groups are extremely sceptical.
Airlines have previously flown on a blend of up to 50% of alternative fuels, called sustainable aviation fuels (SAF), and flight VS100 is operating under special dispensation with no paying passengers, using fuel made mostly from tallow and other waste products.

Can UK’s ‘jet zero’ hopes take off with a plane fuelled by used cooking oil?

One of those onboard, the transport secretary, Mark Harper, said: “Today’s 100% SAF-powered flight shows how we can decarbonise transport both now and in the future, cutting lifecycle emissions by 70% and inspiring the next generation of solutions.”
Rishi Sunak said the flight was “a major milestone towards making air travel more environmentally friendly and decarbonising our skies”.
Virgin Atlantic said the flight to New York would show that SAF was a safe replacement for normal kerosene jet fuel. The Virgin Atlantic founder and president, Sir Richard Branson, also onboard, said: “The world will always assume something can’t be done, until you do it.”
Airlines see SAF as a critical route to cutting net emissions, because it can be used in existing planes. However, the availability of the fuel now is less than one-thousandth of the total volume of jet fuel used worldwide.
Shai Weiss, the Virgin Atlantic chief executive, said SAF was “the only viable solution for decarbonising long-haul aviation. It’s taken radical collaboration to get here and we’re proud to have reached this important milestone, but we need to push further.
“There’s simply not enough SAF and it’s clear that in order to reach production at scale, we need to see significantly more investment. This will only happen when regulatory certainty and price support mechanisms, backed by government, are in place. Flight 100 proves that if you make it, we’ll fly it.”
Harper said the government would “continue to support the UK’s emerging SAF industry as it creates jobs, grows the economy and gets us to ‘jet zero’”.
Five commercial plants to produce SAF in the UK are due to be under construction by 2025. The fuel used on Tuesday was imported from the US and EU.
The flight comes after a year of testing with the engine maker Rolls-Royceand other industry partners. Scientists onboard VS100 will assess the flight’s non-carbon emissions, including contrails and particulates, whose effect on global warming is not fully understood but is believed to be significant.
Campaigners said the government and airlines were making misleading claims for the flight – particularly a Department for Transport announcement that SAFs would “make guilt-free flying a reality”.
Cait Hewitt, the policy director of the Aviation Environment Federation, said: “The idea that this flight somehow gets us closer to guilt-free flying is a joke.”

She said SAF production would be very hard to scale up sustainably, adding: “Hopefully, we’ll have better technological solutions in future but, for now, the only way to cut CO2 from aviation is to fly less.”

That is the equivalent of a city the size of Aberdeen.
This is the conclusion of new analysis of a practice generating pollution in our own backyard - that suggests how it could be fixed - which has been shared exclusively with Sky News.
""It's a huge waste of gas, basically,"" said Liam Hardy from think tank Green Alliance, which conducted the research.
""Especially in the middle of a cost of living crisis, it's particularly upsetting and disappointing that we're wasting that gas, and we're polluting the atmosphere at the same time.""
ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW THIS ADVERT
Green Alliance says this ""waste"" can be stopped by 2025 by bringing forward a ban on practices known as venting and flaring.
The government says that's not possible. The industry says it already has a plan.
What is venting and flaring, and why is it bad?
Venting and flaring when oil or gas field operators have extra gas they need to get rid of.
Advertisement
For example, when gas comes up with oil in a platform only designed to capture the oil, or if the gas is too dirty.
The operator either releases the gas as methane directly into the atmosphere, known as venting, or burns it, which is called flaring.
Flaring releases substantial volumes of potent greenhouse gases, including black soot and nitrous oxide.
Venting is even worse for the environment because it releases more methane, a gas that warms the atmosphere at least 30 times more than carbon dioxide.
It is happening all around the world.
That's why methane is one of the key issues on the negotiating table at the COP28 climate talks, kicking off in Dubai next week.
A lot of this methane is the same as that burning in our boilers, and so should be captured and used to heat homes, Green Alliance said.
The International Energy Agency calls it an ""extraordinary waste of money"" because companies could sell the gas.
How bad is venting and flaring in UK territory?
There are currently 284 UK-licenced offshore fields in production in the North Sea, according to the regulator, the North Sea Transition Authority (NSTA).
The think tank has identified the 40 worst offending for venting and flaring.
Green Alliance estimates that venting alone accounts for around 2.5% of UK methane emissions.
What can be done?
The government is banning venting and flaring from 2030 - there will be exceptions for emergencies.
Green Alliance says that can be brought forward to 2025, as did the net-zero review earlier this year, and the government's climate advisers, the CCC.
Doing so would mean those sites that are producing ""negligible"" oil or gas but releasing a lot of methane, and are due to shut soon anyway (14 sites shown in red in the map above) would close in 2025 instead.
The gas lost from these sites would be offset by that captured from just 18 of the top 40 sites (in orange) that will likely be producing for some time, so should have the technology added to capture the gas sooner, Green Alliance says.
This is what would prevent 5.2 billion cubic feet of gas being released into the air every year - and supply 140,000 homes with energy. These figures could rise if applied to all sites, not just those in the top 40.
""We can actually grow the UK's domestic production of gas by ending routine venting and flaring,"" Green Alliance said.
Other sites, such as those that are producing a lot of oil and gas still but are due to close soon (shown in yellow), could qualify for an exemption.

Is a 2025 ban realistic?
Grant Allen, professor of atmospheric physics at Manchester University, said: ""Reducing emissions from flaring and venting is one of the potential climate quick wins.
""With good monitoring, industrial practice, and only small changes in industrial technology, it is possible to greatly reduce unnecessary emissions from flaring and venting.""
The International Energy Agency has said various technology exists to capture and potentially sell the gas instead.
In some cases it will cost, requiring extra support or legislation from governments, in others it can make money.
Professor Stuart Haszeldine from Edinburgh University said the government may have to tweak some financial levers to make the changes more economical for operators.
But ""[retrofitting] those installations would be difficult within the timeframe that we're looking at"", said Mark Wilson from industry body Offshore Energies UK. It could also mean having to turn sites off.

Mr Wilson said every site already had a ""robust"" plan to reduce all emissions, and had already cut methane emissions by 45% and flaring by 11%.
""We've already made huge strides to reduce emissions... We've done that because we're doing it in a programmed, well-thought-out way,"" he added.

A Department for Energy Security and Net Zero spokesperson said the UK adopted ""early and ambitious measures to tackle methane emissions"", leading to significant falls already.
""We do recognise the urgency to go further, which is why we are committed to banning routine venting and flaring by 2030.""
They said accelerating the targets would ""lead to an early end of production"" from some sites and further reliance on imported gas with higher emissions.
Green Alliance said the lost gas would be more than compensated for by that captured from the sites that have technology fitted early.

the_independent,https://www.independent.co.uk/travel/news-and-advice/sustainable-flying-planes-virgin-atlantic-b2454323.html,"The latest aviation innovation is under way. The first transatlantic passenger flight using only sustainable aviation fuel, or SAF, took off from London Heathrow airport, destination New York, shortly before 12 noon on Tuesday 28 November.
The Boeing 787, “Lucy in the Sky”, had to be specially certified by the aviation authorities in the UK, Ireland, Canada and the US, the nations it is flying over. No paying customers were on board – instead, around 100 invited guests made the 3,500-mile journey.
Ahead of departure, Virgin Atlantic’s chief executive, Shai Weiss, told The Independent:“This is a proof-of-concept of what can be done and what should be done.”
But environmentalists dispute some of the claims made for SAF, and say the only real solution to the impact of aviation on the planet is to reduce the amount of flying. These are the key questions and answers.
What’s the big idea?
The aviation industry says that sustainable aviation fuel, or SAF, can reduce overall emissions by 70 per cent – and the aim of this flight is to show that if the world gets to the point where it can make enough of SAF, there would be no need for oil-based fuel.
Unlike any previous transatlantic flight, this one used zero fossil fuel – instead flying mainly on a mix of recycled vegetable oil, animal fat and household waste.
The two Rolls-Royce engines are mainly fuelled by processed waste fats, known as HEFA (hydroprocessed esters and fatty acids). But 12 per cent of plant-based synthetic aromatic kerosene (SAK) is added to provide the necessary mix for the engines to function normally.

(Simon Calder)
So zero emissions?
Far from it. The amount of fuel burnt (about 45 tons) and carbon dioxide generated by the seven-hour Virgin Atlantic Flight 100 is exactly the same as if normal Jet A1 kerosene had been used.
The difference is: over the lifecycle of the fuel, the net amount of greenhouse gases generated is much lower. For example, by converting household waste to SAF, it won’t end up generating methane as landfill.
Another example is with plant-based fuel: while those plants are growing, they absorb CO2 from the atmosphere – and then, when burnt an aircraft engine, they release it back. 
Which, says the aviation industry, is a pretty good example of moving towards net zero. But they are desperate for wider availability of affordable SAF.
Rania Georgoutsakou, managing director of Airlines for Europe, says: “Today’s transatlantic trailblazing trip is an exciting glimpse into the future of flying but if we want to move from it being a one-off stunt to a daily reality, we need action now.
“Across Europe there is enormous airline appetite for sustainable aviation fuels combined with ambitious mandates for SAF use under new EU rules. But we are starting from a low base.
“However, with the right level of government incentives and support we could supercharge supply in Europe – adding 30 sustainable fuel factories across the continent by 2030 – and truly transform our industry.”

Far from it. Anna Hughes, director of Flight Free UK, says: “This relies on the emissions-savings-claims from SAF being accurate. There is no difference in emissions when the fuel is burned; any ‘savings’ come from the life-cycle of the product.
“But converting these to aircraft-grade fuel is very energy-intensive, meaning that on balance, you might as well just use kerosene.”
Campaigners also say that growing crops specifically to be converted to fuel can damage biodiversity and cause deforestation – making it worse than using fossil fuels. 
The Royal Society calculates that the energy crops considered – rapeseed, miscanthus, and poplar wood – would require more than 50 per cent of the UK’s available agricultural land to replace aviation fuel.
The UK government is keen to champion the processing of waste into SAF, saying: “Repurposing waste products into jet fuel to cut emissions provides the most immediate solution to help decarbonise our skies.”
But the Royal Society says: “‘Waste’ feedstocks including sewage, solid municipal waste, or forestry residues, could contribute towards net zero fuel demand, but there is competition from established markets for these feedstocks and significant investment in fuel production and collection infrastructure is required.”
In terms of inedible animal fat, T&E (Transport and Environment), Europe’s leading NGO campaigning for cleaner transport, calculates: “A flight from Paris to New York needs 8,800 dead pigs.”

Should we simply fly less?
Anna Hughes of Flight Free UK thinks so. She fears some passengers may be soothed into believing there is a simple and painless solution to the impact of aviation on the planet.
“This is a seminal moment for the industry and government, allowing them to pretend that we can continue to fly as much as we like with no harm to the environment.
“The reality is that we still haven’t worked out how to meaningfully reduce the environmental harms of flying, so the short-term answer must be that we need to do it a lot less.
“While it sounds promising that a flight can be fuelled with 100 per cent SAF, we are many years away from seeing so-called ‘sustainable’ fuels in widespread use. The reality is that in order to reliably bring down flight emissions, we need to be flying less, which is certainly not what the industry wants to hear.”
Helen Coffey, the travel editor of The Independent, agrees: “The branding of this type of fuel has been, I’ll admit, extremely clever. The seductive words ‘sustainable aviation fuels’ suggest they produce fewer emissions than regular jet fuel when the plane is airborne; this simply isn’t the case.”
But Virgin Atlantic’s boss, Shai Weiss, told The Independent: “Flying is something that island nations need. We need to do business, we need to do science, we need to visit friends and family.
“To think that we can magic up elimination of flying, I think is naive to an extreme.”
Earlier this year, the UK government made domestic air travel significantly more attractive by halving Air Passenger Duty.

When will passengers fly routinely in SAF-powered planes?
They are already – but using only a fraction of SAF alongside normal fuel. And that highlights the real problem: SAF is in very short supply worldwide, and consequently costs a fortune. 
The aviation industry says governments must come to the rescue, and support this nascent industry – to enable the goal of net zero aviation in 2050 to be achieved.
What about other solutions?
Electric aviation using batteries or hydrogen is zero emission. But the Transport Select Committee says: “Electric batteries are unlikely to become small or light enough to make them suitable for anything beyond short-haul flights.
“Hydrogen is likely to demand large amounts of storage space and is highly flammable.”",environment
cnn,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/07/31/world/cities-nature-call-to-earth-day-our-shared-home-c2e-spc-intl/index.html,"CNN — 
With most of the world’s population residing in cities, it’s often challenging to understand how our actions affect remote and wild regions. For Call to Earth Day 2023, we will focus on the vital link between urban areas and wilderness, and shed light on the impact cities have on distant natural spaces.
This year’s Call to Earth Day will take place on Wednesday, November 28, with the theme “Our Shared Home.” From the inner city to the suburbs, the plains, the mountains, the jungle, and beyond, we must protect and nurture our connected ecosystems.
Here, we explore how our cities can be part of the great tapestry of habitats on Earth.
Keeping cities clean
Pollution remains a significant challenge in city centers. Urban areas produce roughly 78% of carbon emissions worldwide and an estimated 60% of plastic waste found in the ocean begins its journey in a city, but innovative solutions to combat pollution can be found across the planet.
One example comes from Varanasi, a city on the Ganges, India’s holiest river. Here, discarded temple flowers clog up the waterways, so a local initiative started collecting the floral waste and transforming it into sustainable products.

Flowers discarded in the River Ganges during religious festivals are a source of pollution.

By repurposing these blooms, the project reduces river pollution and waste while providing employment opportunities for local people who process the waste flowers to create carbon-free incense and eco-friendly artificial leather.
This effort highlights how cultural practice and environmental consciousness can go hand in hand.
Creating spaces for wildlife
As urbanization continues to accelerate, so does the loss of biodiversity – a predicted 11 to 33 million hectares of natural habitat will be lost by 2100 as a result of urban development. But around the world people are working to carve out safe havens for animals among the high-rises and intersections.

The concrete jungle of Hong Kong is home to yellow-crested cockatoos, which, despite not being native to the area, are thriving thanks to safe nesting spaces created in an effort to conserve the critically endangered species. The feral flock is thought to represent around 10% of the remaining population, showing how cities can be safe spaces for wildlife.
Across the globe, cities are making strides to provide urban habitats for wildlife, such as the introduction of floating ecosystems to city waterways, offering refuge to urban aquatic species.
As cities grow, it becomes crucial to incorporate green spaces to maintain ecological balance and protect biodiversity.
Letting animals move
Through the sprawl of cities, animals increasingly encounter challenges in navigating their once-open territories. Land-crossing migratory routes and even birds’ flight pathsare under threat.
A 2021 report on the disruption of wild animal migratory patterns found that a third of the animals studied had changed their normal migration route due to disturbance caused by human activities, such as hunting, agriculture, and logging.

Wildlife bridges, tunnels, and corridors – such as those constructed in Canada’s Banff National Park – enable animals to migrate safely.
These initiatives foster coexistence between humans and wildlife, ensuring animals can roam freely without risking their lives on busy roads.
Nature-friendly buildings
As populations continue to rise, cities will continue to grow and eat into natural landscapes, but we can help combat the damage by making the buildings greener.
Nature-friendly buildings aim to harmonize with the environment rather than imposing on it. Such structures incorporate green roofs, vertical gardens, and energy-efficient designs, reducing their carbon footprint.

Urban structures don't have to be concrete towers. ACROS Fukuoka Prefectural International Hall in Fukuoka, Japan, is an example of a green building in the heart of the city.

From carbon-neutral office buildings to penthouses cloaked in leafy plants, cities around the planet are already adopting climate-friendly constructions. Some cities are even offering incentives to developers who integrate nature-friendly features, encouraging a more sustainable urban landscape.
By blending the urban and natural worlds, these buildings can become a crucial part of the solution to create greener cities for future generations.
Coexisting
Keeping cities clean through imaginative pollution solutions, creating spaces for wildlife, facilitating animal movement, and constructing nature-friendly buildings can mean a healthier and more sustainable coexistence between humans and the natural world.
These positive changes not only benefit local ecosystems and biodiversity but also enhance the health and quality of life for city dwellers.",environment

Tomato growers in central India have been increasingly worried about the volatility that extreme weather events have brought to the region. For much of the area, the last decade has been punctuated by severe droughts that led to significant crop loss, impacting the livelihoods of local farmers.
On the other side of the world, Silicon Valley startup ClimateAi is developing an artificial intelligence platform to evaluate how vulnerable crops are to warming temperatures over the next two decades. The tool uses data on the climate, water and soil of a particular location to measure how viable the landscape will be for growing in the coming years.
Maharashtra, India, was one of its first case studies in 2021. Farmers could go into the ClimateAi app and input what seed they were growing and where they wanted to plant it.
With that data, ClimateAi ran simulations and found that extreme heat and drought would lead to an approximately 30% decrease in tomato output in the region over the next two decades. It warned growers that they should change their strategy.
The results proved pivotal — tomato producers adjusted their business plans by switching to more climate-resilient seed varieties and shifting the times they plant tomato seeds. Finding new growing locations usually takes a while for farmers affected by climate change, but “now it can happen in a matter of minutes, and it also saves them a lot of cost,” according to Himanshu Gupta, who grew up in India and is the CEO and co-founder of ClimateAi.
“The way we think about AI is it’s a time and effectiveness multiplier to the solutions for climate change,” Gupta told CNN.
Better assessing future risks for farming is just one of the ways artificial intelligencetechnologies are being used to address the climate crisis.
AI first crashed into the public consciousness this year thanks to popular, consumer-facing AI tools like ChatGPT, and experts say the technology is set to revolutionize countless industries. But climate researchers have for years been thinking about how AI — computer programs that can rapidly analyze enormous amounts of data and complete complex tasks in ways similar to how a human might — could help them better understand and address the changing climate.

Everything you need to know about AI but were too afraid to ask
Now, experts say AI is poised to accelerate everything from reducing pollution to improving weather models.
“Efficiencies is one thing that AI is very good at, optimizing decisions, optimizing resources,” said Fengqi You, chair professor at Cornell University’s engineering school. “It’s a system that has very strong predictive capabilities that could be tremendously helpful in many domains, ranging from (understanding) small-scale molecules … to broader climate systems to help us fight climate change.”
With the breakneck pace at which the planet has been warming, accelerating the speed at which the world deploys and implements solutions is crucial. But for all of AI’s promise, the infrastructure that supports the technology — data centers filled with rows of powerful, energy-sucking computers — could itself be a strain on the environment. Experts say software engineers must work closely with climate scientists to find a balance.
“It’s definitely something that has to be considered as this trade-off,” said Kara Lamb, an associate research scientist at Columbia University’s earth and environmental engineering department. Still, “the positives outweigh the negatives in terms of applying it to these types of approaches.”

Technology that speeds up discovery
Artificial intelligence is a broad term that refers to various digital tools trained to perform a wide range of complex tasks that might previously have required input from an actual person. Generally, what these technologies have in common is their ability to rapidly process and find connections among vast amounts of disparate data.
This makes AI particularly good at things like forecasting and running simulations. And unlike traditional computer programs, AI tools can typically continue learning over time as new data is available or as the systems receive new feedback about the quality of their outputs.
While scientific discovery used to be reliant on humans’ ability to gather, observe and analyze evidence, computers can now process large datasets, identify patterns and run digital experiments in a fraction of the time that human researchers would need.

‘An agenda to control you’: How climate solutions got sucked into a fevered culture war
“For the climate models, fundamentally we’re trying to solve these equations … how these atmosphere models are interacting, and it takes a long time to solve,” You said. Similarly, research on new energy conduction materials, like those for solar panels, could require countless hours of testing that can now be sped up using AI.
“In the past, people used to need trial and error, we’d need … researchers working every day and night,” You said. “Now, because of AI, which doesn’t need to sleep, it just needs electric power, it could keep working 24/7 and it can become very helpful in accelerating discovery.”
AI probably won’t replace the need for humans in the climate change fight. But it could make their work faster and more effective.
Researchers seeking to restore coastlines by replanting seagrass, for example, are using AI to model the best locations to target those replanting efforts, said Dan Keeler, chief communication officer at impact investing firm Newday, which is involved in charitable efforts to support the coastal restoration.
An AI algorithm trained to address the issue could take into consideration everything from toxins in the water or disruptive shipping routes to how replanting efforts could impact nearby sea life or even coastal tourism.
“It’s very difficult to put all those together into a single model with conventional methods, but AI actually makes that much more possible,” Keeler said.
AI ‘doing the dirty work’ in climate research
The Arctic is warming four times faster than the rest of the planet, scientists have found. Rising temperatures are melting sea ice, thawing permafrost and igniting wildfires in what should be one of the coldest regions on Earth.
Climate experts have said what happens in the Arctic is a bellwether for the rest of the world. But climate models – which scientists use to predict long-term change – are not capturing how fast it’s warming.

They went hunting for fossil fuels. What they found could help save the world
With the help of AI, Anna Liljedahl, a scientist at the Woodwell Climate Research Center, can make permafrost forecasts on a seasonal timescale, instead of on the typical 100-year timescale, giving her and other researchers a better picture of how fast the Arctic is melting.
“AI is doing the dirty work,” Liljedahl told CNN. “But AI is not perfect, so we see it as a first tool, and then the human will come in after and really check and make sure that things make sense and explore the things that AI suggested.”
The technology can also be used for solutions. A 2019 Google DeepMind project trained an AI model on weather forecasts and historical wind turbine data to predict the availability of wind power, helping to increase the value of the renewable energy source for wind farmers. AI can also help predict when and where energy demand is going to be highest, allowing grid operators to “make sure they have power online, ready to supply demand, and also that they don’t have power that’s just being produced and it’s going to be consumed, because that’s obviously a tremendous waste,” said Keeler.

ClimateAi’s Gupta said the problem is figuring out how to integrate renewable capacity into the existing fossil fuel-dominated grid. AI can identify in real-time which renewable energy sources are available in the areas where consumers want it — optimizing consumer demand and supply for renewables.
Elsewhere, AI is also being used to research materials that could effectively recapture carbon from the atmosphere and to model and forecast major floods to help local government agencies better prepare for and react to potential emergencies.
The Cool Down, a media company aiming to help consumers better understand the climate crisis and potential solutions, is set to launch an AI tool early next year that will answer user questions about how to live a more sustainable lifestyle, according to Anna Robertson, co-founder and head of content and partnerships. The tool will use data from its site about what kinds of climate information consumers are most curious about to direct users to information, including answering questions like, “What can I do with my old jeans?” or “I want to switch my laundry detergent, where should I start?”
“Part of the problem is that the issue itself has become so overwhelming and mostly dominated by doom and gloom and not the solutions we have at our fingertips,” Robertson told CNN. “We want to make it easier for people to make better choices.”
Finding the right balance
There’s a downside to all this computational power: Running artificial intelligence models is energy-intensive, and many data centers are operated in areas that are still heavily reliant on fossil fuels, Cornell’s You said. Data centers also typically require water for cooling — a dwindling resource in some places where this computing is being done, including the American West.
For now, the amount of energy used to power AI is relatively small compared to what’s consumed by transportation or buildings. “But this is going to grow very fast, and we do need to be very careful at this moment before it grows exponentially,” You said.
An October study from Dutch researcher Alex de Vries estimated that the “worst-case scenario” suggests Google’s AI systems could eventually consume as much electricity as the country of Ireland each year, assuming a full-scale adoption of AI in their current hardware and software. Developers should be advised “not only to focus on optimizing AI, but also to critically consider the necessity of using AI in the first place, as it is unlikely that all applications will benefit from AI or that the benefits will always outweigh the costs,” the study concludes.

Data center operators like Google are already thinking about how to reduce the resources needed to power the computing behind their AI models.

Some data center operators are already beginning to address these concerns.
Amazon Web Services, the online shopping giant’s cloud computing arm, has pledged to be “water positive” by 2030, meaning the company will “return more water to the communities in which we have our data center infrastructure than we take,” CEO Adam Selipsky told CNN in an October interview.
In Oregon, for example, where drought has tightened its grip in recent years, AWS is providing the spent water used for cooling its data centers to local farmers for irrigation at no cost.
The companies building and running data centers to carry out AI workloads can also think about strategically placing them in areas where they might require fewer natural resources to operate, You said. If data centers are built in colder parts of the world, for example, less water will be needed for cooling; Scandanavia has emerged as a popular location for data centers, also bolstered by its relatively robust availability of renewable energy sources.

This controversial climate solution could be exactly what the planet needs. Or it could be a colossal disaster
Lawmakers in the United States and abroad — who have in recent months increasingly turned their attention to developing guardrails for AI — should consider both the technology’s potential benefits in fighting climate change and its environmental impact when developing regulations, You added.
“Regulators, decision makers, policymakers really need to think about this when they are looking at the growth of [the AI] industry,” You said. “The growth of the industry is not only about the software, tools and so on, but also how they operate these data centers.”
Tech experts also caution that AI must be made affordable and accessible for low-income nations, particularly those in the Global South that are on the frontlines of the climate crisis yet contribute the least to global pollution, something Gupta hopes to address as he expands ClimateAi’s resources.
“When it comes to AI being applied to climate change,” said Gupta, “I think we are just scratching the surface of the potential that exists both in terms of the impact it could create for businesses, but also the impact it could create at the humanity level.”

The following is an excerpt from “This week, your wallet,” an audio program produced by CNBC’s Personal Finance team. Listen to the latest episode here. [Editor’s note: Audio clip begins at the 2:33 minute mark.]
Climate change has been described as a ticking time bomb, the threats of which extend beyond ecosystems and biodiversity to big financial impacts on households and the U.S. economy.

Those financial costs are largely the result of extreme weather events.
The White House issued a report last week — the Fifth National Climate Assessment, issued every four to five years by the federal government — warning that heat waves, heavy rains, drought, hurricanes, floods and wildfires “are becoming more frequent and/or severe,” with a “cascade of effects” in all areas of the U.S.

“It’s no longer just a problem for Florida, or just a problem for Louisiana and New Orleans,” said Andrew Rumbach, senior fellow and co-lead of the climate and communities program at the Urban Institute. “More and more people are experiencing these extreme events and they carry all kinds of different costs, both direct and indirect, for those families.”
Here’s what to know, according to Rumbach and David Pogue, host of the podcast “Unsung Science” and author of “How to Prepare for Climate Change: A Practical Guide to Surviving the Chaos.” Both experts were interviewed by CNBC during a recent discussion about climate change and its impact on personal finance.
We already feel the impact — and it’s likely to worsen

Weather-related disasters cost the U.S. at least $150 billion a year, according to the White House report, which calls that estimate “conservative.”

The U.S. now experiences a billion-dollar disaster every three weeks, on average; during the 1980s, that happened every four months, the report notes.

The economic toll — due to such things as water stress, agricultural loss, tourism impacts, falling real estate value, and property and infrastructure damage — is expected to grow.
“Over time, each incremental increase in climate change is going to up the economic cost bit by bit,” Rumbach said.
Every additional degree of global warming translates to “increasingly adverse consequences,” the White House report said. For example, warming by 2°F is projected to more than double the economic harm from 1°F of warming, it said.
The effects can be ‘weird and unpredictable’

Climate change’s impacts can be “weird and unpredictable,” Pogue said.
“I prefer the term ‘global weirding,’ because warming is only just part of it,” he said.

For example, more than 3 million U.S. adults reported being displaced from their home by an extreme weather event just within the past year, Rumbach said, citing data from the U.S. Census Bureau’s Household Pulse Survey.
In other words, 1 in 70 adults were displaced because of events such as hurricanes, floods and fires, according to an Urban Institute report. Many of them were away from their homes for less than a month, but others were away for at least six months.
Even absent property damage, an evacuation leads to transportation costs, hotel costs, and time away from work, which may disrupt pay and workplace benefits, Rumbach said.  
“All those costs really add up,” he said.

Further, for every additional “hot day” per year, especially in Western states, the prevalence of workplace injuries increases by 5% to 15%, Rumbach said, citing peer-reviewed scientific analyses. There’s also $10,000 in additional emergency room costs per 100,000 people, especially among the elderly, he said.
Plus, for every 1% decline in crop yields, there’s an estimated 0.1% out-migration of the population — a significant impact both for places losing people and for those receiving them, Rumbach said.
Declining agricultural output may fuel higher food prices, experts said, and greater property damage will likely fuel higher insurance rates.
There are ways consumers can prepare

Americans may frequently hear about ways to reduce their carbon footprint. But there are also steps they can take to prepare for the worsening effects of climate change.
“Governments and corporations have been adapting for a long time: That’s why they build sea walls, and Starbucks is finding new mountains to grow coffee on,” Pogue said. “But nobody ever talks about the little guy.”
The first thing to do, Pogue said: Look at your homeowners or renters insurance policy.
“You probably bought it years ago, trying to make it as cheap as possible,” he said. “But things have changed, and I think a lot of people are stunned to find out that homeowner’s insurance does not cover flooding. It just doesn’t.”
	
	It’s no longer just a problem for Florida, or just a problem for Louisiana and New Orleans.
	Andrew Rumbach
	SENIOR FELLOW AT THE URBAN INSTITUTE
Those with renters or homeowners insurance should make sure they’re not underinsured, Rumbach said.
Prospective homebuyers can consult tools to choose homes in areas with reduced climate risk, he added. For example, Redfin offers climate risk assessments based on geography, he said.
There are also potential ways for investors to bolster their investment portfolio and have a positive impact on the environment, Pogue said.
Supporting an industry or company that’s “green” is “in effect helping everyone,” he said.
The best approach wouldn’t be to invest broadly in solar and wind companies, for example — those are commodities that keep getting cheaper, Pogue said.
Instead, it may involve investing in utility companies that get all their electricity from renewable energy sources, Pogue said. Thirty-eight states now have mandates about getting a certain amount of power from renewable energy, he added.
Investing in the electric-vehicle revolution may include buying into companies that produce electric car batteries or those that mine lithium, a key component in electric car batteries, for example, he said.",environment

Leigh C. knew that the homeowners insurance on her home in Black Forest, Colorado, an area just northeast of Colorado Springs, would be renewing soon. But when she opened her new bill, she thought she had misread the number. “I called them to see if that was a mistake,” she told CNBC Select.

Looking at the itemized numbers, Leigh found that her annual property insurance premium renewal jumped 124% from $3,767 to $8,361. Even though she volunteers for United Policyholders, a nonprofit that advocates for homeowners insurance policyholders after major disasters, Leigh had trouble believing her eyes. “I was like, oh, my gosh, is that three or an eight?,” she says.

These increases in homeowners insurance premiums aren’t uncommon. According to data from online insurance marketplace Policygenius, premiums rose by an average of 21% between May 2022 and May 2023. To put that percentage in terms of dollars and cents, the average home in Arizona, which cost $826 to insure in 2022, requires $1,038 in 2023 — a jump of 26%. 

And homeowners insurance isn’t just getting more expensive — in some parts of the country, it’s also harder to find, as major providers change where they’re willing to underwrite policies. In late May 2023 State Farm General Insurance Company (State Farm’s provider of homeowners insurance in California and the largest writer of homeowners insurance policies in the state by direct premiums in 2022) announced it would “cease accepting new applications including all business and personal lines property and casualty insurance” according to a press release. And in Louisiana, 22 insurers have either gone insolvent or stated that they would be withdrawing from the homeowners insurance market in the past three years, according to NOLA.com.

A factor behind both the increased costs and decreased availability of homeowners insurance is climate change. With home affordability at its lowest level in decades, the climbing costs of homeowners insurance is one more hurdle potential homebuyers struggle to clear. CNBC Select takes a look at how climate change is exacerbating the problem, and what you can do to mitigate the damage — at least to your finances.

How a changing climate contributes to higher homeowners insurance costs

While climate change isn’t solely responsible for rising homeowners insurance premiums (higher construction costs and other factors also play a role), it’s a major contributor — mainly because of the increased likelihood of natural disasters.

In its press release, State Farm specifically cited “rapidly growing catastrophe exposure” as one of the reasons it would no longer accept new applications for property insurance. Government officials have also noted the tie between homeowners insurance availability and climate change. Ohio Senator Sherrod Brown (D), who chairs the Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs stated in September that costs in the reinsurance market, where insurers spread their risk over larger pools, have been driven “in part by frequent and more severe natural disasters.” US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen also noted earlier in 2023 that “there is growing evidence that these trends in physical risks have led to a decline in the availability and affordability of insurance in certain areas.”

The specific disasters driving up homeowners insurance premiums look different depending on where you are in the country. In the southeast, for example, Hurricane Idalia this August caused about $2.5 billion of damage in 2023 according to NOAA. And the west remains a tinderbox — in California alone, more than 275,000 acres of wildfires have burned as of September 2023.  

Even those not in disaster-prone areas are feeling the pinch. One reason is the reinsurance market — or the cost of insurance bought by insurance companies to spread risk over a larger pool. Events all over the world, from flooding in Greece to wildfires in Hawaii and beyond, can impact the rates offered by reinsurers. That can raise the cost of business for insurance companies, who then pass that cost onto homeowners. 

In the southeast, hurricane damage is getting stronger each season, and premiums are rising

In the southeastern US, warmer water is contributing to more frequent and damaging hurricanes. The U.S. Geological Survey states that “with increasing global surface temperatures the possibility of more droughts and increased intensity of storms will likely occur.” And as stronger and more frequent storms batter America’s southeast, it becomes harder for homeowners to bounce back.

Louisiana insurance commissioner James Donelon, who is ending his tenure in office in 2023 after having held the position since 2006, believes that the state’s insurance market today compares to the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina. “For 15 years, our market was stable and competitive,” he says. “But then in 2020, the second-most powerful storm to ever hit Louisiana made landfall in our Southwest corner, Hurricane Laura.” The hurricane hit Cameron, Louisiana with sustained winds of 150 miles per hour as a category four hurricane, according to the National Weather Service. 

A year and two days later, Hurricane Ida made landfall in Port Fourchon, a more populated area about 90 miles south of New Orleans. By the time Hurricane Ian hit Florida in 2022, causing between $50 billion and $65 billion of damage, Louisiana was already struggling with its insurance market. “That was not exactly as devastating to our market as if it had hit Louisiana,” Donelon said. “But it’s certainly impacted us.” 

Other factors, including roofing scams in Florida and litigation issues, were also plaguing the southeast’s insurance industry. But climate change is one piece contributing to the larger puzzle.  

“I’d have to be blind and dumb to claim that it’s not a major factor,” Donelon said. 

The average annual homeowners insurance premium in Florida is 35% higher in May 2023 than it was in May 2022 according to a Policygenius report, and Louisiana prices surged 27% in the same time frame.  

In the west, fires are becoming more damaging and common  

In Black Forest, Leigh and her family have hit the 10-year mark since the 2013 Black Forest Fire. Estimates show that the fire was, at the time, the second most costly fire in the state’s history, causing about $420 million in damages. It was second place to another Colorado Springs-area fire that took place in 2012, the Waldo Canyon Fire, which cost about $453 million. 

Since these two fires in 2013 and 2012, respectively, the Rocky Mountain Insurance Information Association estimates that two more fires have caused significantly more damage in the state — an October 2020 wildfire in Grand County, Colorado cost $543 million in damages, and a 2021 fire in Boulder County cost about $2 billion in damage.  

California, however, has seen some of the costliest wildfire damage of all time, including the $10 billion Camp Fire in 2018 and the 2017 Tubbs Fire, which incurred about $8.7 billion in damages.  

While the initial causes for these fires vary, climate change is creating more favorable conditions for them to catch and spread. A 2016 report from the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States shows that climate change is responsible for over half of the documented increases in fuel aridity since the 1970s. And, these changes have doubled the forest fire burned areas since 1984. 

It’s making homeowners insurance more expensive. And, it’s making it less available — in 2021, about 241,000 California households faced insurer-initiated non-renewals and cancellations for homeowners and dwelling fire policies according to the California Department of Insurance.  

For Leigh and her family in Colorado, mitigating fire risk has become paramount. Creating defensible spaces by clearing brush and ignitable materials and using non-combustible building materials are common mitigation techniques, according to the Federal Emergency Management Agency. “We’ve done a lot of mitigation,” she says. “But is it enough?”  

Homeowners need to think about their insurance coverage more than ever before 

With climate change driving up the cost of homeownership for many Americans, homeowners need to do whatever they can to make sure they’re getting the best insurance coverage for the cheapest price.

Shopping around for insurance (when you have a choice of providers) can help you find a good deal, but there’s more you can do to save money and stay protected. Several things to consider when buying homeowners insurance include:  

Read your policy carefully to understand what it does and doesn’t cover. For those in high-risk areas, this is especially important. Some last-resort homeowners insurance options cover less than a standard homeowners insurance policy, including California’s FAIR plan which doesn’t cover water damage, theft and personal liability. While these coverages can be purchased separately, they’re not included as they would be on a standard homeowner’s insurance policy. Reading your policy before you need coverage can help you be sure of the resources you have available if a situation arises.  
Consider additional coverage. A changing climate is increasing the likelihood of natural disasters. Even if you’ve felt confident up until now that you wouldn’t have to deal with flooding or a wildfire, it’s worth reconsidering and possibly adjusting your insurance coverage to include a flood insurance policy, for example.
Understand your deductibles and make sure you can comfortably cover them. A deductible is the amount a homeowner is responsible for covering before homeowners insurance kicks in during a claim. Understand what they are on the policy, noting any separate deductibles that may apply to specific disasters (such as hurricanes). Typically, the higher your policy’s deductible the lower your premium payments, but be careful — if you don’t have enough money to cover up to the deductible, you’ll face financial hardship when you need to make a claim.
Create a home inventory. By documenting the items in your home and their value, you can ensure you have the right amount of coverage. If faced with a disaster, it could also help replace those items. Creating a video walkthrough of your home can help if you need to replace items or submit a homeowners insurance claim.  
Natural disasters are creating challenges in the homeowners insurance market  

While the annual cost of homeowners insurance may pale in comparison to some of the other expenses of having a home, rising premium costs have changed the calculus for many homeowners.

Some of them are considering forgoing their insurance coverage altogether — a choice that could spell financial ruin for those hit hard by a disaster who can’t pay for repairs out of pocket. Others have been forced to take on expensive policies as they’ve seen their choice of providers dwindle.

In Louisiana, Donelon says that Louisiana Citizens, the state’s insurer of last resort — which offers homeowners insurance for applicants who cannot obtain coverage through the regular insurance market — has grown in recent years, from 35,000 policies to 130,000 policies since Hurricane Laura in 2020. State law mandates that Louisiana Citizens charge more for its policies than what’s on the private market, and Donelon speculates this is putting many homeowners in an untenable position. “Thousands of those 130,000 can’t afford it,” he says. “I am sure many are either going uninsured or turning in the keys to their lender and giving up their homes.” 

In Colorado, Leigh is weighing her options for homeowners insurance. She is considering a policy with less dwelling coverage than she feels is necessary. “If our house got burned, a total loss, we wouldn’t be able to replace it,” she says. 

“We love Black Forest,” Leigh says. “There are birds and sunshine and Ponderosas and we have a creek that runs through the side of our property. But I don’t know if we can stay here if we have to pay that much for insurance.”

bbc,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-northern-ireland-67547111,"A conservation charity is calling for tighter laws around banned pesticides, following the release of its annual Birdcrime report.
Four peregrine falcons and a red kite were poisoned in Northern Ireland in 2022. 
The RSPB Birdcrime report revealed the birds of prey died after eating bait laced with illegal pesticides.
Since 2009 a total of 13 red kites have been illegally poisoned. 
Two rare white-tailed eagles found dead in County Antrim in 2023 were poisoned.
They consumed bait poisoned with a pesticide only licensed for indoor use, which is often used in raptor incidents.

Two rare white-tailed eagles found dead in 2023 in County Antrim were poisoned
The raptor was persecuted to extinction two centuries ago and a programme of reintroduction has brought them back to the skies in Northern Ireland. 
Poisons amnesty
But there is concern that the poisonings could have an impact on the population recovering to a sustainable level. 
The RSPB's director of operations in Northern Ireland, Gregory Woulahan, has called on the Department of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs to introduce a poisons amnesty for people to anonymously surrender any stockpile of illegal-to-use or out-of-date pesticides. 
""The continued use of banned pesticides in Northern Ireland's countryside is not only a criminal act but it is also dangerous,"" he said.
""The appalling incident at Glenwherry in the Antrim Hills, where two white-tailed eagles were killed after consuming poisoned bait, brought into focus the impact these chemicals can have, not only on birds, but potentially pets, livestock or even people who inadvertently come into contact with them."" 
The charity is supporting another campaign group, the Northern Ireland Raptor Study Group, which it says has gathered more than 40,000 signatures in a petition calling for possession of pesticides containing certain ingredients to be made an offence. 
Dead or injured birds of prey can be reported by the public either online or by calling the police on 101. 
The RSPB has also warned that the continuing bird flu outbreak could mean cases where a criminal act has taken place may be missed, as no diagnostic post-mortem examination is carried out if a dead bird tests positive for the virus.",law

Perpetrators could face up to two years in prison and up to 10 years on the Sex Offenders Register.
They are among new sexual offences under legislation which took effect on Monday.
Changes also include enhanced laws to deal with people who threaten to share private sexual images or impersonate children with the aim of grooming.
The offences are part of the Justice, Sexual Offences and Trafficking Victims Act 2022.

The bill was brought forward by former justice minister and Alliance leader Naomi Long
Also included in the legislation is an expansion of rules to better protect children from those who seek to abuse their position of trust to exploit or abuse them. 
Those responsible for young people in the area of sport or religion now come within scope of the abuse of trust offences.
Det Supt Lindsay Fisher from the Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) welcomed the new legislation and said it sends ""a clear message"" that these behaviours will not be tolerated.
""I want to make it clear that anyone - any gender, any age - can be a victim of these crimes. However, we know from experience that the vast majority of those affected are sadly women and girls, who up until now have not felt able to come forward and report,"" she said.
""Escalating violence against women and girls does not happen in a cultural vacuum. 
""This legislation will go a long way to help address the prevailing sexist attitudes and behaviours in our society that underpin violence, abuse and intimidation against women and girls.""
• Northern Ireland Assembly members backed the bill in March 2022.
The bill was brought forward by former justice minister Naomi Long, who said it would make an ""important contribution"" to combatting abuse and violence.

""He was laughing"": Three women tell the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire about their experience of upskirting
At the time, the Alliance Party leader described the legislation as ""the final piece of the jigsaw"".
On Monday, Ms Long said the move to introduce the legislation followed a public consultation, among other work. 
""A lot of women came forward with issues around upskirting, downblousing and other forms of sex offences that previously hadn't been captured by the law,"" she told BBC Radio 4's Woman's Hour. 
""I thought it was important that we gave those specific recognition, because they form part of a culture within society where women's bodies are treated as though they are essentially public property.""
Ms Long said training for those working in Northern Ireland's Public Prosecution Service, judiciary and police service has been ongoing in preparation for commencement of the new laws. 
But she added: ""The mechanisms that criminals will use to abuse people are constantly evolving, particularly in an online environment. 
""And that's why it's so important we have an assembly here that is able to respond, that's able to deal with it.""

'I don't know if I'll get over it'
One woman who helped to convict her partner after he took and shared explicit images of her without her knowledge or consent contacted BBC News NI to emphasis the devastating impact this crime can have on victims.
Her identity has been withheld to protect her privacy but she said she felt she lost her dignity as a result of the incident and argued that such crimes are not taken seriously enough.
""I got a message online from someone I didn't know. A stranger was telling me that my partner was sending intimate pictures of me to them,"" the woman said. 
""I didn't know what to do think at first. I was very shaky. I didn't know it was a crime. I called 101 and the police told me it was and asked if I wanted to press charges.""
Despite her partner's conviction, she is still troubled by not knowing who has seen the images or how widely they were shared via social media. 
""Mentally I'm gone, I've lost weight, I don't go out very much. It's not easy to get over; I find myself very anxious. I don't know if I'll get over it. Time will tell. 
""I hope this being in the media helps other women, helps people understand that this is a true and serious crime.""

• Upskirting is when someone uses a mobile phone, or mirror, to observe or photograph under a person's clothing without their consent, with the intention of obtaining sexual gratification or cause humiliation, distress or alarm. It became a stand-alone offence in England and Wales in 2019.
• Downblousing is when someone uses a mobile phone, or mirror, to observe or photograph down a person's top without their consent. Law chiefs have called for it to be made illegal in England and Wales
• Cyber-flashing is when someone sends an unsolicited sexual image to a person without their consent

bbc,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-67484101,"Deliveroo cannot be legally compelled to engage with a union representing its riders for the purposes of collective bargaining, judges have ruled.
The decision is the latest in a long-running dispute, which began when a union tried to represent a group of riders over pay and conditions.
The case was previously dismissed by lower courts but an appeal was brought to the Supreme Court.
However, judges at the Supreme Court unanimously dismissed the appeal.
Judge Vivien Rose said Deliveroo riders did not have an ""employment relationship"" with the food courier company and were not entitled to compulsory collective bargaining.
In a judgement, Lady Rose, along with Lord Lloyd-Jones, said multiple factors, including riders being free to decline offers of work and to work for Deliveroo's competitors, were ""fundamentally inconsistent"" with such a relationship.
Collective bargaining is an official process in which trade unions negotiate with employers on behalf of their members.
Deliveroo riders 'are self-employed'
The Independent Workers Union of Great Britain (IWGB), which brought the case, said the ruling was a disappointment.
""As a union we cannot accept that thousands of riders should be working without key protections like the right to collective bargaining,"" it said in a statement, adding it would continue to explore legal avenues.
""Whether reflected in legislation or not, couriers are joining the union in ever bigger numbers and building our collective power to take action and hold companies like Deliveroo to account,"" it added.
The case follows a number of claims brought by workers in the so-called ""gig"" economy in recent years, demanding rights such as holiday pay, the minimum wage and pensions contributions.
In 2017, the IWGB was first refused permission to represent riders on the basis they were not classed as ""workers"" under UK labour law.
It put forward a legal case, but riders were ruled to be self-employed by labour law body the Central Arbitration Committee (CAC).
The union has since been mounting a number of appeals, reaching the Supreme Court.
Part of the case, which was rejected on Tuesday, focused on whether the arrangement between the food courier and its riders fell under the scope of Article 11 of the European Convention on Human Rights - which covers the right to join trade unions.
But judges rejected this argument.
The Supreme Court has said there is nothing in UK legislation to stop riders from forming or joining a union, and nothing to prevent Deliveroo engaging in collective bargaining with it.
But its ruling added: ""The issue is whether Article 11 requires the United Kingdom to go beyond that current position and to enact legislation conferring on Article 11 workers the right to require their reluctant employer to recognise and negotiate with the union of their choice.""
A Deliveroo spokesperson said that the UK had ""repeatedly and at every level"" confirmed that its riders are self-employed.
""This is a positive judgment for Deliveroo riders, who value the flexibility that self-employed work offers,"" the spokesperson added.
However, the IWGB argued: ""Flexibility, including the option for account substitution, is no reason to strip workers of basic entitlements like fair pay and collective bargaining rights.""
Deliveroo said it had agreed a ""voluntary partnership agreement"" with the GMB Union in 2021 which gave the union collective bargaining rights on pay and consultation rights, on benefits and other issues, while still recognising riders as self-employed.",law
the_guardian,https://www.theguardian.com/law/2023/nov/28/barrister-fined-for-giving-salisbury-magistrate-nazi-salute,"A barrister who was found to have raised his hand in a Nazi salute in court has been fined by his professional regulator and handed a reprimand.
Thomas Davidson, who has been a barrister for more than 50 years, was found by the Bar Standards Board (BSB) to have “behaved in a way which was likely to diminish the trust and confidence which the public places in him or in the profession”.
A three-person panel concluded that he committed professional misconduct in breach of the code of conduct of the Bar of England and Wales.
Davidson was fined £250 for his behaviour, which occurred during a hearing at Salisbury magistrates court on 7 February last year, and ordered to pay costs of £1,750.
The BSB has not yet published its full decision, first reported by Legal Futures, but a summary on the board’s website says: “Following the conclusion of a trial during which he had represented a defendant before a bench consisting of three lay magistrates, and after the chairperson raised with him the issue of his having used a German accent during the proceedings and telling him that this conduct had been inappropriate, Mr Davidson looked at the bench and said ‘Jawohl’ at the same time as raising a hand in a Nazi salute, which conduct was seriously offensive and discreditable.”
Jawohl means “yes, indeed” or “yes, sir” and is often associated with the German military. Davidson has 21 days to appeal and the BSB website says his sentence has yet to take effect.
He is listed as a barrister with CHL chambers in north London and at 160 Fleet Street chambers, where he is a “door tenant” – someone who is affiliated with the set but does not conduct business from the chambers’ premises.
The 160 Fleet Street chambers website says Davidson has a specialist criminal practice that also touches on immigration, family and commercial law. It says he is a former crown prosecutor, sat as a fee-paid immigration judge between 1992 and 2016 and has lectured in commercial law for more than 20 years.
Fleet Street Chambers said it was the first it had heard of the matter and declined to comment further. The Guardian also attempted to contact Davidson through CHL chambers.",law
the_guardian,https://www.theguardian.com/media/2023/nov/28/bruce-lehrmann-defamation-trial-brittany-higgins-witness-stand-evidence-ntwnfb,"Brittany Higgins has taken the stand in Bruce Lehrmann’s defamation trial against Network Ten and journalist Lisa Wilkinson at the start of evidence the defence says will be “graphic and distressing”.

Network Ten’s barrister, Matt Collins KC, said Higgins will tell the court about being allegedly sexually assaulted by Lehrmann in senator Linda Reynolds’ office in 2019 after a night when she had consumed at least 12 vodkas and was “more drunk than she had ever been in her life”.

The court heard Higgins weighed 60kg at the time of the alleged rape and an expert will testify that a woman of her size would have likely been five times over the legal limit with a blood alcohol concentration of 0.23% at the time of the alleged rape.

“She will also give evidence about her relationship with Mr Lehrmann in the period before that night, and of conduct after the alleged sexual assault that is consistent with that assault having occurred,” Collins said in his opening of the defence case.

Lehrmann is suing Network Ten and Wilkinson for defamation over an interview with Higgins broadcast on The Project and online which did not name him but alleged she had been raped by a Liberal staffer in 2019.

Lehrmann has denied raping Higgins and pleaded not guilty to a charge of sexual intercourse without consent. His criminal trial was abandoned due to juror misconduct and the second did not proceed due to prosecutors’ fears for Higgins’ mental health.

Earlier, the court heard Seven Network had compensated Lehrmann for two interviews with the Spotlight program by paying for his rental property in Sydney for 12 months.

Lehrmann was asked: “Was it part of that agreement that you were paid for 12 months’ accommodation by Channel Seven?’

Lehrmann replied: “That’s the only part ... that’s what I get.”

The total amount was not disclosed and Lehrmann said he didn’t know how much it was because Seven handled the payment.

“Network Seven organised the accommodation,” Lehrmann said about the payment, which extends to June 2024.


In answer to a question about payment for an interview in May, the Seven Network told Guardian Australia: “7NEWS Spotlight made no payment to Bruce Lehrmann for the interview, however the program assisted with accommodation as part of the filming of the report.”

The court heard that, under the agreement with Seven, the network would have access to relevant documents, film, video, photographs and “items of assistance reasonably requested”.

Lehrmann agreed with that but said he did not give them anything except the interview.

“No, I just gave an interview,” Lehrmann said.

Collins said the defence will show that The Project’s interview with Higgins focused on the handling of the incident by the government and that Lehrmann was not named.

A lip-reading expert will be among a list of 20 witnesses called, including news and current affairs veteran Peter Meakin who was advising Ten.

In her opening, Wilkinson’s barrister, Sue Chrysanthou SC, said her client had been a journalist since 1978 and took her responsibility very seriously. She said Wilkinson asked Higgins on several occasions if she was sure she wanted to go public with her allegation and several senior journalists worked on the program.

“On January 18, 2021, my client received an email from David Sharaz,” Chrysanthou said of how Wilkinson landed the story.

“David Sharaz was an acquaintance of my client from a few years earlier, when he did work experience at the Today show. They remained in contact.”

During a re-examination by his barrister Steve Whybrow, Lehrmann said he believed it was Sharaz who sent him an anonymous email which had the subject “Coming for you”.

“How many people know what you did, and how many did you tell,” the anonymous email said. “How many cameras are there in Parliament House and how many people tracked down the vision?”

Whybrow asked: “With the benefit of hindsight, have you formed any views as to the origins of that email?”

Lehrmann replied: “Yes I have.”

Whybrow then asked: “What’s your view as to the source of that email?”

Lehrmann replied: “I have a view that that was Ms Higgins’ fiance, David Sharaz.”

In a brief five minutes in the witness box, Higgins said when she was studying for a double university degree she began volunteering and then working in politics because she really enjoyed it.

After a stint in state politics in Queensland, she heard about a role opening up in Canberra and she applied for it and worked as a front of house and assistant media adviser for the Coalition government.

Higgins will continue her evidence on Wednesday morning.",law
the_guardian,https://www.theguardian.com/law/2023/nov/28/offenders-indefinite-jail-sentences-terminated-moj,"More than 1,800 offenders in England and Wales who have been released on licence but remain under indefinite threat of recall to jail are to have their sentences terminated.
Imprisonment for public protection (IPP) sentences, which were imposed on 8,711 people, were abolished in 2012 but not retrospectively, leaving people languishing in prison, often for minor offences, and have been described as “the greatest single stain on the justice system”.
Even when released, IPP offenders are on indefinite licence, meaning they can be recalled at any time, often for behaviour that is not criminal, leading to what has been labelled a “recall merry-go-round”.
However, changes announced by the Ministry of Justice (MoJ) on Tuesday mean that for the first time some IPP offenders will be given an end date for their sentence.
Currently their only option to have their sentence terminated is to apply to the Parole Board 10 years after release. The changes, added to the victims and prisoners bill, will reduce that period to three years after release, and even if the Parole Board says no their sentence will automatically terminate after a further two years if they are not recalled to jail in that time.
As the changes will apply retrospectively, the MoJ said sentences would immediately end for about 1,800 offenders on licence in the community once the legislation comes into force. It said a further 800 IPP offenders would become newly eligible for Parole Board consideration by March 2025 and the new legislation would also introduce a presumption that the board should terminate the licence unless it was still required to protect the public.
The justice secretary, Alex Chalk, said: “We are taking decisive action to curtail IPP licence periods to give rehabilitated people the opportunity to move on with their lives, while continuing to make sure the public are protected from the most serious offenders.
“This is a major step towards wiping away the stain of IPP sentences from our justice system, without compromising public protection.”
Despite widespread criticism of IPP sentences – David Blunkett, who introduced them as Labour home secretary, has previously admitted “I got it wrong” – there has been growing frustration among campaigners, prisoners and their relatives about the lack of progress in addressing their legacy.
Last year, in a report that described IPP sentences as “irredeemably flawed” and said they fuelled feelings of hopelessness and despair as well as high levels of self-harm and some suicides among prisoners, the justice select committee called for all IPP prisoners to be resentenced – but this was rejected by the government.
While the changes announced by Chalk, the most significant since IPP sentences were abolished, were broadly welcomed, there was frustration that they would not affect those now stuck behind bars for offences as minor as stealing a mobile phone.
Shirley Debono, the founder of the campaign group IPP Committee in Action, said: “While we acknowledge the proposed changes and recognise that many individuals will welcome the news of the new proposed license reforms, it is essential to highlight that the government appears to be dancing around the IPP problem and avoiding the core solution, which involves resentencing all IPP prisoners – a recommendation proposed by both the justice committee and the UN special rapporteur on torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment.
“It is crucial for the government and the public to keep in mind that, despite these licence reforms, numerous IPP’s remain unreleased.”
Ungripp, a pressure group representing the families of those jailed under IPP rules, said: “Allowing people serving IPP the prospect of a definite end date to their sentence would be a restoration of hope, certainty, clarity and sense.
“However, we are gravely disappointed that no reforms are proposed for people trapped in prison on IPP – some as many as 18 years over tariff. Nobody should do 18 years longer than a judge deemed fair, in a system that time and again has proven itself unable to meet their needs.
“Today is only one step along the road to truly restoring justice, and we hope the justice secretary will consider going a step further to finally put an end to this injustice.”
As of 30 September there were 2,921 IPP prisoners, 1,269 of whom have never been released, with the remaining 1,652 having been recalled to custody. The justice select committee said in its report there were 608 who were at least 10 years over their original minimum tariff, of whom 188 were originally given a minimum sentence of less than two years.",law
cnbc,https://www.cnbc.com/2023/09/29/supreme-court-to-weigh-gop-backed-social-media-censorship-laws.html?&qsearchterm=law,"WASHINGTON — The Supreme Court on Friday waded into the divisive issue of online censorship by agreeing to decide the constitutionality of laws in Florida and Texas that seek to prevent social media companies from banning users for contentious rhetoric.
The laws, backed by Republicans, have been characterized by their supporters as hitting back at alleged censorship of conservative speech by liberal-leaning social media companies, although the Supreme Court’s ruling could have broader impacts.

The court’s ruling, likely to come next year, will land at a time when the influence of social media companies on society is being hotly debated, with Republicans often critical of moderation decisions they they claim stifle conservative voices while Democrats complain that not enough is done to prevent the spread of hateful rhetoric.
Traditionally, social media platforms, as private entities, have broad leeway to make editorial decisions on what user content to allow on their websites or apps, and most apps require people to agree to detailed rules and extensive terms of service in order to continue using them.
Tech companies like Facebook, Twitter and YouTube, represented by trade groups NetChoice and the Computer and Communications Industry Association, known as CCIA, say that both laws infringe upon the free speech rights of companies under the Constitution’s First Amendment by restricting their ability to choose what content they wish to publish on their platforms.
The states argue that they have the authority to regulate social media companies to ensure that users receive equal access to the platforms.
Conservative anger that led to the laws being enacted in 2021 was fueled by the decisions of Twitter, Facebook and others to ban former President Donald Trump after his effort to overturn the 2020 presidential election results ended in his supporters storming the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021.

The laws were enacted before Twitter was taken over last year by billionaire Elon Musk, who has allied himself with conservative critics of the platform and allowed various banned users, including Trump, to return.
Trump, now running again for president, filed a brief urging the court to hear the Florida case, arguing the law should be upheld.
The Biden administration also asked the Supreme Court to intervene, but for very different reasons, saying that the restrictions in both laws on content moderation and requirements that platforms give individualized explanations for their decisions violate the First Amendment.

• Lawmakers with babies and toddlers push Congress to stop the ‘child care cliff’
• Why Biden is taking a hands-off approach to the looming shutdown
• Poll: Democrats and independents are glad they got Covid vaccines. Most Republicans regret it.
The Florida law among other things prevents companies from banning public figures running for political office and restricts so-called “shadow banning,” whereby certain user content is made difficult to find by other users.
The Texas law prevents platforms from banning users based on the views they express. Both laws require the companies to disclose their moderation policies.
In court papers, Florida Attorney General Ashley Moody wrote that historically states have had the power to regulate companies that transmit other people’s speech, a reference to telecommunications regulations. Florida’s law is aimed at “preventing social media platforms from abusing their power over the public square,” she wrote.
The trade groups responded in court papers that companies, in an effort to combat spam, trolling and overheated rhetoric, have “long exercised editorial discretion in creating and enforcing politics directed at speech that is offensive, objectionable or otherwise contrary to the norms they seek to curate for their particular online communities.”
Referring to the Florida law, the trade groups say it “endeavors to punish select private companies for exercising editorial discretion in ways the state disfavors.” The Florida law exempts companies that operate theme parks in the state, a provision that affects Disney and NBCUniversal, the owner of NBC News.
The Supreme Court in May 2022 blocked the Texas law, preventing it from going into effect. Then, four of the nine justices said the court should not have intervened at that stage.
The Florida measure was blocked by the Atlanta-based 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, prompting the state to appeal to the Supreme Court.
The 11th Circuit’s ruling was in contrast to the New Orleans-based 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, which declined to block the Texas law.
It is unclear if there are enough votes on the Supreme Court, which has a 6-3 conservative majority, to uphold the two laws. Conservative Justice Clarence Thomas has been most outspoken in criticizing how social media companies are protected under existing law, while fellow conservative Justice Samuel Alito wrote a dissenting opinion when the court blocked the Texas law noting the novel legal issues raised.
“It is not at all obvious how our existing precedents, which predate the age of the internet, should apply to large social media companies,” he wrote. His opinion was joined by Thomas and conservative Justice Neil Gorsuch. Liberal Justice Elena Kagan also voted against blocking the law but did not explain her reasons.
The Supreme Court will hear oral arguments and issue a ruling in its new term, which begins next week and ends in June.
Earlier this year, the court sidestepped the major legal question of the scope of immunity internet companies enjoy for content posted by their users under Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act.
The court ended up not deciding the issue, which arose in a case involving Google, because it resolved the case on other grounds.",law

Kenneth Dau-Schmidt, a law professor at Indiana University Bloomington, said that Reagan’s controversial action firing air traffic controllers continues to be condemned and revered, depending on whom you’re talking to.
“There never had a been a president so hostile to union workers, and it could have gone bad,” Dau-Schmidt said. “If one plane went down, Reagan would have looked like a goat.

“But there were no major crashes, and conservatives now just say, ’You have to be tough,” Dau-Schmidt added.
A spokesperson for the Scott campaign defended the senator’s comments.
“Sen. Scott has repeatedly made clear, both at that event and others, that Joe Biden shouldn’t leave taxpayers on the hook for any labor deal,” they said.
Here’s what the law says about firing workers on strike.
Workers have the right to strike
The National Labor Relations Act of 1935 granted private sector workers the right to strike, said Sharon Block, a professor at Harvard Law School and the executive director of the Center for Labor and a Just Economy.
“Under the NLRA, strikers cannot be fired for striking.” Block said.

The idea being, Dau-Schmidt added, that “if capital is going to be organized, then labor should be organized, too.”
However, when Reagan fired the air traffic controllers, he was acting within the law because the NLRA’s right to strike does not apply to federal employees, Dau-Schmidt said.
Although Scott specifically cited a case of firing federal workers at the campaign event, his comments were widely taken as hostile toward all union activity.
Job security still at risk for workers on strike
Even though private sector workers’ on strike are protected from termination, they can in certain cases be temporarily or permanently replaced if their employer hires someone else to do their job, Dau-Schmidt said.
“Permanent replacement looks a lot like firing from the employees’ perspective,” he said.
Still, workers have certain protections.
If a striker’s replacement leaves the job for whatever reason, the worker who was on strike must be offered the position before anyone else is hired, Block said.

If workers were on strike due to unfair labor practices as opposed to economic conditions, they may also have a right to reinstatement.
Beyond the law, it would be foolish from a business perspective for the automakers, or any big company, to hastily part ways with their labor force, Dau-Schmidt said.
“If they started firing these workers, they’d find all of UAW workers on strike,” he said. “It could take months or years to replace everyone, and they’d lose a lot of money.”",law
the_guardian,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/nov/28/uk-anti-strike-rules-may-breach-international-law-mps-and-peers-warn,"Workers in some public sector jobs will be completely prevented from striking under restrictive rules that may breach international law, parliament’s watchdog on human rights has said.
The joint committee on human rights, chaired by the Labour MP Harriet Harman, has written to the government expressing “serious concerns” about its new minimum service levels regulations covering the border force, railways and the NHS.
The letter to Kemi Badenoch, the business secretary, was published as the government prepares to set out new regulations that will also cover teachers, forcing unions to maintain a certain level of staffing in schools during strikes.
The laws have been brought in after a huge wave of strikes last year as workers protested against below-inflation pay rises – and in many cases forced the government to pay out more.
In its letter, the joint committee said the government had failed to allay widespread concerns about whether the anti-strike legislation was compatible with human rights law.
“Particular concerns arise in respect of small ports and airports, where ‘no less effective’ services [in the border force] could result in staff teams being effectively prevented from striking at all,” the committee of MPs and peers said.
For those working on railway services, the regulations say that 40% of passenger services must be maintained. However, those working in infrastructure services such as signalling would have to provide cover between 6am and 10pm on a substantial number of “priority routes”, which the committee said “gave rise to a risk that employees working in infrastructure on those lines would be effectively prevented from striking”.
The MPs and peers said they recognised that the right to take industrial action was not absolute and may be interfered with where necessary and proportionate in the public interest. But it said the measures were “unlikely to be proportionate if alternative, less restrictive measures could be taken that are likely to achieve the same aims”.
They added: “A failure to pursue voluntary arrangements where they are recognised to be sufficient is unlikely to meet this requirement of proportionality.”
The government is also consulting on minimum service levels to cover health workers, but NHS Providers recently warned that the legislation could worsen industrial relations and harm care.
Paul Nowak, general secretary of the TUC, said: “These anti-strike laws are a deliberate attempt to restrict the right to strike – a fundamental British liberty. They are undemocratic, unworkable and likely illegal. And crucially they will poison industrial relations and exacerbate disputes rather than help resolve them.”
A Department for Business and Trade spokesperson said: “The minimum service legislation is compatible with all our international obligations – many members of the EU already have minimum service levels legislation in place covering a broad range of services.
“We’ve been clear that there needs to be a reasonable balance between the right of workers to strike and the rights of the public, who work hard and expect essential services that they pay for to be there when needed.”",law
bbc,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-67550481,"Coup leaders in Niger have overturned an eight-year-old law criminalising migrant smuggling in the country.
The legislation allowed authorities to take action against smugglers who transported migrants through Niger's vast desert on to Libya and Europe.
But President Mohamed Bazoum - who had worked with the EU to stem the flow of people across the Mediterranean - was overthrown in July in a coup.
Gen Abdourahmane Tchiani has since declared himself the new head of state.
His ruling junta announced the repeal in a statement, saying the law ""did not take into account the interests of Niger and its citizens"".
It also said convictions handed down under the 2015 law would be ""erased"".
The move is an indication that the junta in Niger's capital Niamey plans to assert its authority over the country's sovereignty, in defiance of international pressure.
Following the coup in the summer, the EU suspended all security co-operation with the landlocked country in West Africa.
Josep Borrell, the EU's foreign policy chief, joined the US and France in July by refusing to recognise Gen Tchiani as leader. He also said budgetary aid to Niger would be suspended indefinitely.
It is not yet clear how the European bloc will respond to what is a huge blow to its strategy for managing migration flows from Africa.
In 2015, more than a million asylum seekers and migrants tried to reach Europe, prompting the push for Niger to pass the now-overturned law. 
Numbers reduced significantly as a result - but traffickers bemoaned its implementation in the years that followed.
One, Bachir Amma, told the BBC back in 2019: ""If the law was eased I would go back to people trafficking, that's for sure. It earned me as much as $6,000 [£4,700] a week, far more money than anything I can do now.""
He added that the law's strictness meant, if caught, traffickers could go to prison for a ""long time"" and have their vehicles confiscated. 
There are now concerns that trafficking gangs could see the repeal of the law as an opportunity to once again push migrants into countries that border Niger, such as Libya or Algeria, for onward transport to Europe.
Niger is a key part of the African region known as the Sahel - a belt of land that stretches from the Atlantic Ocean to the Red Sea.",law
the_independent,https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/africa/niger-africa-europe-ibrahim-jean-etienne-b2454859.html,"Niger’s junta has signed a decree revoking a 2015 law that was enacted to curb the smuggling of migrants traveling from African countries through a key migration route in Niger en route to Europe, according to a government circular issued on Monday.
“The convictions pronounced pursuant to said law and their effects shall be cancelled,” Niger’s junta leader, Gen. Abdourahmane Tchiani, said in a Nov. 25 decree, a copy of which was seen Monday by The Associated Press.
All those convicted under the law would be considered for release by the Ministry of Justice, Ibrahim Jean Etienne, the secretary general of the justice ministry said in the circular.
The revocation of the law adds a new twist to growing political tensions between Niger and EU countries that sanctioned the West African nation in response to the July coup that deposed its democratically elected president and brought the junta into power.

The law empowered security forces and the courts to prosecute smugglers who faced up to five years in prison if convicted.
While the law transformed Niger into a migration hub housing thousands of migrants being returned to their countries, the U.N. human rights office has also noted that it “led migrants to seek increasingly dangerous migratory routes, leading to increased risks of human rights violations.”
Following the July 26 coup, which deposed Niger’s President Mohamed Bazoum, Western and European countries suspended aid for health, security and infrastructure needs to the country, which relies heavily on foreign support as one of the least developed nations in the world.

bbc,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-north-east-orkney-shetland-67543806,"Five former workers at an Aberdeen paper mill have won their legal action over claims they were made redundant without being properly consulted.
Stoneywood paper mill - which operated for more than 250 years - went into administration last year.
An employment judge has now ruled that the workers were made redundant without a proper 45-day consultation.
It means they are entitled to compensation. The administrators declined to comment.
BBC Scotland News understands that a separate mass legal action on the same consultation period lodged by Unite the union on behalf of about 300 workers is expected to be ruled on shortly. 
• Deadline for paper mill sale passes with no deal
• Redundant mill workers set to take legal action
The five workers, whose job roles included financial control and IT analysis, will now be entitled to compensation, capped at eight weeks of wages.
Lawyer Paul Kissen from Thompsons Solicitors, the firm representing Unite's workers, said the company should have carried out a collective consultation before dismissing staff.


Mr Kissen told BBC Scotland News: ""There should have been a period of 45 days in which the union was consulted in order to identify ways to avoid, reduce or mitigate the consequences of the redundancies - for example, looking for other job opportunities for people, and having meetings with people who were able to say what was going on.
""The administrators failed in their statutory duty to carry out a collective consultation process with these employees before they made everyone redundant.""

Mr Kissen said he expected the ruling on the Unite action to be issued ""imminently"".
""It is all too common that workers who have been working at a company, in some cases for decades are all dismissed without any warning,"" he added.
""In a situation where a company goes out of business, they should still have the consultation, rather than just being dismissed out of the blue as soon as the ship has all but sunk. ""
He added that previous cases with similarities included staff at the department stores Debenhams and Watt Brothers, which both entered administration in recent years.
'Very confident'
Unite legal officer Mark Lyon said: ""Unite are pleased to have taken on the lead on acting for the majority of cases and lodging them for our members at Arjowiggins Scotland Ltd.
""We are pleased the judgements have begun to be handed down, and are very confident of successful outcomes for our members in the coming weeks. 
""Any award for Unite members will be without any solicitors' fees, and all the compensation due will go to our members."" 
Joint administrators from Interpath Advisory said they did not wish to comment. 
In 2019, the business was sold to a new parent company, securing the jobs at the mill.
However, administrators were appointed in September last year.

Around 80 firms have been unable to complete transactions following a service outage affecting IT provider CTS. Dozens of clients hoping to move into their new homes this week have expressed their frustration that deals have fallen through and removal companies have had to be cancelled.
CTS last issued a public comment on Friday when it said the outage was caused by a cyber-incident and it was continuing to work ‘around the clock’ on fixing it.
The company said: ‘Whilst we are confident that we will be able to restore services, we are unable to give a precise timeline for full restoration. We will continue to communicate directly with those of our clients which are impacted by the service outage, providing regular updates on the status of our work to restore services and our investigations into the incident.’
ADVERT
On Monday the Council for Licensed Conveyancers said the sector was experiencing some disruption to transactions arising from the incident.
'As well as keeping their own clients informed of any disruption to their matter in relation to such incidents, we expect any directly affected CLC-regulated practices to ensure that they have alerted lawyers acting on the other side of any relevant transactions,’ it said. ‘This openness is vital for limiting as far as possible disruption and consumer harm.’
Media relations officer Lucy Lisanti, who is part of a four-property chain whose buyer is affected by the outage, told the Gazette she felt in limbo by the ongoing uncertainty. The parties had been due to exchange last Wednesday.
Her unaffected solicitors were informed on Monday evening by the buyer’s firm that its system was still offline, but it was ‘hoping’ to be in a position to complete later this week.
‘We were due to exchange last Wednesday in the midsts of this outage and have effectively been in the dark ever since,’ said Lisanti. ‘This leaves us with so much uncertainty - with movers needing to be booked, days needing to be taken off work at potentially short notice and lives put on hold.’",law

Counsel for the UK Government argued that the threat of serving full sentences in jail is an incentive for offenders to reveal the full truth about their conflict-related crimes in Northern Ireland.
Tony McGleenan KC said: “The sword of Damocles hangs over all those who participated in Troubles-related offences.”
Bereaved relatives and other victims are mounting a major legal challenge against the controversial new legislation.
The Northern Ireland Troubles (Legacy and Reconciliation) Act includes potential offers of immunity from prosecution in return for cooperation with a truth recovery body.
Perpetrators must provide a full account to the Independent Commission for Reconciliation and Information Recovery (ICRIR) headed up by Sir Declan Morgan, a former Lord Chief Justice of Northern Ireland.

But setting out a detailed chronology of events surrounding the drafting of the Bill and its ultimate passing into law, Mr McGleenan cited correspondence from Downing Street in early 2022, during Boris Johnson’s tenure as British Prime Minister.
He stressed how the terms around any conditional amnesties had been “underwritten at the highest level”.
“The Prime Minister made it clear that immunity had to be earned, and that concept, looking at the Act, is exactly what Parliament enshrined,” he said.
“This is a conditional system, immunity is earned by being truthful about your involvement in Troubles-related incidents.
“That truthfulness is incentivised by the prospect of prosecution remaining.”
The ICRIR panel assessing applications for immunity will be able to access other relevant information held by government bodies, the court heard.
If the Commission ultimately decides the perpetrator is not being fully candid it has the power to refer them to the Director of Public Prosecutions.
Mr McGleenan pointed out that anyone ultimately found guilty will no longer be able to benefit from the Good Friday Agreement early release scheme.
“The protection of the 1998 Northern Ireland (Sentences) Act 1998 is disapplied and, if convicted, they will serve a full term,” he said.
“The jeopardy of prosecution is very real.”
Referring to South Africa’s Truth and Reconciliation Commission as a precedent for the ICRIR, he also suggested that its lifespan could be extended beyond the anticipated five-year period.
“It is a question of whether the panel is satisfied,” the barrister maintained.
“If someone comes forward seeking immunity for a major terrorist bombing, making the case they were a peripheral figure such as a getaway driver, the panel can require full disclosure from relevant government bodies of any material that has a bearing on the incident.
“They are entitled to all information available, and assessing the truthfulness of that account is not something done on the fly.”
Mr McGleenan argued the Government remained committed to obtaining information for victims, but that there was a “vanishing” possibility of securing convictions in Troubles-related cases.
Although there is uncertainty about the exact number of civil actions for compensation, the court heard that an estimated 1,000 claims have been lodged.
The case continues.",law
europeanconservative,https://europeanconservative.com/articles/news/hamas-wants-un-to-condemn-wilders-for-violating-international-law/,"Dutch populist firebrand Geert Wilders, fresh after winning the Dutch national elections last week, is facing backlash from the terrorist group Hamas, along with several Arab states, for suggesting that Palestinians should be relocated to Jordan as a means to solve the ongoing conflict between the Palestinians and Israel. 
Hamas has called on the international community as well as the United Nations to condemn Wilders for breaking international law, seven weeks after the group murdered around 1,200 Israelis in a surprise terror attack. 
According to a report from the Israeli news website Ynet last week, Wilders has made comments in the past claiming that Jordan should change its name to Palestine and allow the Palestinian people to settle there, putting an end to their conflict with the Israelis and allowing the Palestinians to have their own state.
Over the weekend, on Saturday, November 25th, Wilders reiterated his position on X, the social media site formerly known as Twitter, saying “Jordan is Palestine!”
Both the Arab League and the Palestinian Authority slammed Wilders for his remarks, with the Palestinian Authority claiming Wilders was issuing ”a call to escalate the aggression against our people and a blatant interference in their affairs and future.”
Hamas, the Palestinian Gaza-based terrorist group who murdered over a thousand Israeli civilians on October 7th, also released their own statement regarding Wilders:
	We strongly condemn the statement of the Dutch extremist Wilders, who calls for the displacement of our people to Jordan, which calls for widespread international condemnation
We in the Islamic Resistance Movement (Hamas) condemn in the strongest terms the racist statement of Dutch extremist Geert Wilders, in which he called for the displacement of our people to Jordan, and we consider it a fascist position aligned with the plans of the Nazi-Zionist occupation, in a delusional attempt to displace our people from their land and Islamic and Christian sanctities.
We call on the international community and the United Nations to condemn this racist, fascist statement that violates international law and the right of our people to their land, and we affirm that our Palestinian people will continue their legitimate struggle against the occupation until its demise, and achieve their national aspirations in a Palestinian state with Jerusalem as its capital, despite the noses of the neo-Nazis.
Wilders mocked the Hamas statement saying, “Hamas complaining about international law,” adding a clown face emoji.
Wilders has been a longtime supporter of Israel and has previously called the country “the West’s first line of defence against Islam.”
The firebrand Party for Freedom (PVV) leader has also been a longstanding critic of the religion of Islam as a whole, equating radical Islamist mosques to Nazism, labelling them “Nazi temples” and proposing that the Netherlands ban the Quran and close all mosques in the country in 2016 as part of a “de-Islamification” platform.
As a result of his views, Wilders has been under heavy police protection since 2004 due to threats from Islamist radicals following the murder of filmmaker Theo Van Goghthat same year, who was killed by a Muslim originally from Morocco. ",law

trains,https://www.trains.com/trn/news-reviews/news-wire/u-s-solicitor-general-says-federal-law-preempts-state-regulation-of-grade-crossings/,"WASHINGTON — Federal regulation of railroads preempts state laws regarding regulation of grade crossings, U.S. Solicitor General Elizabeth Prelogar has told the U.S. Supreme Court in a filing on behalf of the federal government.

The filing, reported by WXIX-TV, came as the court considers whether to hear Ohio’s appeal of case regarding the ability of states to regulate blocked grade crossings.

The Supreme Court had asked the Solicitor General to explain the federal government’s view of the question in March [see “Supreme Court asks federal government for opinion …,” Trains News Wire, March 21, 2023]. Prelogar’s filing supports a 2022 decision by Ohio’s Supreme Court that overturned a state law, under which CSX Transportation had been cited numerous times for blocking a grade crossing while serving a Honda plant in Marysville, Ohio [see “Ohio Supreme Court strikes down …,” News Wire, Aug 18, 2022]. Lower courts have long held that state and local laws regarding blocked crossings are preempted by federal laws regulating matters of interstate commerce.

But Ohio’s Attorney General, Dave Yost, has asked the federal court to overturn the state court’s decision on public-safety grounds, and 19 other state attorneys general have filed an amicus brief asking for the U.S. Supreme Court to hear the appeal and clarify if Congress had indeed granted the Surface Transportation Board sole jurisdiction over matters regulating crossings [see “Kansas attorney general joins group asking Supreme Court to review …,” News Wire, Dec. 23, 2022] The amicus brief, available here, contends rulings have misinterpreted the law, saying it established jurisdiction over rates and practices but is silent on matters of safety.


Prelogar’s filing, however, urges the court not to take the case, including in its arguments that “Congress’s desire for national uniformity has remained steadfast even as its regulatory goals have evolved” and that the Ohio law “unreasonably burden[s] interstate commerce.” It also argues that “Congress’s choice to provide funding to eliminate grade crossings rather than to specify its own blocked-crossing rule is consistent with its duel focus on deregulation and national uniformity.”

WXIX also notes that an amicus brief has been filed by the International Association of Sheet Metal, Air, Rail, and Transportation Workers-Transportation Division; Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers and Trainmen; and Academy of Rail Labor Attorneys in support of Ohio’s request for a review of the state court decision. The labor groups’ filing argues that unless the lower court decision is overturned, states and the Federal Railroad Administration would be unable to regulate matters of railroad safety.",law

		Last week, the legal drama featuring the world’s largest crypto exchange and United States law enforcement ended with a plea deal. Binance and Changpeng “CZ” Zhao have admitted violating U.S. Anti-Money Laundering laws, agreeing to pay $4.3 billion in fines. CZ resigned as CEO of Binance as part of the deal. Binance’s former head of regional markets outside the U.S., Richard Teng, is the new CEO.
		Cardano founder Charles Hoskinson reflected on the plea deal news, calling it “the end of an era.” In Hoskinson’s opinion, entrepreneurs must comply with regulations or develop permissionless protocols that can’t be regulated. Hoskinson warned that the world is changing and that entrepreneurs will no longer be able to get by using centralized systems while simultaneously not complying with regulations. This is because “the United States has a financial regime that basically has been weaponized,” and this regime will not allow entrepreneurs to open up markets that let “the enemies of America to basically trade and do things.”
		Meanwhile, Kraken, another major crypto exchange, has been dragged into another legal fight with the U.S. Securities Exchange Commission (SEC). In a complaint filed in a San Francisco federal court, the SEC claimed that Kraken has been operating a platform that unlawfully facilitated the buying and selling of cryptocurrencies since 2018. Additionally, the SEC alleged Kraken’s business practices and “deficient” internal controls saw the exchange commingle up to $33 billion worth of customer assets with its own. The SEC said this resulted in a “significant risk of loss” for its clients. Kraken founder Jesse Powell called the action an “assault on America” and called the SEC the U.S.’s “top decel.” Powell even warned other companies to depart the country.

The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit said Bankman-Fried’s previous attempts to tamper with two witnesses while on pretrial release were a major reason behind rejecting his request. “We have reviewed the Defendant-Appellant’s additional arguments and find them unpersuasive,” the court said.

BlackRock presented how the firm could use an in-kind or in-cash redemption model for its iShares Bitcoin Trust. It’s unclear how SEC officials responded to the two proposed models or if they intend to approve a spot BTC ETF after numerous delays and rejections. Many reports have suggested the SEC could be nearing a decision on a spot BTC ETF for listing on U.S. markets. If approved, it would be a significant move toward mainstream crypto adoption.

 has just fought and beaten a faction of Abbas’s Fatah party for control of Gaza.
Fatah lost the 2006 Palestinian legislative elections and was unhappy with the result, attacking the winners, Hamas.
This spelled not only a political fracturing but also a geographical one. The Palestinians split into the occupied West Bank, partially governed by the PA, and Gaza under Hamas.

The situation had remained frozen since then – until now when Palestinians’ political future seems more uncertain than ever.
Israel’s stated objective for its current bombardment and ground offensivein the Gaza Strip in retaliation for Hamas’s surprise attacks on October 7 in southern Israel has been to take out the armed group.
If Israel is successful, the return of the PA to the beleaguered enclave is being touted as a possibility. But will it return? And can it?
Gaza under Hamas
Under Hamas, the Gaza Strip has been besieged, impoverished by Israel and assaulted on five occasions in the past 17 years.
In this latest assault, the Palestinian political future looks very precarious.

Israel said it aims to destroy Hamas entirely and that is why it launched an all-out assault on the Gaza Strip on October 7.
Israeli raids, settler violence and settlement expansions in the occupied West Bank are among the reasons Hamas launched its attacks on October 7, Izzat al-Rasheq, a member of Hamas’s Political Bureau, said.
“We warned the Israelis and the international community that this relentless pressure will result in an explosion, but they did not listen,” al-Rasheq told Al Jazeera, adding that incursions on Al-Aqsa Mosque, thousands of unjustly detained Palestinians, and the blockade on Gaza all played a role as well.
In a scenario in which Israel succeeds in eliminating Hamas somehow, it has been suggested by the US that the PA take over the beleaguered enclave.
So far, Israel does not agree, but what do the Palestinians think of the PA? Can it return to Gaza? And can Hamas be destroyed?

Collusion vs confrontation
The crux of the divide between the two most dominant players in Palestinian politics is their differing approaches to the Palestinian cause.
While Fatah and the PA, whose current leadership is one and the same, focus on cooperation with Israel, Hamas’s strategy is to confront Israel militarily, said Aboud Hamayel, a lecturer at Birzeit University in the West Bank.
“There’s nothing we can do,” Hamayel said, mimicking what he said is the PA’s defeatist tone.
The PA’s support base in the West Bank is based on a transactional relationship with Israel, the analyst said. However, some Fatah factions do take part in the armed struggle in the West Bank, where the movement is more vocal and diverse than the PA, he added.
Fatah still exists in Gaza, where it is now in the opposition. Its supporters there are split between loyalty to Abbas and former Fatah leader Mohammed Dahlan, who has been in exile in the United Arab Emirates for 10 years, Hamayel said.

The PA has international recognition and receives funding and tax revenues. In turn, it manages security in its territory, theoretically freeing Israel from dealing with day-to-day Palestinian life, Hamayel said, except when Israel conducts raids and arrests resisting Palestinians.

The post-war question
Fatah does want to achieve unity with Hamas, according to the group’s spokesperson, even though several attempts over the years to do that have failed.
“Through national dialogue, we will reach a consensus on how to govern ourselves, how to lead our cause and present it to the world,” Jamal Nazzal, a Fatah spokesperson and a member of its parliamentary body, the Revolutionary Council, told Al Jazeera.
A unified Palestinian entity is the stated US goal, especially as discussions arise on the fate of Gaza after the war, according to Kenneth Katzman, a senior fellow at the New York-based Soufan Center.
This entity would control both Gaza and the West Bank, accept Israel’s existence and resume Oslo negotiations with Israel, he said, referring to agreements between Israel and the umbrella Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) in the 1990s.
“I think the intent is to get back to where the talks left off,” Katzman told Al Jazeera, adding that they would be the precursor to Washington mediating a two-state solution.

Rafe Jabari, a French-Palestinian political science analyst, agreed that a two-state solution should be pursued after the war’s end but said a new agreement should be drawn up to replace the Oslo Accords because Palestinians were coerced to make too many concessions in that process.
Israel will be unwilling to relinquish control of the lands it occupies, he added, and it will not be able to take out Hamas as it says it wants to. “Hamas is a part of Palestinian society. They can’t eliminate Hamas,” he told Al Jazeera, adding that they’re not just a political wing.
Hamas agrees. “They cannot rearrange the Palestinian house to suit themselves. Hamas will remain, and what comes after Hamas will also be Hamas,” said al-Rasheq, adding that Palestinians would not accept “the US or Israel or anyone else” telling them who should govern them.
“The Palestinian people will never accept an entity that enters Gaza on an Israeli tank,” he said.
Because it is impossible to eradicate Hamas, Jabari said, the group will have to be involved in any post-war negotiations.

“All actors should be involved in the resolution of the conflict,” he said, citing past negotiations in which that occurred even when one party was viewed as a “terrorist group”, such as during the French-Algeria peace agreement in 1962 or, more recently, in talks between the US and the Taliban.
A transition period involving an international peacekeeping force in Gaza was mentioned by both Katzman and Jabari as a possible first step before negotiations.
But, Jabari added, these forces have been abject failures in recent conflicts.

The PA’s waning popularity
The PA’s government in the West Bank is seen by many Palestinians as collusion with Israel.
Much of the frustration is with Abbas, who is seen as weak for not managing to advance any peace processes in his nearly two decades in power, Jabari said. He is also seen as not having advocated enough against Israel’s practices from settlement expansions to harassment of Palestinians, he added.
Advertisement 
PA security practices in the occupied West Bank have also been criticised as heavy-handed but, Nazzal said, the PA needs to “restore order and protect the law”.
“Movements of the Palestinian security forces or officials or normal individuals sometimes require security coordination with the occupying power,” he said, adding that everything the PA administers in the occupied West Bank “has to be coordinated with Israel”.
Nazzal distanced Fatah from the PA, however, saying it is “a liberation movement that doesn’t have any sort of contact with Israel”.
Despite frustration with the PA, Katzman said Palestinians who are bearing the brunt of the Israeli aggression may be more disgruntled with Hamas’s actions.
“Much of the Gaza population now realises that Hamas is going to keep dragging them into a war with Israel, and they don’t want that,” he said. “So I think they’re willing to overlook the Palestinian Authority’s faults. I think that’s true for Palestinians in the West Bank as well. They don’t want … forever war with Israel.”

However, al-Reshaq said: “Palestinians everywhere support Hamas more. They see Hamas is working to resist the occupation,” he said, adding that global support for Palestinians has surged in the past few weeks.

Biden says Palestinian Authority should ultimately govern Gaza and West Bank
‘The beginning of the end’?
With mixed support for the PA among Palestinians, what is the likelihood of it returning to govern Gaza?
Nazzal pointed out that, despite Hamas rule, the PA already runs certain elements of life in Gaza, such as the health and education ministries and the banking system.
Meanwhile, the Fatah movement, he added, is opposed to a future in which Hamas is taken out.“We do not agree on the Israeli military objectives in Gaza, nor can we predict what will be the outcome of this terrible assault that Israel has launched against our people,” Nazzal said.
What Fatah knows, however, is that Palestinians should decide who governs them through legislative elections that secure a path for the two-state solution, he added.

“The only thing that nobody has tried is for the Palestinians to live freely in an independent state of their own,” Nazzal said. “Until that happens, we will keep going from one cycle of violence to the next.”
The US is still ramping up its push for the return of the PA in Gaza, though, and the reasons President Joe Biden’s administration has for this strategy is multifold, Hamayel said.
First is to buy time for Israel to finish its military operations by distracting the international community, he said.
It wants to allow its ally to retaliate for Hamas’s October 7 attacks while coaxing it to think about what’s next, the analyst said.
The White House also wants to keep its regional allies on side, especially as Arab states struggle with their citizens not feeling that they are doing enough to end the Israeli assault, according to Hamayel.

However, he concluded, the PA takeover would happen only if Hamas loses, an outcome still too early to predict.

Hamas, meanwhile, sees weakness in Israel’s seemingly directionless attack on civilians.
“The size of the defeat [on October 7] made [Israel] lose its mind and strike out in any direction with no thought,” al-Reshaq said. “It has failed. It failed on the battlefield on October 7 when faced with the Qassam Brigades, and it is failing now because it is unable to achieve any real goals in Gaza.”
In the event that Israel cannot take Hamas out, the fissure between the two Palestinian political groups will deepen, Hamayel predicted.
Hamas would remain standing, a valiant hero for Palestinians for fighting Israel, and the PA would appear weak, shamed for cooperating with Israel over the years, he said.
That would kick off a vicious cycle of a seemingly weak PA inspiring more settler activity in the West Bank, which would erode the group’s control of the territory more and more, he said.
“This could be the beginning of the end of the PA,” Hamayel said.",politics

Bavarian Premier Markus Söder called today for an early German federal election, arguing that voters have lost faith in the country’s ruling three-party coalition following a constitutional court ruling that has plunged Germany into a budget crisis.
“The whole traffic light system [i.e. coalition] is not working,” Söder, the conservative leader of the Christian Social Union (CSU), said in a post on X, formerly Twitter. “That’s why a fundamental change is needed.” Early elections, he added, “would be the right way forward.”
Söder’s call for an early election comes as the government grapples with the political fallout of a major budgetary crisis. Earlier this month, the country’s top court ruled it had been unconstitutional to repurpose €60 billion left over from an emergency COVID-19 fund for climate projects. More broadly, the ruling also limits the government’s ability to draw from a variety of special funds created to circumvent the country’s constitutionally enshrined debt brake, which restricts the federal deficit to 0.35 percent of GDP except in times of emergency.
As the government struggles to manage the practical ramifications of the ruling, Finance Minister Christian Lindner, leader of the economically liberal Free Democrats (FDP), signaled last week that he will seek to suspend the debt brake for 2023 by retroactively declaring an emergency. On Monday, Chancellor Olaf Scholz’s cabinet approved a supplementary budget for 2023 to be submitted to the Bundestag for approval.

The crisis has forced the government to freeze new spending and to put approval of next year’s budget on hold. 
Germany’s ruling coalition was already suffering from historically low approval ratings even before the budget crisis. Söder’s call for an early election illustrates how the country’s center-right opposition is now seeking to capitalize on the disarray sparked by the ruling.
Söder also slammed Lindner, saying he doesn’t believe his FDP is “still in a position to be a stable government partner in the long term.”
Amid growing calls, particularly on the political left, for the debt brake to be reformed to increase financial wiggle room, Söder said on Monday that he does not support a reform or the abolition of the rule, according to German news.
Söder said an early federal election could take place on June 9 in order to coincide with EU elections.",politics

“If you bring the sides together in a bipartisan way, and you create a strong middle, that’s what the country needs in order to be healthy, I believe,” Dalio said Tuesday in conversation with CNBC’s Dan Murphy onstage at the Abu Dhabi Finance Week.

Two things are crucial for the U.S. in this process, Dalio said: Firstly, he assesses that those with extreme political views should be alienated. Secondly, the country needs to “bring together the smart moderates to work together, and then to be able to make important reforms” to enable addressing issues such as the wealth gap.
Concerns about wealth inequality have grown in recent years and been accelerated by the Covid-19 pandemic.
In the second quarter of 2023, the wealthiest 10% of U.S. households held around $7 million on average, whilst the bottom 50% had an average of $51,000, according to a reportby the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis released last month.
“The wealth gap is a productivity gap. You have to make most people, in one way or another, productive. You can’t just give them money,” Dalio said Tuesday.
Dalio’s comments come as the U.S. heads for its next presidential election, and recent polls have pointed to potential trouble ahead for incumbent Democratic President Joe Biden.

Former President Donald Trump, who could become the Republican presidential candidate again, leads against Biden in five out of six so-called swing states, a survey by The New York Times and Siena College found earlier this month.
Dalio on Tuesday said that both parties face questions about their prospective presidential nominees.
Dalio expects the emergence of an alternative candidate to Trump among Republicans, as the party narrows down its final choice. Democrats are meanwhile facing internal divisions and concerns about Biden’s age, he added.

Both Biden and Trump face criticism not just from their respective opposition, but also from within their own parties.
Trump has been engulfed in controversy about the ongoing investigation into the Jan. 6 Capitol riot led by his supporters, as well as his political stances on topics including abortion rights and immigration. Meanwhile, Biden’s track record holding the top job has been seen critically by voters who cite the challenges of the economy and his difficulties to implement several of his key policies, such as student loan forgiveness.
This makes for a “very interesting and very important” political situation, compounded by differences in values and wealth across the U.S. — which Dalio says will need to be addressed after the election.

Comer later Tuesday appeared to reject Hunter Biden’s proposal for a public hearing on Dec. 13 — but left the door open for him to testify before Congress at a later date.
“Hunter Biden is trying to play by his own rules instead of following the rules required of everyone else,” Comer said in a statement. “That won’t stand with House Republicans. Our lawfully issued subpoena to Hunter Biden requires him to appear for a deposition on December 13.”
“We expect full cooperation with our subpoena for a deposition,” Comer said, adding that investigators “also agree that Hunter Biden should have opportunity to testify in a public setting at a future date.”

Comer and other Republicans accuse the president of being involved in, and profiting from, influence-peddling schemes devised by his family members, intended to enrich one another by virtue of their ties to a powerful politician.
The White House has roundly denied any wrongdoing by the president. Democrats have blasted the impeachment efforts as a political fishing expedition.
“Your Committee has been working for almost a year—without success—to tie our client’s business activities to his father,” Lowell wrote in Tuesday’s letter.
He accused Comer of hypocrisy, for claiming that he wants to probe potential conflicts of interest surrounding the business activities of a president’s family, while “turning a blind eye toward former President Trump and his family’s businesses.”
“Unlike members of the Trump family, Hunter is a private person who has never worked in any family business nor ever served in the White House or in any public office,” wrote Lowell.
“Notwithstanding this stark difference, you have manipulated Hunter’s legitimate business dealings and his times of terrible addiction into a politically motivated basis for hearings to accuse his father of some wrongdoing,” Lowell wrote.
Lowell said they were offering Comer a public hearing with Hunter Biden, instead of a deposition behind closed doors, because, “We have seen you use closed-door sessions to manipulate, even distort the facts and misinform the public.”
“We therefore propose opening the door,” he wrote.",politics

Last week Finland had closed all but one of its border crossings with Russia with the goal of halting an inflow of asylum seekers from the country. The Finnish government has repeatedly suggested that the refugees were guided to the border by Russian authorities.
Close to 1,000 people from countries that are not Finland or Russia have entered Finland since August, and most of them have sought asylum in Finland, the government said Tuesday.

President Joe Biden took aim at corporations Monday for charging prices he said were artificially high even though the rate of inflation has slowed and some shipping costs have fallen.
“Any corporation that has not brought their prices back down, even as inflation has come down, even as the supply chains have been rebuilt, it’s time to stop the price gouging,” Biden said at the launch of a new White House supply chain initiative. “Give the American consumer a break.”

While it’s true that the annual rate of inflation has cooled from its high last summer, this doesn’t translate directly into falling consumer prices. It only means that prices are rising at a lower rate.
Prices for some everyday goods have fallen over the past year, a reality reflected in lower Thanksgiving costs this year, for example. And lower costs have in turn left some consumers with more money in their budgets for things like Black Fridayshopping, when U.S. online sales rose 7.5% this past weekend over a year ago.
As Biden runs for reelection, the White House has sought to claim these broad spending and pricing trends as victories for the president and his economic agenda, dubbed Bidenomics.
But the argument that Biden deserves the credit for a strong economic recovery has proven to be a tough sell to voters, who consistently give the president low marks on the economy.
“We understand that people are still not feeling it, we get that,” White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said Monday, ahead of the president’s supply chain event.

Faced with a skeptical audience, targeting so-called junk fees, which Biden said “companies sneak into your bill,” offers the White House with a chance to directly show voters what Biden is doing on their behalf.
It also provides the president with an easy target in the inflation blame game.
“Junk fees take real money out of the pockets of average Americans,” Biden said Monday. “They can add up to hundreds of dollars, weighing down family budgets and making it harder for families to pay their bills.”
Consumers, said Biden, “feel like they’re being played for suckers. Which they are.”

cnn,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/11/27/politics/biden-extension-gaza-pause/index.html,"CNN — 
The fragile pause in Israel’s onslaught against Hamas in Gaza, which has enabled the release so far of 58 hostages, has been surprisingly enduring given that neither side is in direct contact and each is bent on obliterating the other.
The question now is how long the intersection of interests that led to the deal will prevail, allowing the return of more of those abducted in the Hamas terror attacks in Israel and the entry into Gaza of more trucks of desperately needed aid.
While Americans celebrated Thanksgiving, a rush of developments in the Middle East led to emotional reunions among hostages and their families. But the plight of the majority still in captivity and that of Palestinian civilians underscored the brutal toll of the war. And with President Joe Biden back in Washington after his holiday weekend in Nantucket, Massachusetts, medium- and longer-term factors are coming into view that suggest the fighting could soon be raging again – and become even more intractable and costly.

Truce gives Gazans moment to breathe – and reveals scale of devastation
Still, hopes are rising that after the agreed four-day span of releases, the deal will not end as scheduled on Monday. Hamas is pushing to enact a clause in the original arrangement that would see extra days of pauses in Israeli strikes in return for the freeing of each group of 10 hostages. The Israeli Cabinet has discussed the idea and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu told Biden in a call Sunday an extension would be welcome, his office said in a statement. And the US and Qatar – the two critical intermediaries in the deal – are seeking to use the momentum of the pause to create a foundation for a more permanent end to the fighting that could see more hostages freed and civilians shielded in Gaza.
In the short term, Israel and Hamas both appear to have strong reasons to continue the truce. Netanyahu, who has been under extreme pressure from the families of those held captive, may get a measure of political relief as more hostages come home. Hamas, meanwhile, has benefited from the halt in Israeli airstrikes and ground operations that is likely to enable it to regroup and prepare for an expected widened Israeli assault on its southern strongholds. The US is seeking the return of Americans held or unaccounted for after the Hamas raids on October 7, and Biden has a strong imperative in delaying or preventing more civilian carnage in Gaza – both for humanitarian reasons and to temper a domestic political backlash from young and progressive voters who have condemned his unshakable support for Israel.
And there’s pain far away from Gaza and Israel. A suspect was arrested in the shooting of three Palestinian college students in Vermont. Jason J. Eaton, 48, was arrested Sunday afternoon near the scene of the attack, the Burlington Police Department said in a news release. Police did not detail early Monday what charges he was facing. CNN has been unable to establish whether Eaton has a lawyer. The attack follows an upsurge of antisemitism that has also made American Jews feel less safe.
Why the Gaza pause may eventually unravel
An extended pause in the fighting would play into humanitarian aims, but time may be short before the strategic goals of Israel or Hamas shift. That means the fate of the remaining hostages – including a large group of young males and some members of the Israeli security forces – remains deeply uncertain.
The current situation, for instance, means that Hamas has regained the capacity to set the tempo of the conflict by using hostages as leverage to shape Israeli responses and military activity. The pause is complicating what Israel vows will be a drive to wipe out the Islamist movement. And the fate of remaining hostages balanced against the wider goals of the Israeli military will increasingly pose a stark moral dilemma for Netanyahu’s government.
The time may also be approaching when the lopsided nature of the exchanges – three Palestinians released from Israeli prisons in exchange for each hostage – may become politically unsustainable for Netanyahu, whose reeling government relies on a coalition of hawkish far-right parties. As the numbers of its hostages slowly dwindles, Hamas may eventually lose the incentive to free large groups as it seeks to retain leverage.
One uncertainty from the US perspective is how much pressure Biden, who spoke again to Netanyahu on Sunday, will impose on the Israelis to continue the pause as long as is possible. But, if the pause ends, would US support for Israel’s right to target Hamas be just as strong as it was before the truce? The delicate US-Israel dynamic explains why it makes sense for Hamas to hold onto some American hostages in the hope of forcing Biden to constrain Israel. “If they keep holding American hostages, that will keep the US focused on this and keep the US keeping pressure on the Israelis,” retired US Lt. Gen. Ben Hodges told CNN on Sunday. A return to battle might also weaken Israel’s already shaky international backing.

4-year-old Israeli American hostage is released
Biden national security adviser Jake Sullivan encapsulated the balancing act the president would face in such circumstances without indicating exactly how he would respond. “President Biden believes any country, including Israel, has a right and responsibility to defend itself against that kind of enemy,” Sullivan said on CNN’s “State of the Union” on Sunday. “He also believes that any military operations have to be conducted in a way that protects civilians, that distinguishes terrorists from civilians, and that ensures that those civilians have safe places to be and access to lifesaving humanitarian aid.”
While strategic choices ahead are acute, the releases of hostages so far – and the more than 100 trucks of humanitarian aid that have entered Gaza – have represented a rare moment of hope and relief in a horrendous conflict. Among those released on Sunday was 4-year-old Abigail Edan, who was the youngest American held and the first US citizen freed since the start of the truce. Biden spoke with the family of the girl, whose parents were both murdered on October 7, and told Americans that though she was safe, she’d been through “a terrible trauma.” Biden’s address was a welcome break in a crisis that has caused him considerable political damage. But beset by low approval ratings and political attacks from all sides as he seeks reelection, the president faces a perilous road ahead – especially if the fighting resumes in Gaza.
Biden has faced sharp criticism from inside the Democratic Party over his refusal to call for a permanent ceasefire in a war that has revealed splits in his electoral coalition. Younger, progressive voters – whose turnout is key for Biden next year – have been critical of Israel’s response to the terror attack, while anger is also growing among Arab Americans, who are key to the Democrats’ hopes in the swing state of Michigan.
But the president is also attracting critiques from the right. While GOP presidential candidate Chris Christie said the president deserved some credit for brokering the deal, he told CNN’s Dana Bash on “State of the Union” that he was concerned Biden was leaning too strongly on Netanyahu.
Christie warned that Biden was starting to wrongly “err” into saying that he hopes the truce continues. “He can’t be doing that kind of stuff, in my view, publicly,” the former New Jersey governor said. “His voice has to be just purely supportive of what Israel is doing to try to protect its territorial integrity and the safety and security of its 9 million citizens.”
US aid package for Israel may be delayed until next year
Biden has been calling for weeks for Congress to pass $14.3 billion in emergency aid for Israel. And Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer told his Democratic colleagues in a letter Sunday that he’ll bring to the floor a national security package that ties together Israel and Ukraine funding as soon as next week. But such a measure would still face tough challenges in the GOP-controlled House.

Schumer aiming to bring bill tying Israel and Ukraine funding to Senate floor next week
House Republicans did pass their own measure but, in a political stunt, attached cuts to Internal Revenue Service funding that they knew were unacceptable to Democrats, who run the Senate. Pro-Donald Trump Republicans, meanwhile, oppose efforts from some Democrats and Senate Republicans to twin the measure with a new $60 billion aid package for Ukraine. And any package is in jeopardy because of the narrow House GOP majority, which is effectively controlled by hardliners. That means the only way Republicans would be likely to vote for a measure is if it includes Democratic concessions on the southern border.
House Intelligence Chairman Mike Turner told NBC’s “Meet the Press” on Sunday he’s not optimistic the measure will pass this year. “I think it’d be very difficult to get it done by the end of the year. And the impediment currently is the White House policy on the southern border,” the Ohio Republican said.
In another sign that differences over the package could lead to further delays, Sen. Chris Murphy said he’d be open to conditioning Israeli aid on the protection of Palestinian civilians. “We regularly condition our aid to allies based upon compliance with US law and international law,” the Connecticut Democrat said on “State of the Union.” “And so I think it’s very consistent with the ways in which we have dispensed aid, especially during wartime, to allies.”
The political strategizing taking place in Israel, the United States and beyond has not begun to consider what the region might look like after the war. The Biden administration is reiterating support for a two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict that looks more distant than ever after the October 7 attacks. And Israeli President Isaac Herzog told CNN’s Wolf Blitzer in an interview Sunday that he supported the idea for an “international coalition” to monitor Gaza after Hamas had been eradicated in the war.
But that is all in the far distant. For now, the key question is how long the war will be paused and whether hostages will keep being sent to freedom and safety.

The Gaza hostage deal represents a rare moment of humanity in a savage conflict that has inflicted unfathomable violence on both Israeli and Palestinian civilians.
For the child and female hostages expected to be released during a pause in the fighting and their families, it represents everything — a chance of life seven weeks after a Hamas terror attack on Israeli soil slaughtered 1,200 people.
There were growing hopes, for example, on Tuesday night that American Avigail Idan, who turns four on Friday and whose mother and father were murdered in the attacks on October 7, could be among the first released.
“I am very hopeful, our family is hopeful, it’s been 45 days since (Avigail) was abducted and taken to Gaza,” her great aunt Elizabeth Hirsh Naftali told CNN’s Pamela Brown. “It’s excruciating. For our family, we have spent the last seven weeks – seven weeks – worrying, wondering, praying, hoping.”

Inside the painstaking negotiations between Israel, Hamas, the US and Qatar to free 50 hostages
The hours to come will be agonizing for loved ones waiting for their relatives – and even more so for those whose family members are not on the list to be freed in this preliminary arrangement. Much remains uncertain, including when the pause will start, how and when hostages will start to emerge and if the agreement will last.
The complex agreement was brokered by Qatar, which served as an intermediary between Hamas and Israel in exhaustive negotiations with the close involvement of the United States, and was endorsed by the Israeli cabinet early Wednesday local time.
It will likely require similar attention from all involved to implement in a vicious war zone and it will be at risk of unravelling at any moment. This is because of a vacuum of trust between two bitter enemies and the extreme logistical challenges of extracting hostages from a territory that waited weeks for the arrival of a few aid trucks amid a raging Israeli offensive.
The carefully choreographed plan would see the release of at least 50 women and children held in Gaza by Hamas in exchange for a four-day truce in Israel’s air and ground campaign against the Islamist group, an Israel government statement said. The announcement also held out the potential for the truce to extend beyond the original four-day period, given that an extra day could be added for each 10 additional hostages available for release. Hamas said in a statement that 150 Palestinian prisoners would be released from Israeli jails.
Nothing is certain until the hostages start coming out. And the sequencing of the agreement means there will be a constant risk of incidents that could disrupt it.
But the weeks of negotiations at least proved that intense diplomatic efforts can accomplish something concrete, even if the agreement is far from the ceasefire that Israel’s critics are demanding internationally after a conflict that produced harrowing scenes of Israeli kids killed in their beds and Palestinian hospitals under Israeli fire.
The deal is the most significant diplomatic breakthrough since the Hamas attacks, and may temporarily ease some of the pressure on Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, whose legacy will now be forever tarnished by October 7.
The White House will greet the deal as a significant victory and a first success after weeks of painstaking personal engagement by President Joe Biden and top foreign policy and intelligence officials that threatened to go nowhere. Biden held multiple phone calls with Netanyahu and the emir of Qatar. His envoy, Brett McGurk, and Secretary of State Antony Blinken were intimately involved in the region. The Israeli leader said Tuesday that the president had been responsible for improving the deal at critical moments.
The agreement, even if it fully delivers on its potential, is unlikely to permanently ease Netanyahu’s tenuous political plight. He’s trapped between the extreme right-wing coalition members he chose as a last resort to cling to power and an Israeli public that blames him for the Hamas attacks. And Biden has already absorbed considerable domestic political damage for his steadfast support for the Israeli response. Heart-rending video of civilian carnage in Gaza has caused some young and Arab American voters in the Democratic base to revolt, furthering weakening Biden’s shaky electoral coalition with his reelection race heating up.
The impending hostage release deal is also the latest example of Qatar’s capacity to play on all sides of a treacherous regional power game. Home to Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh, the oil rich Arab nation also hosts a vast US air base that is critical to American national security – a duality that reflects the Emirate’s emerging role as a Middle Eastern power with wider aspirations.
There will be some hope that the agreement, if honored by both sides, could lead to further breakthroughs and improve the prospects for more hostages still captive in Gaza. Their continued incarceration – presumably in dark tunnels beneath the war-torn enclave – tempered the sense of euphoria about those who are expected to be freed.
The first step for the precarious agreement will be gathering the hostages and facilitating their transfer and initiating the pause in fighting and the entry into Gaza of humanitarian aid under the deal. The potential for snags is ever present. As Gershon Baskin, a former Israeli peace activist who once acted as a channel to Hamas, put it on Tuesday: “You have to remember Israel is negotiating with people who it intends to kill — there is no trust between the parties.”
The hostage breakthrough – and the expected release of a fraction of those captured by Hamas on October 7 – raises the question of what happens to those left behind. The answer will be tough for their loved ones to hear.
“If it took this long to get women and children out, what does it look like for the Israeli soldiers that are being held?” said Christopher O’Leary, a former US government director of hostage recovery. “It could be a very protracted period that they are held, which is why going back on offensive military operations after this tactical pause is going to be required,” O’Leary told CNN International’s Richard Quest.
Even so, international expectations might subtly shift during the truce, making a resumption of Israel’s offensive harder than Netanyahu might wish.
Longer term, hopes that a broader peace initiative could grow from this small first step risk being undercut by the searing reality of the conflict.
Israel believes it is fighting an existential war not just for its national survival but for that of the Jewish people. Hamas fighters in Gaza are fighting against obliteration or embracing martyrdom and while the group’s leaders might seek to leverage remaining hostages for thousands of Palestinians in Israeli jails, the most likely scenario is a fight to the finish in Gaza after the pause ends. This would inevitably mean new Israel Defense Force advances on Palestinian population centers and more deaths among trapped civilians that will further exacerbate the brittle international situation inside Israel, the US and elsewhere.
“There is no scenario to end this war without Israel making sure Hamas is no longer in control of their territory. That means killing all their operatives and their leaders, their political and military leaders,” Baskin told CNN Max.",politics

Biden makes case for wartime aid to Israel, Ukraine

CNN — 
Weeks after the Biden administration laid out the details of a $105 billion national security package that includes funding for both Israel and Ukraine, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said he would bring the supplemental request to the floor as soon as next week.
But the effort faces steep hurdles in getting through Congress. Among them: The House and Senate are divided over whether to continue sending aid to Ukraine, and Republican lawmakers want to tie the funding to tightening immigration laws.
The supplemental package would provide security support to Israel, bolster Israeli efforts to secure the release of hostages and extend humanitarian aid to civilians affected by the war in Israel and Gaza, according to a White House fact sheet released in October.
It would also provide training, equipment and weapons to help Ukraine defend itself against Russia’s invasion and to recapture its territory, as well as to protect Ukrainians from Russian aggression, the fact sheet said.
The package would also include additional funds to support US-Mexico border security, including more patrol agents, machines to detect fentanyl, asylum officers and immigration judge teams. Plus, it would provide funding to strengthen security in the Indo-Pacific region, including Taiwan.

Biden makes the case for wartime aid to Israel and Ukraine in primetime address
President Joe Biden pushed for the funding request in a prime-time Oval Office address to the nation in October. The administration’s prior request for $24 billion in Ukraine aid was not included in a stopgap government funding measure Congress approved in late September.
Here’s what’s in the package, according to the White House:
$61.4 billion in aid for Ukraine
• $30 billion for the Defense Department for equipment for Ukraine and the replenishment of US stocks. So far, the US has provided Ukraine with air defense systems, munitions, small arms and ground maneuver units, among other weapons and equipment.
• $14.4 billion for continued military, intelligence and other defense support. This includes investments in the defense industrial base, transportation costs of US personnel and equipment, and continuing an enhanced US troop presence in Europe, among other activities.
• $16.3 billion for economic, security and operational assistance. It includes direct budget support to Ukraine to help it provide critical services to its people and sustain its economy, as well as investments in infrastructure, civilian law enforcement and getting rid of mines.
• $481 million to support Ukrainians arriving in the US through the Uniting for Ukraine program.
• $149 million for the National Nuclear Security Administration for nuclear/radiological incident response and capacity building in case of emergencies as part of general contingency planning.
RELATED: Ukraine aid: Where the money is coming from, in 4 charts
$14.3 billion in aid for Israel
• $10.6 billion for assistance through the Defense Department, including air and missile defense support, industrial base investments and replenishment of US stocks being drawn down to support Israel.
• The aid aims to bolster Israel’s air and missile defense system readiness and support its procurement of Iron Dome and David’s Sling missile defense systems and components, as well as the development of the Iron Beam.
• $3.7 billion for the State Department to strengthen Israel’s military and enhance US Embassy security.
$10 billion for humanitarian assistance
• $9.15 billion for aid for Ukraine, Israel, Gaza and other humanitarian needs. It includes support for Palestinian refugees in the West Bank and surrounding areas.
• $850 million for migration and refugee assistance at the US-Mexico border.
$7.4 billion for Taiwan and the Indo-Pacific region
• The security assistance aims to bolster deterrence and to support allies facing increasing assertiveness from China and transitioning off Russian military equipment.
• $2 billion for foreign military financing.
• $3.4 billion for the submarine industrial base. It would fund improvements at the Navy’s four public shipyards and increase submarine availability.
• $2 billion for the Treasury Department to provide a “credible alternative to coercive financing” and to catalyze billions from other donors through the US-led World Bank. The administration is seeking to offer options other than China’s “coercive and unsustainable financing for developing countries.”
$13.6 billion to address security at the US-Mexico border
• $6.4 billion for border operations, including additional temporary holding facilities, DNA collection at the border and support for eligible arrivals and unaccompanied children.
• $3.1 billion for an additional 1,300 Border Patrol agents, 1,600 asylum officers, processing personnel and 375 immigration judge teams.
• $1.4 billion for state and local support for temporary shelter, food and other services for migrants recently released from Department of Homeland Security custody.
• $1.2 billion to counter fentanyl, including inspection system deployment, additional Customs and Border Protection officers, and testing and tracing activities.
• $1.4 billion for migration needs to support Safe Mobility Offices, for host communities and legal pathways in the region, for foreign government repatriation operations and to combat human trafficking and smuggling in the Western Hemisphere. 
• $100 million for child labor investigations and enforcement, particularly to protect migrant children entering the US through the southern border.

The US military will fly three planeloads of crucial humanitarian aid to North Sinai in Egypt to be brought into Gaza to aid civilians in the region, according to senior administration officials.
The aid that is being brought will include medical supplies, food and winter weather gear as Gaza enters its rainy season – which can be wet, cold and even lead to flooding – with countless Palestinians displaced in temporary shelters. The first of the three flights is set to arrive Tuesday.
The announcement comes amid a pause in the fighting between Israel and Hamas that has been extended for an additional two days to potentially secure the release of further hostages and allow increased humanitarian aid into Gaza. One official noted that this ongoing effort to help supply civilians is not linked to the ongoing hostage deal and will continue when hostilities ultimately resume.
The aid being flown in by the United States, which officials called a “significant contribution,” will be distributed by the United Nations and replenish stocks of supplies, which had been depleted as the pace of aid being brought into Gaza increased in recent days.
The effort builds upon five previous flights of aid being brought into the region on domestic planes, the officials added.
Administration officials have also been having discussions with the Israeli government over the last few weeks about not just providing basic humanitarian assistance to Gaza but moving to what they described as phase two: Getting commercial goods into Gaza. One of the officials said that the current level of humanitarian aid is not enough, and they need to reach a point where they can provide the sustained delivery of commercial goods in addition to basic humanitarian aid. They added that everyone “from the president on down” understands that what is getting into Gaza is not enough for normal life in the besieged enclave.
During the ongoing humanitarian pause, roughly 800 trucks of aid have entered Gaza, according to the officials. And over the past seven weeks, Biden and senior officials have been working “around the clock” on the humanitarian response, these officials added. This includes working to expand humanitarian access, push for restoration of essential services and secure deconfliction mechanisms for civilian sites and movement in Gaza.
The need for increased assistance is a reality that UN officials have also been emphasizing. United Nations Relief and Works Agency spokesperson Adnan Abu Hasna told CNN Sunday that the current levels of aid are “just a drop in the ocean of humanitarian needs” and that they need more supplies to operate critical services and sectors like sewage, water or hospitals.
Biden’s top national security advisor Jake Sullivan this past weekend detailed some of the steps that are taken in order to bring aid into Gaza.
It’s first brought through the Rafah crossing into Gaza where it is inspected by the Israelis, following which the aid trucks go to United Nations depots and other humanitarian organizations that, he said, are “vetted and trusted partners” after which it is distributed directly to civilians.
“As humanitarian assistance has ramped up, we’ve seen it work – that it’s actually getting to people and that it’s not being diverted into the hands of Hamas. But that’s something that we have to continue to focus on an ongoing basis,” Sullivan said.
In a statement on Monday President Joe Biden highlighted efforts his administration has been taking to surge this additional humanitarian aid into the Gaza strip.
“The United States has led the humanitarian response into Gaza—building on years of work as the largest funder of humanitarian assistance for the Palestinian people,” Biden said. “We are taking full advantage of the pause in fighting to increase the amount of humanitarian aid moving into Gaza, and we will continue our efforts to build a future of peace and dignity for the Palestinian people.”",politics

CIA Director Bill Burns visited Qatar on Tuesday for meetings with Qatari officials as well as his Israeli and Egyptian counterparts to push for a broader hostage deal that would expand beyond women and children to include negotiations for men and soldiers, a source familiar with the talks told CNN.
“Director Burns traveled to Doha for meetings about the ongoing Israel-Hamas war, including continued discussions on the hostages,” a US official said.
Another person familiar with the trip said the CIA director would be joined in Doha by the director of Israel’s intelligence service Mossad, David Barnea, and the Director of Egyptian General Intelligence, Abbas Kamel.
Burns’ trip to Qatar comes after the truce was extended by two days. His latest push is for the talks to expand to include the men who are being held in addition to male and female Israeli soldiers, which would include expanding the temporary pause that is now slated to last six days, a source said.
Israeli officials have publicly acknowledged that it will cost a higher price to get Israeli men and soldiers home. Under the current agreement, three Palestinian prisoners are released for every one hostage that Hamas frees.
The trip comes as Americans are still being held hostage, including two American women eligible for release under the current deal and several more who are men and therefore unlikely to be included. Abigail Edan, the 4-year-old American dual citizen abducted by Hamas on October 7, was released Sunday, marking the first successful release of an American hostage since the start of the truce between Israel and Hamas.
Burns has been a central player in the Biden administration’s effort to negotiate a deal for Hamas to release hostages and has been in regular contact with Barnea, who was designated by the Israelis as the point person for hostage negotiations.
Burns was in Doha on November 9 meeting with Qatari leaders and Barnea to go over the “emerging arrangement,” a senior US administration official said. A week and a half later, Burns was called into a meeting in Doha led by the White House’s top Middle East adviser, Brett McGurk, as the finished touches were being put on the agreement that would see at least 50 hostages released over four days.
The agreement was brokered by Qatar, which served as an intermediary between Hamas and Israel in negotiations with the close involvement of the US.",politics
bbc,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-67557477,"Cabinet minister Michael Gove has disputed claims Boris Johnson was ""incapable of making decisions"" about lockdowns during the pandemic in evidence to the Covid inquiry.
He said introducing a lockdown was ""difficult"" for Mr Johnson because it went against his ""political outlook"".
But he accepted lockdowns came too late both in March and November 2020.
Mr Gove also apologised to victims and bereaved families for the government's ""mistakes"" during the pandemic.
He said as a senior minister who was ""close to many of the decisions that were made, I must take my share of responsibility for that"".
Mr Gove said politicians were ""human beings"" who were ""fallible"", and ""every decision was difficult and every course was bad"" at the time.
Personal responsibility
While some mistakes were ""unique and specific to the UK government"", Mr Gove said ""we need to remember that governments everywhere made errors"".
Mr Gove was the first senior cabinet minister at the centre of the UK government's response to the pandemic to give evidence in this part of the inquiry.
As cabinet office minister he was part of a core team of key decision makers in 2020 along with Mr Johnson, former Health Secretary Matt Hancock and Rishi Sunak, who was chancellor and is now prime minister.
His admission to errors and his own personal responsibility at the time was a significant moment in the inquiry, as well as his apology to bereaved families.

• Read the private WhatsApp messages from inside Downing Street

Much of Mr Gove's testimony focused on how decisions were made by senior ministers and civil servants in Mr Johnson's government in the first year of the pandemic.
In previous testimony, some of Mr Johnson's most senior advisers - including Dominic Cummings and Lee Cain - have characterised the former prime minister as indecisive and liable to change his mind.
Lee Cain, No 10's former director of communications, said Mr Johnson had been ""torn"" between the scientific evidence and public opinion, describing the pandemic as the ""wrong crisis"" for the former prime minister.
But in his testimony on Tuesday, Mr Gove was loath to criticise his former cabinet colleagues.
When asked about the lockdown announced by Mr Johnson in March 2020, Mr Gove said: ""A decision to restrict freedoms in an unprecedented way went against his instincts and the principles that governed his political outlook.""
The levelling up secretary said Mr Johnson preferred ""gladiatorial decision-making"" and wanted to see opposing arguments ""rehearsed in front of him"".
Mr Gove also said he had a ""high opinion of Matt Hancock and believe many of the decisions he made displayed foresight and wisdom"". 
Mr Hancock is due to begin his evidence to the inquiry on Thursday, with Mr Johnson and Mr Sunak to appear before Christmas.
Mr Gove told the inquiry ministers like himself who believed the government should have acted earlier had a responsibility to point out to the then-prime minister the need for action.
""I don't think that one can single out the prime minister at the time for criticism,"" Mr Gove said. ""We all deserve our share retrospectively of criticism.""
Admissions of failure
The senior Conservative MP said the UK was not well enough prepared for the pandemic, that testing should have been better planned and that there were errors with PPE procurement. 
He acknowledged there was not enough focus on the impact on children.
In a foul-mouthed WhatsApp exchange with Mr Cummings at the beginning of the pandemic, Mr Gove said the government was ""missing golden opportunities"" to act.
He wrote: ""I will carry on doing what I can but the whole situation is even worse than you think and action needs to be taken or we will regret it for a long time.""
When asked to expand on his comments, Mr Gove said at the time he was concerned about the ""ability and structure"" of the Cabinet Office to deliver government's priorities.
He then apologised for his language and added he feared the ""weaknesses"" in government would be further exposed by Covid.
At one point, the Surrey Heath MP noted there was a significant body of evidence that believes Covid was ""man-made"", only to be told the issue was not part of the inquiry's terms of reference.
Where and how the Covid virus originated is still a matter of intense scientific debate.
One controversial school of thought - which has been described as a ""likely"" explanation by the FBI - is that the virus was accidentally leaked by a Chinese laboratory which was researching similar viruses.
When asked about Mr Gove's comments, the prime minister's spokesperson said the World Health Organisation ""needs to continue to examine all possibilities"" about the origins of Covid.
Former deputy chief medical officer Professor Dame Jenny Harries is due to give evidence later on Tuesday.
Later this week, the inquiry will also take evidence from Mr Hancock and the former Deputy Prime Minister Dominic Raab.
The inquiry is taking evidence as part of its second module on core UK decision-making and political governance.",politics
bbc,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-67551732,"No. 10 is embroiled in a deepening row with Athens after cancelling a meeting between Rishi Sunak and the Greek PM. 
Downing Street believed it had assurances that Kyriakos Mitsotakis would not speak publicly about the Parthenon Sculptures - also known as the Elgin Marbles - on his UK visit. 
A Greek source has denied this.
On Sunday, Greece's leader told the BBC that having some of the treasures in London and others in Athens was like cutting the Mona Lisa in half.
No. 10 then scrapped the PM's meeting with Mr Mitsotakis at late notice.
Labour has described the row as ""petty"" and ""small-minded"".
A Greek government source disputed there had been any assurances given to the UK over Mr Mitsotakis talking about the marbles while he was in the country. 
They said discussions preparing for the meeting with the UK PM had been smooth until late afternoon on Monday - long after Mr Mitsotakis's BBC interview with Laura Kuenssberg on Sunday.
The sculptures are a collection of ancient Greek treasures from the Parthenon in Athens which were taken and brought to the UK by British diplomat Lord Elgin in the early 19th Century.
They have been in the British Museum since 1832, aside from a stint in Aldwych Tube station during World War Two to prevent damage and one marble being loaned to a Russian museum in 2014.
Both Greece and the UK have long-standing positions on the sculptures, but diplomatic talks were expected to focus on other topics. 
Transport Secretary Mark Harper told BBC Breakfast on Tuesday it was a ""matter of regret"" that no meeting would take place between the two countries after Mr Mitsotakis declined a secondary offer to meet Deputy Prime Minister Oliver Dowden instead. 
Asked whether the government's treatment of the Greek leader was rude, Mr Harper said the Greeks had been offered a senior-level meeting but were entitled to take their own view. 
• Sculptures row about politics as much as history
• How did the Elgin Marbles get here?
• What will be the fate of the Parthenon Sculptures?
• Elgin Marbles statue lent to Russia
• What are the Elgin Marbles?
A Greek minister branded the row a ""bad day"" for British-Greek relations.
Adonis Georgiadis told BBC Radio 4's World at One programme that Mr Sunak's decision had been a ""mistake"". 
Stressing his ""huge respect"" for the British people and the two countries' friendship, the minister of labour and social insurance said: ""What [the Greek PM] mentioned in his interview is not just his own opinion, it is the single one opinion of 11 million Greek people."" 
Professor Irene Stamatoudi, a former member of the advisory committee for the Greek Minister of Culture, said the row ""makes Rishi Sunak look no better than Lord Elgin"" - and accused that diplomat of smuggling artefacts ""to decorate his country house in Scotland"".
She told Today it was ""not possible"" for the Greek PM not to respond to questions about the Parthenon Sculptures.
Mr Sunak is keen to be seen as a defender of the marbles' place in London. A senior Conservative source said: ""Our position is clear - the Elgin Marbles are part of the permanent collection of the British Museum and belong here.""
Later on Tuesday, the PM's official spokesman told reporters Mr Sunak had decided it would ""not be productive"" to hold the meeting.
He said that when the meeting was requested ""the Greek government provided reassurances that they would not use the visit as a public platform to relitigate long-settled matters relating to the ownership of the Parthenon Sculptures"" - arguing those assurances were then ""not adhered to"".
Mr Mitsotakis had told reporters on Monday evening he was ""deeply disappointed by the abrupt cancellation"" of the talks, which had been planned for Tuesday lunchtime.
Sources with knowledge of the mood in the Greek government have suggested Mr Mitsotakis was both ""baffled"" and ""annoyed"".

In his interview with Laura Kuenssberg the day before, the Greek PM had called for the sculptures to be returned. 
He said they were ""essentially stolen"" and called for a partnership with the British Museum so people could ""appreciate"" the works ""in their original setting"". 
Mr Mitsotakis met Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer on Monday and will return to Greece later after other scheduled meetings. 
On Tuesday morning, Greek government spokesperson Pavlos Marinakis told SKAI TV that ""Britain's attitude shows no respect for the prime minister and our country"".
He added that although cancelling a meeting was not ""common"", the Greek government did not want ""to escalate the issue with a country with which we have good relations."" 
There is an ongoing wider debate around the place of museums and their collections in a post-colonial world, with Mr Sunak seemingly positioning himself decisively on one side of that argument.

Lord Vaizey, who chairs the advisory board of the Parthenon Project dedicated to returning the Elgin Marbles to Greece, told the Today programme it was ""odd"" for the PM to cancel the meeting.
The ex-culture minister said: ""It is tied up to a certain extent in the traditional culture wars, where anyone who dares to say that British history wasn't perfect is somehow unpatriotic.
""The trouble with that is that, from what I can gather, every opinion poll that surveys the British public says that they do think that the sculptures should be returned.""
Thangam Debbonaire, Labour's shadow culture secretary, said it was ""petty"" and ""small-minded"" to cancel the meeting, and called Mr Sunak ""reckless"".
""To have decided to create division where none needed to be seems to me to be not just reckless but actually potentially really damaging to our international reputation,"" she added.

Instead, the party says its position is that if the British Museum and the Greek government came to a loan agreement, a Labour government would not stand in the way. 
A spokesperson for the UK government said there were ""no plans"" to change the 1963 British Museum Act - which prohibits the removal of objects from the institution's collection.
But a loan does not require a change in the law and so could happen irrespective of any PM's position.
Unesco, a UN agency which was established to promote world peace and security through cooperation on arts and culture, has told the BBC it ""stands ready"" to broker an agreement between the UK and Greece, ""if they express the desire for such support"". 
What are the Parthenon Sculptures, also known as the Elgin Marbles? 
• Friezes and pediment figures which decorated the Parthenon temple in Athens, built 447-432 BC
• The Marbles taken to Britain include about a half (some 75 metres) of the sculpted frieze that once ran all round the building, plus 17 life-sized marble figures
• Most of the surviving sculptures are roughly equally divided between London and Athens
• The new Acropolis Museum opened in Athens in 2009. It is designed to display all the surviving sculptures, in their original layout
• Celebrities previously involved in the campaign for their return include the late actress and former Greek Culture Minister Melina Mercouri 
• Art lover Lord Elgin claimed the sculptures were better off in Britain than the then-dilapidated Parthenon
• In 1801, he negotiated what he claimed was permission from the Ottoman Empire - which then controlled Athens - to remove statues from the classical temple built by the Ancient Greeks - and caused some damage to the ruin in doing so
• Fragments from the Parthenon alone ended up in some 10 European countries, or were lost altogether",politics

Rishi Sunak was due to meet Greece's Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis at lunchtime for a 45-minute get together.
On the face of it, they have plenty to discuss: Israel and Gaza; the war in Ukraine; migration.
Just a few weeks ago, the then Home Secretary Suella Braverman - before being sacked - visited the Greek island of Samos, and said the UK had ""a lot to learn"" from the country on dealing with illegal immigration.
But enter now a row about heritage. A row about culture.
A row about what is British and belongs in Britain - and what doesn't.
Sunak cancels Greek PM meeting in Parthenon Sculptures row
Mr Mitsotakis had indicated he would use the meeting to call for the return of the Parthenon Sculptures - or Elgin Marbles - from the British Museum to Athens.
Sir Keir Starmer met the Greek prime minister on Monday.
The get-together itself is enough to annoy some in government - foreign prime ministers meeting opposition leaders rarely goes down well with their actual opposite numbers.
And with Labour consistently miles ahead in the opinion polls, meetings like this are likely to become more frequent.
Labour said Mr Sunak's decision to cancel his meeting with the Greek prime minister was ""pathetic.""
But at the heart of this diplomatic spat is a very domestic political row about a difference of instinct between the Conservatives and Labour on the future of the marbles.
Sir Keir would not oppose a temporary loan of the sculptures to Greece if it was agreed by the British Museum and Athens.

Such a deal does not require a change in the law and could be months away from agreement.
It is opposed by the Conservatives, who say it would be reckless. They are fearful the sculptures would never be returned.
The Greek prime minister is baffled and annoyed at being stood up.
He suggested to Greek reporters travelling with him that Mr Sunak was a coward.
""Anyone who believes in the rightness and fairness of his positions is never afraid of confrontation,"" he said.
Having been rejected by Mr Sunak, the Greek leader was instead offered a meeting with the Deputy Prime Minister Oliver Dowden.

• UK politics live – latest updates

Workers in some public sector jobs will be completely prevented from striking under restrictive rules that may breach international law, parliament’s watchdog on human rights has said.
The joint committee on human rights, chaired by the Labour MP Harriet Harman, has written to the government expressing “serious concerns” about its new minimum service levels regulations covering the border force, railways and the NHS.
The letter to Kemi Badenoch, the business secretary, was published as the government prepares to set out new regulations that will also cover teachers, forcing unions to maintain a certain level of staffing in schools during strikes.
The laws have been brought in after a huge wave of strikes last year as workers protested against below-inflation pay rises – and in many cases forced the government to pay out more.
In its letter, the joint committee said the government had failed to allay widespread concerns about whether the anti-strike legislation was compatible with human rights law.
“Particular concerns arise in respect of small ports and airports, where ‘no less effective’ services [in the border force] could result in staff teams being effectively prevented from striking at all,” the committee of MPs and peers said.
For those working on railway services, the regulations say that 40% of passenger services must be maintained. However, those working in infrastructure services such as signalling would have to provide cover between 6am and 10pm on a substantial number of “priority routes”, which the committee said “gave rise to a risk that employees working in infrastructure on those lines would be effectively prevented from striking”.
The MPs and peers said they recognised that the right to take industrial action was not absolute and may be interfered with where necessary and proportionate in the public interest. But it said the measures were “unlikely to be proportionate if alternative, less restrictive measures could be taken that are likely to achieve the same aims”.
They added: “A failure to pursue voluntary arrangements where they are recognised to be sufficient is unlikely to meet this requirement of proportionality.”
The government is also consulting on minimum service levels to cover health workers, but NHS Providers recently warned that the legislation could worsen industrial relations and harm care.
Paul Nowak, general secretary of the TUC, said: “These anti-strike laws are a deliberate attempt to restrict the right to strike – a fundamental British liberty. They are undemocratic, unworkable and likely illegal. And crucially they will poison industrial relations and exacerbate disputes rather than help resolve them.”
A Department for Business and Trade spokesperson said: “The minimum service legislation is compatible with all our international obligations – many members of the EU already have minimum service levels legislation in place covering a broad range of services.
“We’ve been clear that there needs to be a reasonable balance between the right of workers to strike and the rights of the public, who work hard and expect essential services that they pay for to be there when needed.”",politics
the_guardian,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/nov/28/michael-gove-apologises-for-mistakes-by-government-during-covid-crisis,"Michael Gove has apologised for mistakes made by the government during the Covid pandemic, saying the UK was too slow to lock down in early 2020 and then again that autumn.
Gove told the Covid inquiry the initial delay was not because of dithering by Boris Johnson, saying that the then prime minister needed time to “reflect on the momentous nature of the decision and consider arguments against it”.
However, he did agree that by mid-March 2020, when he was personally convinced about the need for a lockdown, he should have been more forthright. Asked by Hugo Keith KC, the inquiry counsel, whether this was by then a matter of life and death, Gove replied: “Absolutely. And that is why I believe I should have been [clearer].”
Gove, who was the lead minister in the Cabinet Office for much of the pandemic, said the initial approach to testing for the virus was chaotic, not enough focus was paid to the impact of lockdown on children, and there was a need for “reflection” on how PPE was procured.
While evidence showed Gove was pushing for earlier action, he declined to blame Johnson for being cautious about the first lockdown, saying this was difficult for the PM given his naturally libertarian philosophy.
Quizzed by Keith about earlier evidence on Johnson’s apparent inability to make a decision or to stick with one, Gove denied that the prime minister was “oscillating” during the crucial period in March 2020.
“No. On this occasion I think it was a reluctance to make a decision rather than an inability to stick to one,” he said.
He rejected the wider idea of endemic dysfunction in Johnson’s government or in the Cabinet Office, arguing that the “strong personalities” present also achieved some successes.
Asked about what Keith called “chaos” in the Cabinet Office in early 2020, Gove said: “If I may … apologise to the victims who endured such pain, the families who endured so much loss as a result of the mistakes that were made by government in response to the pandemic.
“As a minister responsible for the Cabinet Office, and was also close to many of the decisions that were made, I must take my share of responsibility for that. Politicians are human beings. We’re fallible. We make mistakes and we make errors. I am sure that the inquiry will have an opportunity to look in detail at many of the errors I and others made.”
Pressed on what specifically went wrong, Gove insisted any errors had to be seen in context. “Of course mistakes were made by the UK government, and some were unique and specific to the UK government. But governments everywhere made errors,” he said.
Pressed on this later in the hearing, Gove said the UK was too slow to lock down initially and that ministers should have taken stronger measures sooner in autumn 2020 as case rates rose again.
The strategy on testing for Covid was “not as rigorously thought through as it might have been”, Gove added, and there was insufficient focus on children, especially vulnerable ones. Finally, he said, the approach to PPE procurement “deserves at the very least reflection”.
The inquiry also saw WhatsApp messages in early March 2020 between Gove and Dominic Cummings, Johnson’s then chief aide in which Gove expressed anger at the slowness of action.
In one message to Cummings on 4 March, Gove wrote: “We are fucking up as a government and missing golden opportunities … the whole situation is even worse than you think and action needs to be taken or we’ll regret it for a long time.”
While Gove said this was about wider issues, not just Covid, by a week later he was agreeing with Cummings that the Cabinet Office was “a fucking joke” because they did not have a promised plan for the pandemic.
“People should be shot,” Cummings said. “Who did you envisage first in line?” Gove asked in reply.
Gove told the hearing that the Cabinet Office, the coordinating department in government, of which he took charge in February 2020, became dysfunctional over time in a “piecemeal and cumulative way” by having more and more responsibilities added.",politics
financial_times,https://www.ft.com/content/b5d91bce-4e36-427a-8fbd-00764bfa3460,"In the 1920s, the Canadian politician Raoul Dandurand described the country as a “fireproof house” — surrounded on three sides by the Pacific, Arctic and Atlantic oceans, and with a friendly neighbour in the US to the south.  It is a comforting view of the world that has helped define Canada’s identity, even as it sent soldiers overseas to fight, from the second world war to Afghanistan.  But that sense of detachment from the harsh realities of geopolitics is rapidly disappearing. Canada has found itself sucked into a series of perilous foreign policy dilemmas that have left it struggling to balance its values, interests and identity. In particular, Canada now finds itself at loggerheads with both India and China — the two most populous nations and the rising powers of this century. Over the past year alone, Canada has accused China of interfering in its domestic politics and criticised the Chinese military for flying dangerously close to its aircraft over the South China Sea. At loggerheads: Chinese leader Xi Jinping speaks with Justin Trudeau at the G20 summit in Bali last year © Adam Scotti/Prime Minister’s Office/Reuters In a vivid illustration of the shifts, Chinese leader Xi Jinping scolded Justin Trudeau, Canada’s prime minister, at the G20 in Bali last year. In a remarkable exchange caught on video, the Chinese president accused a shell-shocked Trudeau of having leaked the contents of a private conversation. Most dramatically, Trudeau stunned the world in September by saying Ottawa was investigating “credible allegations” of Indian government involvement in the fatal shooting of a Canadian Sikh in Vancouver. “The tectonic plates of the world order are shifting,” Mélanie Joly, foreign minister, said in a speech in October. “Our location on the globe — surrounded by three oceans — can no longer be relied upon to protect us.” Canada is a dramatic example of the question that many midsized democracies are now confronting: how to conduct a foreign policy that is consistent with their political identity at a time when authoritarian governments are gaining influence and when economic power and opportunity is shifting more and more to Asia — most notably China and India.  Roland Paris, a foreign policy expert at the University of Ottawa, says Canadians are becoming increasingly aware that foreign policy issues could have a direct impact on their lives. As a member of Nato, Canada was engaged in Afghanistan for years and now is dealing with the Russian invasion of Ukraine. “The idea that Canada is a fireproof house was never accurate, but now it is totally outdated,” says Paris. Mélanie Joly, Canada’s foreign minister: ‘Our location on the globe — surrounded by three oceans — can no longer be relied upon to protect us’ © Christinne Muschi/Bloomberg As the G7’s relative share of global economic power falls, Canada can rely less on membership of such groups to insulate itself from outside pressures. Canadian Senator Peter Boehm, the chair of the foreign affairs committee, earlier told the Financial Times that countries such as India and China were more likely to bully a country like Canada given that it is much less powerful than the US. “If a larger country wants to make an example of a country, Canada is an easy mark,” says Boehm. In an interview with the FT, Joly says she was not explicitly referring to Dandurand when she argued Canada’s location was no longer enough to protect the country. Instead, she was pointing to new risks facing the country, such as cyber and digital-related threats, including the use of artificial intelligence to facilitate political interference. One of the new threats — the possibility of an extraterritorial killing by Indian government agents in Canada — returned to the limelight last week when the FT revealed that the US had warned India over a thwarted plot to kill a Sikh separatist on American soil that it believed had possible Indian government involvement. Jonathan Berkshire Miller, an Indo-Pacific expert at the Macdonald-Laurier Institute think-tank in Ottawa, says that successive governments have tended to treat foreign policy as a “luxury item” and have left it to the Americans to “step up to the plate”, or the Japanese and Australians in the Indo-Pacific. “We’ve had this complacency on foreign security issues for several years,” says Berkshire Miller. Long deep freeze The spat with India over the murder of Hardeep Singh Nijjar, a member of a separatist movement pushing for the creation of an independent Sikh state in India, is a stark example of how power relations are shifting in the world. Last month, Joly revealed that Ottawa had been forced to withdraw 41 diplomats from India after New Delhi vowed to strip them of their diplomatic immunity — a threat that Ottawa said violated formal diplomatic conventions. But the fracas with India came as Canadian engagement with China has still to recover from a long deep freeze. Relations between the countries plummeted in 2018 when China detained two Canadian citizens — Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor, who became known as the “two Michaels” — for more than three years. Michael Kovrig, second from right, and Michael Spavor, right, react as President Joe Biden acknowledges them during a speech to the Canadian parliament earlier this year © Andrew Harnik/Pool/AFP/Getty Images Their detention was widely seen as retaliation for Canada detaining Meng Wanzhou, chief financial officer of Chinese telecoms company Huawei, in connection with a US extradition request. The two Canadians were freed in 2021 as part of an exchange after Meng signed a deferred prosecution deal. In another example of foreign threats at home, Canada this year expelled a Chinese diplomat for alleged political interference. Canadian intelligence said he was involved in a campaign to intimidate an opposition lawmaker with family in Hong Kong who had slammed China on human rights. The case followed leaks to the media about internal warnings the Canadian Security Intelligence Service had issued to the government about the case, which sparked criticism that Trudeau had not taken the issue seriously enough.

Detention of the ‘two Michaels’ was widely seen as retaliation for detaining Meng in connection with a US extradition request © Don Mackinnon/AFP/Getty Images In a rare move for a security agency that hides in the shadows even more than some of its western peers, CSIS head David Vigneault recently joined FBI director Christopher Wray and their counterparts from the UK, Australia and New Zealand — the other members of the Five Eyes intelligence-sharing network — in San Francisco to issue a public warning about China conducting unprecedented levels of espionage to steal cutting-edge technologies. Joly says Canada will deal with the changing landscape and its new threats by relying on two principles. First, Ottawa will strongly defend its sovereignty amid rising global security threats. And second, it will use “pragmatic diplomacy”, which she defines as engaging nations with different perspectives to Canada in an effort to help prevent international conflicts. “We’re going through an international security crisis and so [we’re] explaining to Canadians more than ever that we need to embrace pragmatic diplomacy,” Joly argues. “I’d say that is realpolitik.” To illustrate the first principle, Ottawa is stepping up its presence in the Indo-Pacific, where Joly says that “for too long, Canada was not seen as a reliable partner”. In addition to raising defence spending, Canada is boosting its diplomatic and military presence in the region. For example, Canada’s navy now operates three ships in the Indo-Pacific, which she says is a strong signal of commitment to allies. US Navy guided-missile destroyer USS Chung-Hoon sails alongside the Royal Canadian Navy frigate HMCS Montreal during operations in the South China Sea in May © US Navy/Naval Air Crewman (Helicopter) 1st Class Dalton Cooper/Handout/Reuters Canadian naval ships have also joined the US in transiting the Taiwan Strait, in “freedom of navigation” operations designed to send a message to Beijing as it increasingly challenges America and its allies in the South China Sea. In one example of Canada taking a public stand, it recently accused the Chinese military of reckless activity after a fighter jet fired flares near one of its military helicopters over the South China Sea. Yet Ottawa has at other times been reluctant to speak out. Earlier this year, the US asked Canada to make public the details of another dangerous incident that involved a Chinese fighter jet, but Ottawa declined, according to people familiar with the case. “The Indo-Pacific strategy had a clear message on China that has not changed. But our diplomacy — how we deal with China and others — now has to take into account the need for pragmatism,” says Vina Nadjibulla, vice-president of research and strategy at the Asia Pacific Foundation of Canada. Looking to Australia Nadjibulla says that includes the need to stabilise relations with China and have a more constructive dialogue with the country, as the US and Australia have recently been doing. Anthony Albanese recently became the first Australian prime minister to visit China in seven years, in a trip that eased tensions in what has been a frosty relationship, particularly since his predecessor called for an investigation into China and the Covid-19 pandemic. “Australia has demonstrated how you can stabilise relations with China while not giving up on your principles and values,” Nadjibulla adds. Canadian diplomats are also watching closely as the US tries to stabilise relations with China, which had plummeted to their lowest level since they established diplomatic ties in 1979. President Joe Biden and his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping met in San Francisco on November 15 for a summit that produced a slight thaw. Asked whether “pragmatic diplomacy” would include engagement with India and China, Joly says it will. The spat between Canada and India continues two months after Trudeau’s bombshell claim. But earlier this month there was a nascent sign of better relations when India resumed the electronic processing of visas for Canadians, which was halted after the crisis erupted. Improving relations with India is particularly important for Canada given that 1.3mn people in the country — or 4 per cent of the population — claim Indian heritage. Despite the public rhetoric between the two capitals, Canada and India have continued discussions in private. Justin Trudeau and his Indian counterpart Narendra Modi take part in a wreath-laying ceremony at Raj Ghat, Mahatma Gandhi’s cremation site, during the G20 summit in New Delhi in September © Sean Kilpatrick/AP The FT previously revealed that Joly and Indian foreign minister S Jaishankar held a secret meeting in Washington in late September. But while Canada has maintained dialogue with India, the situation with China is more complicated. Joly tells the FT it is “definitely a priority of mine” to engage China. Pressed on whether she would travel to China at some point, she responds: “It’s important that I be able to go to different countries . . . including China.” Philippe Rheault, a recently retired Canadian diplomat who spent much of his career focused on, and working in, China, says Beijing is ready to re-engage but is “somewhat bemused” by the reluctance in Ottawa. “In Canada, there’s a lot of scarring from the ‘Two Michaels’ episode and a sense that China used coercive behaviour,” says Rheault, who heads the China Institute at the University of Alberta. “That combined with low favourability ratings for China in Canada makes Canadian officials wary of engagement.” Another former Canadian diplomat says the Michaels case was a “searing, traumatising experience” for Canadians because the pair had almost iconic status as personifications of a “big country trying to bully a small country”. In September, Trudeau appeared to play down the prospects of a detente with Beijing. He said there would be “no” rapprochement because Chinese actions had made that “more difficult”. Two weeks ago, Trudeau had a brief exchange with Xi as they gathered for a group photo at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum in San Francisco immediately after Biden’s summit with the Chinese leader. Trudeau said he told Xi their teams should try to have “constructive dialogue”. In language that alluded to “pragmatic diplomacy”, he said it was “part of the ongoing engagement that Canada needs to have . . . including with countries we disagree with”. But Lynette Ong, a Canada-China expert at the University of Toronto, says Trudeau’s hands are “really tied” now because the opposition Conservative party is pressuring him to be tough on China. The prime minister is running for a fourth term in a general election that must be held by 2025 but faces increasingly bad public polling numbers. Regardless of whether Canada reboots its engagement with Beijing, Ong says that Canada has to do more if it is really serious about stepping up its presence in the Indo-Pacific. Other countries in Asia have privately expressed interest in joining the Quad, a security group consisting of the US, Japan, Australia and India. Protesters outside the Indian consulate in Toronto last month. The spat over the murder of Hardeep Singh Nijjar, a member of a separatist movement pushing for the creation of an independent Sikh state in India, shows how global power relations are shifting © Arlyn McAdorey/Bloomberg Some are also keen to join Aukus, an Australia-UK-US pact that is primarily designed to enable Canberra to procure nuclear-propelled submarines, but has a separate pillar focused on developing advanced technologies such as hypersonic weapons. “Unless we get our act together, beef up our security and defence and somehow figure out a way to get invited to join Aukus and the Quad . . . the tough position on China is going to be mostly rhetoric,” says Ong. Joly declines to say if Canada is interested in joining Aukus. Ottawa is already part of what she calls the “most compelling architecture in the Indo-Pacific” — a reference to CPTPP, a massive Pacific trade deal that was resurrected from the TPP agreement that Donald Trump jettisoned in 2017. Michael Kovrig, now a senior Asia adviser at the International Crisis Group, says one problem Canada faces is that it has been “sheltered” as other western countries have been adapting to an evolving geopolitical order. “Canadians aren’t used to thinking geopolitically,” he says. “But that’s going to be essential for the country to protect itself, maintain influence, and prosper in an increasingly complex and hostile world.” Berkshire Miller says Canada has, however, put muscle behind its rhetoric in terms of relations with Japan and South Korea, which he says is the most concrete part of the country’s Indo-Pacific strategy, which was unveiled last year. Ottawa has had serious discussions with Tokyo and Seoul on issues such as critical minerals to energy security. The country also participates in a multilateral effort to monitor North Korean compliance with UN sanctions. For now, Ottawa must grapple with how to approach China and India. But Vincent Rigby, a former national security adviser to Trudeau, says a broader and longer-term critical question is whether Ottawa is responding seriously enough to the rapid decline in the international security order. “Canada has been a bit of bystander. It has taken measures, but not always in a systematically planned way. We haven’t had a comprehensive foreign policy strategy since 2005 or a national security policy since 2004,” says Rigby, who now works at McGill University. “We are lacking a bit of strategic direction in a world that is being buffeted by change.” Canada also faces a potentially very turbulent situation on the horizon — the possible re-election of Trump, whose first term in the White House sparked a marked deterioration in relations between Canada and its closest ally. In interviews in Ottawa, multiple officials and foreign policy experts say Canada is fretting about the prospect of Trump. When pressed on how the country was preparing for that possibility, Joly is extremely diplomatic. “We’ve been always able to work with the administration of the day. The US is our most important ally and best friend.”  ",politics
financial_times,https://www.ft.com/content/5c88b523-9312-4057-948b-0f0ac625725d,"Three recent columns asked whether China’s rapid rise in relative gross domestic product and GDP per head was coming to an end, as many believe (or hope). The first argued that China had the potential for rapid growth because it was still so poor: according to the IMF, China’s GDP per head was only 76th in the world in 2022. The second considered the biggest domestic economic problem — chronic excess savings absorbed in an unsustainable debt-fuelled real estate boom that is coming to an end. The third considered the constraints imposed by a falling population. The conclusion was that these were serious, but manageable, difficulties. This leaves us with the biggest constraint of all, which is politics. Abroad, China needs to navigate around the rising hostility of the US and its allies. At home, it needs to manage the shift to a more balanced economy and sustain the relationship between the communist state and the capitalist economy. These challenges are the most difficult the rising giant faces. If it fails to manage them, it could, at worst, end up in conflict with the high-income democracies and, at best, be another country caught in the “middle-income trap”. It is hard to assess how significant a constraint on growth the deteriorating external environment will prove to be. This is partly because we do not know how much worse it might get. It is also because some of what might happen is not the result of any specific policy choices by the US or other governments, but rather of a more general anxiety in foreign businesses over the various risks that exposure to China could entail. The trade policy actions introduced under Donald Trump and continued under Joe Biden have had no significant effect on China’s overall trade. In 2022, it ran substantial trade surpluses with every big economic region, including North America. Its ratio of trade to GDP has fallen, but is still high for such a large economy. Its share of world exports has stopped rising. But it is still far higher than those of the EU (excluding internal trade) or the US. Lack of export earnings will not stop China from buying what it needs. Most suppliers will also be happy to sell to it. The obvious exception is due to US restrictions on exports of semiconductors and the capacity to make them. According to Tilly Zhang of Gavekal: “China’s semiconductor industry is coming to terms with an unpleasant reality: at this point, co-ordinated sanctions by the US and its allies have effectively blocked its path to making advanced chips.” But more broadly, suggests Thomas Gatley, also of Gavekal, the “main impact of the trade and technology war and its associated tariffs and controls has not been to cut US dependence on Chinese goods, but to make supply chains more intricate and opaque”. The big question then is whether restrictions on technology will prove a binding constraint on the performance of the economy. I do not know, but I am sceptical. Chinese people are very innovative and entrepreneurial. The big issue is whether these qualities are allowed to flourish. Is it possible for “capitalist communism” to survive politically and flourish economically, or will what Marxists might call its “contradictions” tear it apart? Indeed, are they tearing it apart now, under Xi Jinping’s rule? Deng Xiaoping was a pragmatic (and ruthless) genius. He allowed the Chinese economy to become open, dynamic and remarkably free. Not hankering for day-to-day control, he was happy to delegate power to competent people. But, since there could be no constraints on the discretion of the party-state, getting things done depended on deals between officials and business. That led to a great deal of corruption. Xi has told us so. World Bank governance indicators show he was right. China is indeed corrupt by the standards of high-income democracies. Xi is also no delegator. He is instead cementing his power in the party and the party’s power in the country. Meanwhile (and appropriately), objectives and constraints have become more complex. It is impossible to focus only on growth. National security, the environment and inequality also matter, to name a few issues. All this makes policymaking far more difficult. Not least, there are also sudden shocks, notably Covid, where a successful policy of suppression lasted far too long. This last, suggests Adam Posen of the Peterson Institute for International Economics, ended the “no politics, no problem” bargain, in which the economy functioned freely so long as people stayed out of politics. Today, however, policy has become less predictable and more intrusive. Yet this is not the product of Xi’s whims alone. The issue is far deeper. In the end, the party’s marriage to a market economy risks undermining both its legitimacy and its control. Xi’s desire to restore both inevitably undermines Deng’s great achievement, which is China’s economic dynamism. All this has become even more problematic, now that the external environment is so challenging and the economy so much in need of rebalancing and reform. Recommended Chinese economy Martin Wolf: The economic future of China The biggest questions about China’s economic future then are political. How will its relationship with the US and its own governance evolve? A big domestic question is whether there is the will and capacity to shift the economy away from its dependence on excessive and wasteful investment towards higher consumption and better investment. The still greater question is whether China has passed the point at which the relationship between the Communist party and capitalism works. If not, which ends up on top? If, as seems probable, it is the centralised party under the direction of one man, can the market economy thrive?",politics

Kuperberg and Shumer are among list makers on the 2024 Forbes 30 Under 30 Consumer Tech list, which identifies and highlights young entrepreneurs making an impact through consumer technology.
For more than a decade, Forbes has highlighted young tech entrepreneurs, researchers and tech executives for our annual 30 Under 30 Consumer Tech list. To be considered for this year’s list, all candidates had to be under the age of 30 as of December 31, 2024 and never before named to an 30 Under 30 North America, Asia or Europe list.
This year’s list is derived from hundreds of nominations and online submissions from a range of sources as well as outreach and research conducted by list editors. Candidates were evaluated by a panel of judges featuring Uttara Sivaram, Under 30 alumna and privacy expert; Steve Jang, founder of early stage VC firm Kindred Ventures; Stephanie Marrus, the managing director of entrepreneurship at the University of California San Francisco (UCSF); and Dave Salvant, cofounder of barbershop booking app Squire, which is valued at $750 million.
One thing this year’s listmakers highlight are the number of different areas that are being influenced by AI. Making investments is another task being automated thanks to Eve Halimi, 27, and Anam Lakhani, 26, cofounders of AI-based investment app Alinea Invest, which expects to book $1.2 million in 2023 revenue. More than 200,000 GenZ’ers use the platform to learn more about investing and create and manage their investment portfolios. At Toronto-based startup Tempo Labs, 28-year-old cofounders Peter Gokhshteyn and Kevin Michael are building tools that let people enter text-based prompts to generate and edit code to create web pages and apps. “Our AI provides non-technical people the ability to generate high-quality code without engineering skills,” Gokhshteyn says.

Product designer-turned-entrepreneur Jordan Singer, 28, founded AI design startup Diagram that gained steam among its 100,000 users before being acquired by $20 billion design giant Figma in 2023. Even education stands to be disrupted by AI, says Jagriti Agrawal, 28, cofounder of Kira Learning, a computer science learning platform that uses AI to detect mistakes in students’ code. Valued at $75 million, Kira Learning has booked $2.5 million in revenue so far this year.
Other founders featured on the list are finding traction by building tools that detect AI-generated text and images. As text-to-image based AI tools became popular, Chicago-based Ph.D. researchers and Glaze cofounders Emily Wenger, 29, Shawn Shan, 26, and Jenna Cryan, 29, developed tools to protect artists from their work being scraped and used in AI training datasets without their consent. The tools have been used by more than a million artists. Further, to detect text written by conversational AI chatbots like ChatGPT, Edward Tian, 23 and Alexander Cui, 25 built GPTZero out of their dorm room. The tool quickly went viral and today has 1.5 million registered users ranging from teachers to journalists.
Beyond AI, cofounders are using technology to address key and often overlooked social issues. Vedant Pradeep, 27, is the CEO and cofounder of alcohol reduction app Reframe, which booked $13 million in revenue in 2022 and is currently valued at $350 million. Max Mayblum, 29, launched Givers, a platform that helps 15,000 caregivers get paid each month through enrollment in programs. And immigrant entrepreneurs Caleb Lee, 28, Timothy Makalinao, 27, and Larry Zhang, 27, cofounded job search platform Bandana, which has a goal of offering transparency into hourly-wage jobs.
These are only a few of the incredible listmakers on this year’s Forbes 30 Under 30 Consumer Tech list. Be sure to read up on all of them, plus all of the other 30 Under 30 2024 categories.

financial_times,https://www.ft.com/content/4a477620-fb1c-403a-ad5e-0e16e75235ba,"Funding for European technology companies will plunge by nearly half this year, as US investors increasingly abandon the continent amid a global retreat by venture capital investors. The amount of money raised by tech start-ups in Europe is expected to reach about $45bn over 2023, according to an annual report compiled by London-based venture capital group Atomico. That is down from $82bn last year. Venture capital investment has fallen around the world since the pandemic, as rising interest rates hammer the valuations of public technology stocks and push investors to increasingly focus on generating profits. Atomico partner and head of intelligence Tom Wehmeier said investment in European tech companies remained 18 per cent higher than in 2020, while other regions were lower compared with pre-pandemic levels. “The European tech environment looks more stable now than at any point since the pandemic,” he said. “We see that bringing back certainty, a bit more predictability and helping restore confidence.” One reason for the shortfall this year was due to reduced funding from US investors. For deals involving relatively advanced European start-ups seeking “growth stage” funding, the share of capital from US investors has fallen from 39 per cent in 2021 to 25 per cent this year. So-called crossover investors, many of which are US funds, often participate in late-stage deals but this activity has ground to a near halt. Venture capital investment in the US continues to dwarf spending in Europe, with nearly triple the level of tech investment this year, according to the Atomico report. China and the rest of the world will each have equivalent levels to Europe. One bright spot has been the proliferation of massive fundraising deals for artificial intelligence companies. European start-ups such as France’s Mistral and Germany’s Aleph Alpha are raising among the largest financing rounds of the year, raising up to €400mn and $500mn respectively this year. Of the 36 European tech deals worth more than $100mn this year, 11 of them were AI companies. The US had 37 such AI deals over the same timeframe. “We see AI being the top theme in terms of number of investment rounds being raised at the early stages,” Wehmeier said. Large fundraising rounds have been few and far between in Europe this year, after the likes of financial technology start-ups Revolut and Klarna raised hundreds of millions of dollars in funding rounds during the pandemic boom. Some start-ups that have tapped investors this year needed to do so at substantially lower valuations. In September, Turkish grocery delivery start-up Getir raised $500mn at a $2.5bn valuation, a quarter of what it was worth just 18 months prior. While larger deals have declined, “early stage” or “seed” deals have remained relatively active as investors focus on smaller bets. Earlier-stage companies have also seen their valuations remain more resilient than more mature start-ups. While start-up valuations have settled back to long-term averages after rising during the pandemic, that correction hasn’t affected seed stage deals as deeply, according to Wehmeier.  “The degree of competitive intensity at seed has stayed strong,” he said.",tech

the_guardian,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/nov/28/techscape-binance-changpen-zhao,"Binance is guilty. The world’s largest crypto exchange admitted to a range of violations in a massive US court action, including unlicensed money transmitting, sanctions violations and anti-money laundering (AML) violations. Its founder, Changpeng Zhao, near-universally known as CZ, personally pled guilty to his failure to maintain money-laundering controls.
The failures “allowed money to flow to terrorists, cybercriminals, and child abusers through its platform”, the US secretary of the treasury, Janet Yellen, said. From our story:
	As part of a guilty plea, Zhao agreed to pay a $50m fine and would be barred from any involvement in the business. Binance too agreed to plead guilty, accept the appointment of a monitor and pay a criminal fine of nearly $1.81bn as well as a $2.51bn order of forfeiture to settle three criminal charges.
	Zhao wrote in a tweet: “Today, I stepped down as CEO of Binance. … I made mistakes, and I must take responsibility. This is best for our community, for Binance, and for myself … I can’t see myself being a CEO driving a startup again.”
	Big numbers regularly fly around the tech sector, particularly in crypto, so it’s worth saying the obvious: $4bn is a truly massive penalty. The criminal fine alone – $1.81bn – outweighs all the profit that the US government estimates Binance collected from Americans, ever. It dwarfs the €1.2bn charged to Meta over its breach of GDPR in May. It’s the third-largest fine handed to a tech company, anywhere, ever, just behind Google’s €5bn antitrust loss in the EU and Apple’s €13bn tax settlement in Ireland (the latter was overturned but is still in dispute).
	Which is why it is, at first glance, surprising to find crypto supporters celebrating the fine. But the question underpinning the settlement is whether it’s a full stop at the end of Binance’s spicy genesis, or simply the capital letter beginning the tale of its downfall. The cause for celebration in some quarters is simple enough: CZ pleaded guilty to a series of failings that, the US charges said, allowed Hamas to raise money, resulted in almost $1bn being transferred by people in Iran, Cuba and Syria, sent money to known darknet markets and ransomware wallets, and allowed more than a thousand transactions to known child abuse imagery marketplaces, and is not currently in jail.
	Binance still exists, and the fine was nowhere near enough to bankrupt the company. As part of the guilt plea, CZ’s personal fine was a mere $50m, leaving him a billionaire under any plausible assessment of his personal finances. If the enforcement action ends here, it is hard to conclude anything for the crypto industry other than: “Binance fought the law, and made generational wealth doing so.”
	But will the enforcement end there? The US government “is not seeking detention”, it said in a court filing, although it would rather CZ does not leave the country until his February sentencing anyway, due to his home being the UAE, which doesn’t have an extradition treaty with America.
	There is no legal requirement for the judge to follow the sentencing sought by the US government in its plea deal, and aspects of the deal explicitly allow for custodial time: some parts are only void if CZ gets more than 18 months in jail.
	The deal also carves out the option for the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to take its own action. The regulator declined to participate in the joint enforcement, which was a triple-header between the US agencies FinCEN, OFAC and CFTC, instead launching its own challenge in June. The SEC can’t send people to jail, but it can make life very difficult – and expensive – for anyone covered by its remit.
	And then there are the monitors. Binance will keep an “independent compliance monitor” for three years, it agreed with the government: an employee, paid by Binance but working for the US government, who is empowered to dig through anything and everything in the company looking for compliance breaches. An optimist might say the monitor will keep Binance on the straight and narrow as it regroups following the case. A pessimist might not.
	Trade secrets, oops edition
	How common is theft of trade secrets? It’s a tricky question to answer, because – for obvious reasons – it’s rarely done in the open, and when it is discovered, all parties usually have an incentive to keep things between themselves. Sometimes that fails because the sums of money involved are so astronomical that you can’t help but get the courts involved, and you get a big explosive trial like the one between Google’s Waymo and Uber last decade.
	Other times, that fails for somewhat dumber reasons, such as in the case of a former Valeo employee named Mohammad Moniruzzaman:

		On March 8, 2022, one of these video-conference meetings was scheduled. Mr Moniruzzaman, now employed by Nvidia, attended the video-conference call… and shared his computer screen during the call. When he minimized the PowerPoint presentation he had been sharing, however, he revealed one of Valeo’s verbatim source code files open on his computer. So brazen was Mr Moniruzzaman’s theft, the file path on his screen still read “ValeoDocs.” Valeo participants on the video-conference call immediately recognized the source code and took a screenshot before Mr Moniruzzaman was alerted of his error. By then it was too late to cover his tracks.
		The accidental revelation was sufficient to prompt German police to raid the self-driving car engineer’s home, where they “discovered Valeo documentation and hardware pinned on the walls of Mr Moniruzzaman’s home office”, per the lawsuit, reported by the Verge. I’m not sure whether or not to write it off as a coincidence that both Waymo v Uber and Valeo v Nvidia involve self-driving car companies. Is it an industry that is more heavily reliant on trade secrets than most? Or is it just one where people are discovered more often?
		The coup that keeps on giving

		I’m wary of even mentioning Sam Altman in this newsletter. He was fired in a boardroom coup, hired by Microsoft, triggered a near unanimous resignation threat amongst his former staff, and hired back in the space between last week’s newsletter and the one before. Even writing his name seems to guarantee I’ll be sending edits to this one right up until we send it out on Tuesday, at which point it will promptly be rendered out of date before you even read it.
		And so, quickly: Dan Milmo’s rundown of what exactly happened last week is worth a read if events sped past you too fast to be perceived. What conclusions should we draw? I think the most important one is that we already have an inhuman system that is more powerful than any individual human and fundamentally incapable of being prevented from carrying out its own goals, and it’s called capitalism. OpenAI tried to build an organisation that could be restrained from chasing pure profit. It didn’t work.

forbes,https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbestechcouncil/2023/11/28/the-role-of-technology-in-tackling-last-mile-delivery-complexity/?sh=4f535cfd26fe,"During the annual shopping and shipping climax last December, 28% of U.K. online consumers said delayed and lost packages had made them lose trust in last-mile delivery.
Everyone seems to have a story about air travel, but more and more people seem to have at least one about parcel delivery, too. It seems that summer involves the question, “Will my flight leave as scheduled?” In winter, peak anxiety is focused on, “Will my package arrive in time for the holidays?”
PROMOTED

Surveys aside, customers’ stories about things going wrong in both these complex systems have a huge impact on public perception. In the U.S., for example, stories about air travel chaos have become summer staples. Airlines operating typically only cancel 1% to 2% of their 25,000 scheduled flightsa day. But that’s still up to 500 flights a day—and easily 50,000 unfortunate stories to be shared.
With nearly 60 million parcels shipped daily in the U.S., a similar success would still leave a million customers disappointed—every single day.

Coping With Growing Complexity
I would like to break a lance for the quality of both industries. They are not only good at dealing with complexity, but they know how to handle growing complexity as the volume of people and packages to be shipped increases steadily—with notable exceptions during the Covid-19 pandemic years.
Airlines have invested heavily in technology to streamline operations—online check-in, baggage-tag printers and automated bag drop, for example, are saving passengers from an awful lot of traditional standing in line.
In the same way, last-mile delivery companies have harnessed technology to get more and more packages delivered on time. A little over a decade ago, a group of French researchers estimated that between 10% and 40% of parcels could not be delivered as planned. But by late 2022, first-attempt delivery rates in Western economies were reliably between 88% in Austria and 99.7% in the Netherlands, according to Parcel Monitor and TI Insight. (For the record, the U.S.’s 97.8% outdid both the U.K.’s 94.3% and Germany’s 94.8%.)
Technology has driven this improvement. It can now assist delivery drivers with automated address correction, accurate geocoding and AI-powered route-optimization—and recipients with scheduled delivery time frames as well as live package tracking with dynamic ETA predictions, allowing them to re-route their package, even at the last minute. First-attempt delivery success has hence improved even as parcel volumes have exploded.
E-commerce has been crucial in driving the idea of “seamless delivery” to cut customers’ wait and hassle between making a purchase online and getting their order delivered at home. Technology-enhanced delivery options abound: One-day or two-hour, in- or near-store kiosk pickup, and parcel lockers have all become standard options. Retailers set themselves the goal of offering their customers consistently high-quality service from virtual shopping carts to real-world doorstep—and last-mile delivery companies have risen to that challenge.
Helping Customers Feel In Control
My optimism about last-mile delivery is bolstered by the fact that e-commerce brands and their customers are pushing the industry for better communication, just as they pushed for faster delivery. More and more shipping companies are proactively sending delivery updates on the real-time status of a shipment, giving recipients transparency and the ability to manage the delivery according to their schedule.
The next step is to develop such features into full two-way omnichannel communication without unduly encumbering delivery drivers. Recipients should have the ability to send drop-off instructions, even last minute, because their plans have changed. They should have avenues to provide feedback on the overall delivery experience.
The interaction of AI-powered tools—software or robots—with drivers and consumers will play an ever more central role in last-mile delivery. One day we will also see full-scale drone delivery and self-driving delivery trucks.
But the hurdles to commercialization are currently so great that evolution will come before another revolution. Before we get the robot-delivered package, (human) drivers will see their routing and specific delivery instructions become more granular and reliable.
And consumers will find they can almost set their watch by the time their package gets delivered—that’s how accurate delivery windows will become. The ideal is to eliminate the WISMO (where is my order?) query—and reduce the noise in the customer service department.
Imagine if airlines could do that too, answering every customer query even before it pops into their heads.",tech
cnn,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/11/28/tech/federal-judge-ftc-meta-personal-data/index.html,"A federal judge will not block the US government from expanding a landmark $5 billion privacy settlement with Instagram-parent Meta, paving the way for the Federal Trade Commission to propose tough new rules on how the social media giant can monetize user data.
The decision Monday by District Judge Timothy Kelly allows the FTC to move ahead with a proposal banning Meta from profiting off data it collects from users under the age of 18.
If approved, the limitation could significantly restrict Meta’s data-driven business, particularly as it seeks to court younger users and to grow in new product areas, such as virtual reality.
The background
The FTC has also suggested tougher rules governing Meta’s use of facial recognition technology and forcing Meta to halt the rollout of any new products or services until third-party audits can demonstrate that Meta is complying with the settlement’s privacy obligations.
The package of potential restrictions would represent some of the most significant impositions on Meta’s business since the 2020 privacy order that resolved a federal probe into the company’s Cambridge Analytica privacy fiasco. (In 2018, Meta admitted to the inadvertent exposure of up to 87 million users’ information to the political analysis firm.)
And it would draw a sharp contrast to Congress, where US lawmakers have spent years fruitlessly debating legislation in response to allegations that Meta has harmed the mental health and privacy of teens.
Multiple whistleblowers have come forward alleging that Meta knew its apps could be harmful to users’ well-being, and multiple states have filed lawsuitsagainst the company accusing it of failing to do enough to protect users. Meta has said that it invests heavily in user well-being and that it has developed 30 tools for parents and teens to manage their experiences with the company’s products.
A Meta response
In a statement, a Meta spokesperson said Kelly’s decision “does not address the substance of the FTC’s allegations, which are without merit. By the end of this year, we will have invested $5 billion since 2019 in a rigorous privacy program that has embedded privacy into our products from the start.”
“We are considering our legal options in light of the Court’s ruling and will continue to vigorously fight the FTC’s unlawful attempt to unilaterally rewrite our agreement,” the spokesperson added.
Meta had previously called the FTC proposal “a political stunt” that singles out Meta “while allowing Chinese companies like TikTok to operate without constraint on American soil.”
The FTC declined to comment on the ruling. Last week, the agency issued an order giving Meta a deadline of Dec. 11 to respond to the FTC’s proposal to expand the settlement.
Next steps
In Monday’s opinion, Kelly wrote that the FTC retains the authority to reopen and amend the order affecting Meta without the need for prior court approval.
Meta had argued that the US District Court for the District of Columbia should be the one to decide whether the FTC could reopen the matter.
Meta could potentially seek to appeal Monday’s ruling to the US Court of Appeals for the DC Circuit, but the decision “appears carefully crafted and likely to be sustained,” according to Paul Gallant, an industry analyst at the market research firm TD Cowen. It’s unclear when the FTC may finalize its proposed rules, Gallant added, but it could occur in the spring of 2024.
Meta could still attempt to challenge any eventual FTC rule changes in federal court.",tech

Hong KongCNN — 
The chairman and CEO of Chinese video game live-streaming platform DouYu has been arrested, becoming the latest business leader to run afoul of authorities in the world’s second largest economy.
DouYu (DOYU) said in a regulatory filing Tuesday that its chief, Chen Shaojie, had been arrested by police in the southwestern city of Chengdu on or around November 16. The company said it had only been informed of the arrest on Monday.
It “has not received any official notice of the investigation against Mr. Chen or the reasons for Mr. Chen’s apparent arrest,” it added, warning that his “ongoing detention and any subsequent related legal proceedings and enforcement actions” could have a material impact on its business.
In a statement posted on Chinese social media on Wednesday, police in Chengdu said a 39-year-old man surnamed Chen was arrested on suspicion of opening a casino. State-run news agency Xinhua cited the statement as confirmation that the DouYu executive had been arrested.
The news came two weeks after the Cover News, a state-owned media outlet , reported that Chen had become unreachable. It cited unconfirmed reports that Chen was being investigated and had been missing for nearly three weeks.

Yet another CEO goes AWOL in China
Chen’s disappearance came about five months after the Cyberspace Administration of China launched an onsite inspection of DouYu to investigate what it called “serious” problems related to the platform, including alleged pornography and “vulgar” content, according to a May statement from the internet watchdog.
Douyu, which means “fighting fish” in Chinese, has also come under scrutiny for allegedly hosting online gambling, which is illegal in mainland China.
Last December, three people running a popular account on the platform were each sentenced to up to six years in prison after being found guilty of “opening casinos” by the Intermediate People’s Court in Chengdu, according to state media.
They had run an online lottery that invited users to place bets, which attracted about 4.4 million users, and collected almost 120 million yuan ($16.9 million), the court said in a statement.
The court described it as the first gambling case involving a live-streaming platform that police had handled under the direct orders of the Ministry of Public Security, suggesting it was of national significance and should serve as “a warning to society.”
In its latest filing, DouYu said it was committed to complying with regulations. The company is currently operating as normal, while working on contingency plans in response to Chen’s arrest, it added.
DouYu, which said in its filing that it could not comment on any pending legal proceedings, did not immediately respond to a request for comment from CNN.
Sweeping crackdown
Chen is one of the latest high-flying executives in China to come under scrutiny by authorities. This year, more than a dozen leaders from industries including technology, finance and real estate have gone missing, faced detention or been subjected to corruption probes.
International consulting firms have also faced rising risks, such as the possibility of raids or detentions of executives.
The developments have had a chilling effect on China’s business community, with some entrepreneurs said to be lying low in response to the uncertainty.
Chen founded DouYu and quickly built it into one of China’s most valuable startups.
Often compared to Amazon’s Twitch service, the Tencent-backed company hosts interactive live-streams of video games while letting users chat in real time and inviting them to watch other content created for its platform.
DouYu’s shares closed nearly 6% in New York on Tuesday following news of the arrest.",tech
cnn,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/11/20/tech/microsoft-ceo-satya-nadella-openai-sam-altman/index.html,"CNN
 — 
Microsoft’s CEO Satya Nadella hinted on Monday that he was still open to Sam Altman rejoining OpenAI – despite an announcement earlier in the day that Altman would join Microsoft’s artificial intelligence innovation division.

Nadella said he was “open to both options” when asked in a Monday CNBC interview whether Altman would actually join Microsoft.

“Look, that is for the OpenAI board and management and the employees to choose,” Nadella said. “We chose to explicitly partner with OpenAI and we want to continue to do so, and obviously, that depends on the people of OpenAI staying there or coming to Microsoft.”


ChatGPT creator OpenAI was thrown into turmoil on Friday when the board abruptly fired Altman. With a $13 billion investment in OpenAI, Microsoft is one of the company’s biggest backers.

The firing set off a weekend of chaos: OpenAI’s president, Greg Brockman, resigned, and hundreds of OpenAI employees threatened to quit over Altman’s firing. The company appointed an interim CEO, Mira Murati, as well.

On Monday, OpenAI announced a new interim CEO, Twitch co-founder Emmett Shear – and Microsoft said it would hire Altman. Microsoft’s stock closed at an all-time high after the announcement.

Yet in a fluid leadership situation at OpenAI, reports soon emerged that Altman was mulling a return to the company.

Nadella reiterated Microsoft’s commitment to OpenAI and to Altman “irrespective of what configuration.”

“We obviously want Sam and Greg to have a fantastic home if they’re not going to be at OpenAI,” he said.

When asked about Microsoft’s view of OpenAI and possibility of obtaining a board seat, Nadella said, “It’s clear something has to change around the governance.”



In a separate interview on Kara Swisher’s “On” podcast Monday, Nadella demurred when asked whether Altman may one day be considered for the CEO role at Microsoft if he joins the company.

“Let’s just say it’s fantastic to have lots of capable people who can become CEOs of Microsoft,” Nadella said.",tech
cnn,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/04/23/tech/iphone-thief-recovery-key/index.html,"CNN — 
A complex but concerning method of gaining control over a user’s iPhone and permanently locking them out the device appears to be on the rise.
Some iPhone thieves are exploiting a security setting, called the recovery key, that makes it nearly impossible for owners to access their photos, messages, data and more, according to a recent Wall Street Journal report. Some victims also told the publication their bank accounts were drained after the thieves gained access to their financial apps.
It’s important to note, however, this type of takeover is hard to pull off. It requires a criminal essentially watching an iPhone user enter the device’s passcode – for example, by looking over their shoulder at a bar or sporting event – or manipulating the device’s owner so they’ll share their passcode. And that’s all before they physically steal the device. 
From there, a thief could use the passcode to change the device’s Apple ID, turn off “Find my iPhone” so their location can’t be tracked, and then reset the recovery key, a complex 28-digit code intended to protect its owners from online hackers. 
Apple requires this key to help reset or regain access to an Apple ID in an effort to bolster the user’s security, but if a thief changes it, the original owner will not have the new code and will be locked out of the account. 
“We sympathize with people who have had this experience and we take all attacks on our users very seriously, no matter how rare,” an Apple spokesperson said in a statement to CNN. “We work tirelessly every day to protect our users’ accounts and data, and are always investigating additional protections against emerging threats like this one.”
On its website, Apple warns “you’re responsible for maintaining access to your trusted devices and your recovery key. If you lose both of these items, you could be locked out of your account permanently.”
Jeff Pollard, VP and principal analyst at Forrester Research, said the company should offer more customer support options and “ways for Apple users to authenticate so they can reset these settings.”
For now, however, there are a handful of steps users can take to potentially protect themselves from having this happen to them. 
Protect the passcode
The first step is protecting the passcode. 
An Apple spokesperson told CNN people can use Face ID or Touch ID when unlocking their phone in public to avoid revealing their passcode to anyone who might be watching. 
Users can also set up a longer, alphanumeric passcode that’s harder for bad actors to figure out. Device owners should also change the passcode immediately if they believe someone else has seen it.
Screen Time settings
Another step someone could consider is a hack not necessarily endorsed by Apple but one that’s been circulating online. Within an iPhone’s Screen Time setting, which allows guardians to set up restrictions on how kids can use the device, there is the option to set up a secondary password that would be required from any user before they could successfully change an Apple ID. 
By enabling this, a thief would be prompted for that secondary password before changing an Apple ID password.
Back up phone regularly
Finally, users can protect themselves by regularly backing up an iPhone – via iCloud or iTunes – so data can be recovered in the case an iPhone is stolen. At the same time, users may want to consider storing important photos or other sensitive files and data in another cloud service, such as Google Photos, Microsoft OneDrive, Amazon Photos or Dropbox. 
This won’t stop a bad actor from gaining access to the device, but it should limit some of the fallout if it ever should happen.",tech
cnn,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/04/12/business/electric-car-regulations-response/index.html,"CNN — 
The US government is planning to change auto emissions standards in a way that means automakers would need to sell a lot more electric vehicles. By 2032, electric vehicles would need to make up about two-thirds of all the new cars sold in America.
Without these requirements, electric vehicles would have reached that sort of market share sometime after 2035, according to Moody’s industry analyst Matthias Heck. The goals laid out by the EPA are manageable, he said, but it won’t be easy and high levels of investment would be needed. For now, the proposal is still just that, a proposal, and could well change before before being finalized, Heck pointed out.
Over the next decade things will change a lot, including charging infrastructure and the vehicles themselves. Consumers will be drawn to electric vehicles more as battery technology improves and prices drop. And government incentives, like those under the new Inflation Reduction Act, will help, too.

It’s important to remember that, nearly a decade from now, electric vehicles are going to be different from what’s on the market today, said Chris Harto a policy analyst for transportation and energy at Consumer Reports. And even as EV market share rises to two-thirds, it’s not like EVs will flood America’s roads overnight, he said. Eighty percent of the cars on the roads in 2032 will still be gas-powered, he said, but shopping for a new vehicle will be different.
‘We’re talking about past cost parity, so it’s going to be the same price or cheaper,” compared to a gas-powered car, he said.
At the same time, driving ranges will increase, fast charging will be easier and more accessible and owners will enjoy greatly reduced operating costs, Harto said. Moody’s Heck predicted that next-generation EV batteries expected in the next few years will go 30% further on a charge and will recharge 30% faster.

Future electric vehicles like the Chevrolet Blazer EV will provide more options for mainstream consumers.
General Motors
So when combined with improved charging networks – something else that can be expected over that time – electric cars won’t be a particularly hard sell for consumers who are just looking for the best vehicle at a good price, Harto said.
There will also be more electric vehicle models available by 2032. Today, there are “EV equivalents” available for roughly 40% of the gas vehicle models Americans can buy, according to Elizabeth Krear, vice president of the electric vehicle practice at JD Power. Electric market share now stands at 8.5%.
Krear did not specifically comment on the chances of EVs making up two-thirds of the US auto market by 2032. But by 2026, just three years from now, Krear expects there will be “EV equivalents” for 75% of the vehicles Americans shop for and market share will have already tripled to 27%. In California, where EVs are more popular and there are more models available, EV market share is already expected to reach the two-thirds mark before 2032.

EU was set to ban internal combustion engine cars. Then Germany suddenly changed its mind
California plans to allow the sale of only fully electric and plug-in hybrid vehicles by 2035, a goal it’s on the way to meeting, according to Corey Cantor, an analyst with Bloomberg NEF. So California should be at over 80% market share for plug-in vehicles, including plug-in hybrids, by 2032 and California itself, through its sheer size, is a big factor in the overall US vehicle market.
“California’s influence on the whole country Is really bringing it forward to maybe a year sooner than where it would be without California,” he said.
Reaching two-thirds EV market share mark by 2032 isn’t a sure thing, said Cantor, but it should be manageable.
The increasing number of automakers entering the EV market will also help, said Ivan Drury, an industry analyst with Edmunds.com. Many car buyers tend to be very loyal to their preferred vehicle brand.
“Not everyone is willing to jump ship just because it’s an EV or it has X-Y-Z piece of technology,” said Drury. ” I think that when you have something like Toyota, definitely a loyal consumer base, they don’t want anything other than Toyotas.”
Currently, Toyota offers only one electric model in the United States, the BZ4X SUV, but more are planned. Honda, another Japanese brand with a loyal following, offers no EVs currently but the company is gearing up factories in Ohioto build future EV models. Honda expects to offer its first EV next year. General Motors also has a number of EV models coming in the next year or two.

Electric cars don't need better batteries. America needs better charging networks
GM, on its own, will provide a good test of the American market’s readiness for EVs in the next couple of years, said Drury. That automaker, which has pledged to offer nothing but electric passenger vehicles by 2035, will begin selling models in a range of market segments and price points.
The Alliance for Automotive Innovation, an industry group that includes most major automakers operating in the country, posted a statement on its website expressing caution about the goals and asking for cooperation from various government agencies.
“[A] lot has to go right for this massive – and unprecedented – change in our automotive market and industrial base to succeed,” the group wrote in its statement.
At some point, various automakers that may have been slower than GM to embrace electric will simply have to make the switch for economic reasons, said Cantor. Once consumers start broadly embracing EVs, continuing to invest in the development and production of internal combustion vehicles just won’t make economic sense any longer.",tech
cnn,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/04/12/tech/fbi-public-charging-port-warning/index.html,"New YorkCNN — 
The FBI is warning consumers against using public phone charging stations in order to avoid exposing their devices to malicious software. 
Public USB stations like the kind found at malls and airports are being used by bad actors to spread malware and monitoring software, according to a tweet last week from the FBI’s Denver branch. The agency did not provide any specific examples. 
“Carry your own charger and USB cord and use an electrical outlet instead,” the agency advised in the tweet.
While public charging stations are attractive to many when devices are running critically low on battery, security experts have for years raised concerns about the risk. In 2011, researchers coined the term “juice jacking” to describe the problem.
“Just by plugging your phone into a [compromised] power strip or charger, your device is now infected, and that compromises all your data,” Drew Paik, formerly of security firm Authentic8, explained to CNN in 2017.
The cord you use to charge your phone is also used to send data from your phone to other devices. For instance, when you plug your iPhone into your Mac with the charging cord, you can download photos from your phone to your computer. 
If a port is compromised, there’s no limit to what information a hacker could take, Paik previously explained to CNN. That includes your email, text messages, photos and contacts. 
“The FBI regularly provides reminders and public service announcements in conjunction with our partners,” Vikki Migoya, public affairs officer at the FBI’s Denver branch, told CNN. “This was a general reminder for the American public to stay safe and diligent, especially while traveling.”
The Federal Communications Commission also updated a blog post on Tuesday warning that a corrupted charging port can allow a malicious actor to lock a device or extract personal data and passwords. 
“In some cases, criminals may have intentionally left cables plugged in at charging stations,” according to the FCC blog post. “There have even been reports of infected cables being given away as promotional gifts.”",tech

Amazon on Tuesday announced a new chatbot called Q for people to use at work.
The product, announced at Amazon Web Services’ Reinvent conference in Las Vegas, represents Amazon’s latest effort to challenge Microsoft and Google in productivity software.

Initially, Q can help people understand the capabilities of AWS. People will be able to talk with it in communication apps such as Salesforce’s Slack and software developers’ text-editing applications, Adam Selipsky, CEO of AWS, said onstage at Reinvent.

The tool can automatically make changes to source code so developers have less work to do, Selipsky said. The service will be able to connect to more than 40 enterprise systems, he said. That includes Microsoft 365, Dropbox, Salesforce and Zendesk. People will also be able to upload and ask questions about documents while interacting with Q.
“AWS Q will be a game changer for AWS customers who have a plethora of service options, oftentimes overlapping to navigate,” wrote Steven Dickens, vice president and practice leader at the Futurum Group, a technology research firm. “AWS has resisted the urge to make an AI assistant for each service in its portfolio and, as a result, I expect to see Q become widely adopted in the months ahead by both developers and cloud admins alike.”",tech

Amazon’s AWS cloud unit announced its new Trainium2 artificial intelligence chip and the general-purpose Graviton4 processor during its Reinvent conference in Las Vegas on Tuesday. The company also said it will offer access to Nvidia’slatest H200 AI graphics processing units.
Amazon Web Services is trying to stand out as a cloud provider with a variety of cost-effective options. It won’t just sell cheap Amazon-branded products, though. Just as in its online retail marketplace, Amazon’s cloud will feature top-of-the-line products. Specifically, that means highly sought after GPUs from top AI chipmaker Nvidia.

The dual-pronged approach might put AWS in a better position to go up against its top competitor. Earlier this month Microsoft took a similar dual-pronged approach by revealing its inaugural AI chip, the Maia 100, and also saying the Azure cloud will have Nvidia H200 GPUs.
ADVERTISING
The Graviton4 processors are based on Arm architecture and consume less energy than chips from Intel or AMD. Graviton4 promises 30% better performance than the existing Graviton3 chips, enabling what AWS said is better output for the price. Inflation has been higher than usual, inspiring central bankers to hike interest rates. Organizations that want to keep using AWS but lower their cloud bills to better deal with the economy might wish to consider moving to Graviton.
More than 50,000 AWS customers are already using Graviton chips. Startup Databricks and Amazon-backed Anthropic, an OpenAI competitor, plan to build models with the new Trainium2 chips, which will boast four times better performance than the original model, Amazon said.
AWS said it will operate more than 16,000 Nvidia GH200 Grace Hopper Superchips, which contain H100 GPUs and Nvidia’s Arm-based general-purpose processors, for Nvidia’s research and development group. Other AWS customers won’t be able to use these chips.
Demand for Nvidia GPUs has skyrocketed since startup OpenAI released its ChatGPT chatbot last year, wowing people with its abilities to summarize information and compose human-like text. It led to a shortage of Nvidia’s chips as companies raced to incorporate similar generative AI technologies into their products.

Normally, the introduction of an AI chip from a cloud provider might present a challenge to Nvidia, but in this case, Amazon is simultaneously expanding its collaboration with Nvidia. At the same time, AWS customers will have another option to consider for AI computing if they aren’t able to secure the latest Nvidia GPUs.
Amazon is the leader in cloud computing but has been renting out GPUs in its cloud for over a decade. In 2018 it followed cloud challengers Alibaba and Google in releasing an AI processor that it developed in-house, giving customers powerful computing at an affordable price.
AWS has launched more than 200 cloud products since 2006, when it released its EC2 and S3 services for computing and storing data. Not all of them have been hits. Some go without updates for a long time and a rare few are discontinued, freeing up Amazon to reallocate resources. However, the company continues to invest in the Graviton and Trainium programs, suggesting that Amazon senses demand.
AWS didn’t announce release dates for virtual-machine instances with Nvidia H200 chips, or instances relying on its Trainium2 silicon. Customers can start testing Graviton4 virtual-machine instances now before they become commercially available in the next few months.",tech
cnbc,https://www.cnbc.com/2023/11/28/uk-regulators-say-adobes-figma-acquisition-could-harm-competition.html,"Britain’s top competition watchdog said Tuesday that Adobe’s proposed $20 billion acquisition of Figma could harm the U.K.’s digital design sector, findings that could mean a major setback for the merger.
The Competition and Markets Authority said the deal could “eliminate competition,” “reduce innovation” and “remove Figma as a threat to Adobe’s flagship Photoshop and Illustrator products,” according to a release. The findings are provisional, but the regulator said it will investigate potential remedies, “which could include blocking the deal outright.”

Adobe announced plans to buy Figma, which allows users to collaborate on app and website design, for $20 billion in September last year. In addition to regulatory probes in the U.K., the deal has been under scrutiny from the U.S. Department of Justice and the European Union.

“Our provisional conclusion is therefore that the Merger would remove competition between close competitors and an important competitive constraint on Figma, in a market in which Figma is already the strongest player by far and there are few other competitive constraints,” the CMA wrote in the release.
A representative for Figma told CNBC the company is “disappointed” by the CMA’s findings and that they “strongly disagree” with the idea that Figma competes with Adobe or will do so in the future.
“The facts are Figma operates in a dynamic and highly-competitive market for product design and development, and Figma has not spent a single dollar or hired a single engineer to build creative tools,” the spokesperson said. “We remain committed to the deal, confident in the facts, and convinced our proposed combination with Adobe is a win for consumers and should be approved.”
Adobe said it is “disappointed” and disagrees with the CMA’s perspective.

“Adobe and Figma will deliver significant value to customers,” Adobe told CNBC in a statement. “We are reviewing the provisional findings and will reengage with the CMA on the facts and merits of the case.” 
David Wadhwani, a key Adobe executive behind the Figma deal, expressed frustration in October over the slow pace of regulatory approval. The company has previously said it expects to close the deal this year, and Adobe has agreed to pay Figma $1 billion if either the merger is not completed by March 2024 or it is rejected by regulators.
The CMA requested responses from Adobe and Figma by Dec. 19. The regulator said a final decision will be issued by Feb. 25 next year.",tech
cnbc,https://www.cnbc.com/2023/11/28/amazon-touts-record-sales-in-kickoff-to-holiday-shopping-season.html,"Amazon said Tuesday it rang up “record-breaking” sales in the run-up to Cyber Monday as consumers, still pinched by inflation, sought discounts.
The company said the period from Nov. 17 to Cyber Monday marked its “biggest ever” holiday shopping event compared to the same 11-day stretch last year. Amazon, which did not disclose actual sales figures, added that shoppers worldwide bought more than 1 billion items during the period.

In recent years, as more shopping has moved online, retailers have started running promotions well in advance of Black Friday, looking to hook early holiday shoppers. Big sale days like Black Friday and Cyber Monday no longer have the same significance as they used to, and consumers often spread their holiday shopping over a period of several weeks, rather than just a single day, or Thanksgiving weekend.
“We kicked off the holiday season with Prime Big Deal Days in October, and extended our Black Friday and Cyber Monday holiday shopping event to 11 days to accommodate even more deals over more days to make shopping more convenient for customers — helping them save nearly 70% more than the same period last year,” said Doug Herrington, CEO of Worldwide Amazon Stores, in a statement.
Amazon said shoppers gravitated to products like COSRX Snail Mucin skincare, Fire TV sticks, Ring doorbells, and Bissell vacuum cleaners during Black Friday and Cyber Monday.
U.S. shoppers spent a record $12.4 billion on Cyber Monday, up 9.6% from last year, and trouncing initial expectations for sales of $12 billion, according to data from Adobe Analytics released on Tuesday. Online sales during Cyber Week, or the five days between Thanksgiving and Cyber Monday, reached $38 billion, surpassing Adobe’s projected $37.2 billion.
Retailers and analysts were cautious heading into this year’s holiday shopping season. While consumers have remained resilient, grocery prices remain high, and the resumption of student loan payments has eaten into some shoppers’ holiday budgets.",tech

Twilio shares were up nearly 4.5% in Tuesday trading.

Anson did not hold any Twilio stock for the period ended Sept. 30, according to securities filings, but has since built a stake valued at around $50 million, the person familiar said, who spoke anonymously to discuss private communications freely. The letter to the board urges Twilio to either sell itself or at a minimum, divest its data and applications business, the person familiar said.

The growth of the stake coincided with Anson’s hiring of Sagar Gupta from Legion Partners. Gupta led Legion’s activist engagements with Twilio and Nutanix, a cloud computing firm.
The news was first reported by The Information.
“Twilio regularly engages with shareholders and appreciates constructive input that furthers our goal of creating sustainable long-term value,” a Twilio spokesperson told CNBC in a statement.
The continued activist attention caps off a challenging year for Twilio, which makes software that helps businesses engage with their customers. The company’s stock is up around 28% year to date but remains well off its 2021 highs. In February, the company cut around 1,500 employees, or 17% of its workforce citing a need for heightened efficiency. Those layoffs followed a similar headcount reduction in September 2022.

The company also implemented a reorganization in February, creating two new business units: Data & Applications and Communications. A Twilio spokesperson told CNBC that the February reorganization “reflected input” from Twilio’s shareholders. Nonetheless, Anson has urged the board to divest the former business unit if it can’t secure a full sale to a strategic buyer.

Google said it was investigating the issue which is affecting some users of its hugely popular cloud storage service.
The problem was first reported on 22 November by a user who said their Drive had reset to a May 2023 version. 
It is not known how many customers are affected, but people in multiple countries have reported problems.
Drive is part of Google Workspace, a suite of applications which has more than three billion users worldwide.
Users reacted angrily on Google's support site, with one calling it ""very devastating"", adding ""the files are very important to me"".
Others said they had lost files from recent months - and wrote of the stress it was causing them.
""This is crazy and not a dependable cloud service,"" one commented. ""In a panic!"" they added.
Another posted: ""I pay for this service every month and will pursue legal action if needed. Unacceptable and highly aggravating.""
More updates
The original poster, who was using Drive for Desktop on Windows, says none of the fixes suggested by Google so far have worked. 
In their post on the forum, Google said they were investigating the reports and would ""follow up with more updates"". 
They suggest that people do not disconnect their account in the Drive for desktop app, and do not delete or move the app data folder.
They also recommend making a copy of the folder, if users are able to.
Enza Ianopollo, a data privacy expert at analyst firm Forrester, said the situation was a ""big deal"" for Google.
She said it was ""very, very necessary"" for the tech giant to give users a full explanation of what had happened.
""Not just in terms of 'wait, your data will appear back,' but really understanding what happened to the data"", she told the BBC.

bbc,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-67521226,"Children are making indecent images of other children using artificial intelligence (AI) image generators, according to a UK charity.
The UK Safer Internet Centre (UKSIC) said it had received ""a small number of reports"" from schools but called for action now before the problem grew.
It said children might need help to understand that what they were making was considered child abuse material.
The charity wants teachers and parents to work together.
It pointed out that, while young people might be motivated by curiosity rather than intent to cause harm, it was illegal in all circumstances under UK law to make, possess, or distribute such images, whether they are real or generated by AI.
It said children might lose control of the material and end up circulating it online, without realising there are consequences for these actions. It also warned that these images could potentially be used for blackmail.
Knowledge gap
New research conducted by classroom tech firm RM Technology, with 1,000 pupils, suggests that just under a third are using AI ""to look at inappropriate things online"". 
""Students using AI regularly is now commonplace,"" said Tasha Gibson, online safety manager at the firm.
""In fact, their understanding of AI is more advanced than most teachers - creating a knowledge gap. This makes keeping pupils safe online and preventing misuse increasingly difficult. 
""With AI set to grow in popularity, closing this knowledge gap must become a top priority.""
It also found teachers were divided over whether it should be the responsibility of parents, schools or governments to teach children about the harms caused by such material.
The UKSIC wants a collaborative approach, with schools working together with parents.
""[We] need to see steps being taken now, before schools become overwhelmed and the problem grows,"" said UKSIC director David Wright.
""Young people are not always aware of the seriousness of what they are doing, yet these types of harmful behaviours should be anticipated when new technologies, like AI generators, become more accessible to the public.
""An increase in criminal content being made in schools is something we never want to see, and interventions must be made urgently to prevent this from spreading further.""
Victoria Green, CEO of the Marie Collins Foundation - a charity which helps children impacted by sexual abuse - warned of the ""lifelong"" damage that could be caused. 
""The imagery may not have been created by children to cause harm but, once shared, this material could get into the wrong hands and end up on dedicated abuse sites. 
""There is a real risk that the images could be further used by sex offenders to shame and silence victims.""
'Declothing' app dangers
The scope for AI to turn children into the generators of extreme content was demonstrated in September by an app which creates the impression of having removed someone's clothing in a photo.
It was used to create fake nude images of young girls in Spain, with more than 20 girls, aged between 11 and 17, coming forward as victims.
The images had been circulating on social media without their knowledge. So far there have been no charges brought against the boys who made the pictures.
So-called ""declothing"" apps began emerging on social media sites in 2019, often on messaging service Telegram as automated software with AI features - also known as bots.
Initially very unsophisticated, improvements to generative AI have allowed apps - like that used in Spain - to become much more effective in creating photorealistic fake nude images.
The Spanish bot has nearly 50,000 subscribers - implying it has had that many users, who pay a fee to create pictures, typically after being able to make several for free.
The BBC asked the maker of the bot for comment but they refused to provide a response.
Javaad Malik, a cyber expert at IT security firm KnowBe4, told the BBC it was becoming harder to differentiate between real and AI-generated images, a trend that was fuelling the use of ""declothing"" apps.
""It's got mass appeal unfortunately, so the trend is just going up and we're seeing a lot of revenge porn-type activities where cultural or religious beliefs cause a lot more issues for victims,"" he said.",tech

One customer told the BBC the outage left him unable to pay his rent.
HSBC apologised for ""the inconvenience"". 
""It is impacting HSBC UK customers only - there is no impact to First Direct or M&S Bank customers,"" it said, referring to other divisions of HSBC UK.
The problems started shortly after 08:00 GMT on Friday, with the bank saying they were ""investigating this as a matter of urgency"".
Around 09:00 GMT on Saturday, HSBC posted on X saying the glitch had been resolved and online and mobile banking services were back up and running but that ""some services maybe slower as customers log in"". 
'I had to find out online'
Marius Acsinte, 34, told the BBC his HSBC account was unavailable, causing him several problems.
""I'm not able to open the app to pay my rent due today,"" he said.
""I was expecting the bank would send a message or an email explaining why, but instead I had to find out online. 
""It doesn't matter if it's Black Friday tonight or not, I'm not able to use my money and nobody informed me about why that's happening.""
Judi Sutherland, 76, said the problem particularly hits her as someone who lives in a rural area.
""I live in the Highlands of Scotland where branches have been systematically and carelessly closed throughout the region,"" she said. 
""This loss of service means that some would have to make a journey to Aberdeen to access their accounts - a round trip of some 450 miles. 
""The online service from HSBC has been excellent in the past but this outage does underline the vulnerability and dependency of rural communities on such services,"" she said.
Others have shared their frustration at being unable to make card payments online, because they cannot verify purchases using the app.
But the firm said customers affected in this way could ""opt for a one time passcode via SMS"".

The exact number of people affected by the problems at the bank is unclear, because users must have a reason to check their online banking app to know if it is working.
HSBC has around 14.8 million customers across the UK. It is unknown how many of these customers use mobile and online banking, the firm estimates that nine out of 10 transactions at the bank are made digitally.
The bank previously announced it would close 114 branches in the UK in 2023. At the time, it said this was due to an increase in customers using online banking.
'Sort it out'
Social media users on X responded to HSBC UK's post on the platform with complaints - some saying they were unable to verify payments for Black Friday purchases or settle bills on payday.
""I got paid today and cannot pay any bills! Sort it out HSBC,"" complained one user. 
Others signalled their frustration at being unable to move money between accounts so they could make online purchases.
Despite the problems starting early on Friday morning, the bank did not update its service status page, which provides information about the availability of digital services like online, mobile and phone banking, until around 11:00 GMT - something which also annoyed customers.
""It's the lack of communication from the start of the issue that's most worrying. You haven't even updated your own service website. I'll definitely be moving some of my funds due to the poor communication,"" wrote one person.
Sam Richardson, deputy editor of Which? Money, said the outage would cause ""a real headache"" for customers.
""We strongly advise customers that have been left out of pocket to keep evidence of extra expenses they may have incurred as a result of the outage, so they can be claimed back from HSBC,"" he said.

bbc,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-67358369,"Social media platforms should fight online grooming by not suggesting children as ""friends"" by default, the communications watchdog says. 
The warning is contained in Ofcom's first guidance for tech platforms on complying with the Online Safety Act.
This covers how they should tackle illegal content, including child abuse online.
Ofcom revealed figures suggesting that over one in ten 11-18 year olds have been sent naked or semi-naked images.
This first draft code of practice published by Ofcom in its role enforcing the Online Safety Act covers activity such as child sexual abuse material (CSAM), grooming and fraud. 
It wants to hear what tech platforms think of its plans. 
Much of the guidance targets grooming. The largest platforms are expected to change default settings so children aren't added to suggested friends lists, something that can be exploited by groomers. 
They should also ensure children's location information cannot be revealed in their profile or posts and prevent them receiving messages from people not in their contacts list.
Depending on their size, type, and the risk they present platforms should also:
• Make sure moderation teams have the resources they need
• Make it easy to for people to make a complaint to the platform
• Remove accounts run by or on behalf of terrorist organisations
• Use keyword searches to find content linked to fraud such as stolen passwords
• Identify content containing the addresses of child abuse websites
• Search engines should not index websites previously identified as hosting child abuse material
• Search engine users should have a way to report ""search suggestions"" they believe are pointing them to illegal content.
Ofcom will also require some platforms to use a technology called hash-matching to detect CSAM.
This converts an image into numbers called a ""hash"", and compares that with a database of numbers generated by known CSAM images. If there is a match, then it means a known CSAM image has been found.
The method is already widely used by social media and search engines, according to Professor Alan Woodward of Surrey University.
""I fear Ofcom are simply codifying mechanisms that are already in use. It's not surprising as research to date has found nothing more effective than what is in use already"", he told the BBC. 
Private messages
But this hashing will not apply to private or encrypted messages. Ofcom stresses it is not - in this guidance - making any proposals that would break encryption.
Powers in the bill that could, if certain conditions are met, be used to force private messaging apps such as iMessage, WhatsApp and Signal to scan messages for CSAM have been deeply controversial.
These apps use end-to-end-encryption, which means even the tech firm cannot read the contents of the message.
Some major apps have said they will not comply if asked to scan encrypted messages - arguing it would require them to weaken the privacy of their systems globally, and weaken the security of systems that protect users including children.
Ofcom says those powers will not be consulted on until 2024 and are unlikely to come into force until around 2025.
Some question whether it will ever be possible to enforce these powers in a way that preserves the privacy of encrypted communications.
Asked in a BBC interview if those powers would ever be used, Ofcom's chief executive Dame Melanie Dawes said, ""it's hard to say right now, but there isn't a solution yet, a technology solution, that allows scanning to take place in encrypted environments without breaking the encryption.""
But she encouraged encrypted messaging companies to find ways to combat child abuse on their platforms.
Great expectations
The challenge facing Ofcom is significant. This first guidance is over 1,500 pages long. Over 100,000 services, many based outside the UK, may be subject to regulation. 
And government figures have suggested that 20,000 small business could need to comply.
Asked if Ofcom had the resources it needed, Dame Melanie admitted it was a ""really big job"" but added ""we're absolutely up for the task. And we're really excited that we're launching today.""
It faces another challenge managing expectations from the public and from campaigners. Whatever Ofcom announces it may be criticised for being too hard on tech platforms or not hard enough, said Dame Melanie.
""It isn't the job of a regulator to be loved by everybody. That's impossible.

The United States, the United Kingdom and more than a dozen other countries on Sunday unveiled what a senior US official described as the first detailed international agreement on how to keep artificial intelligence safe from rogue actors, pushing for companies to create AI systems that are “secure by design”.
In a 20-page document unveiled on Sunday, the 18 countries agreed that companies designing and using AI need to develop and deploy it in a way that keeps customers and the wider public safe from misuse.

The agreement is non-binding and carries mostly general recommendations such as monitoring AI systems for abuse, protecting data from tampering and vetting software suppliers.
Still, the director of the US Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, Jen Easterly, said it was important that so many countries put their names to the idea that AI systems needed to put safety first.
“This is the first time that we have seen an affirmation that these capabilities should not just be about cool features and how quickly we can get them to market or how we can compete to drive down costs,” Easterly said, adding that the guidelines represented “an agreement that the most important thing that needs to be done at the design phase is security”.
The agreement is the latest in a series of initiatives – few of which carry teeth– by governments around the world to shape the development of AI, whose weight is increasingly being felt in industry and society at large. The United Kingdom held a summit on AI late last month.
In addition to the United States and Britain, the 18 countries that signed on to the new guidelines include Germany, Italy, the Czech Republic, Estonia, Poland, Australia, Chile, Israel, Nigeria and Singapore.
The framework deals with questions of how to keep AI technology from being hijacked by hackers and includes recommendations such as only releasing models after appropriate security testing.
It does not tackle thorny questions around the appropriate uses of AI, or how the data that feeds these models is gathered.
The rise of AI has fed a host of concerns, including the fear that it could be used to disrupt the democratic process, turbocharge fraud or lead to dramatic job loss, among other harms.
Europe is ahead of the United States on regulations around AI, with lawmakers there drafting AI rules. France, Germany and Italy also recently reached an agreement on how artificial intelligence should be regulated that supports “mandatory self-regulation through codes of conduct” for so-called foundation models of AI, which are designed to produce a broad range of outputs.
The Biden administration has been pressing lawmakers for AI regulation, but a polarized US Congress has made little headway in passing effective regulation.

the_guardian,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/nov/27/meta-instagram-facebook-kids-addicted-lawsuit,"Instagram and Facebook parent company Meta purposefully engineered its platforms to addict children and knowingly allowed underage users to hold accounts, according to a newly unsealed legal complaint.
The complaint is a key part of a lawsuit filed against Meta by the attorneys general of 33 states in late October and was originally redacted. It alleges the social media company knew – but never disclosed – it had received millions of complaints about underage users on Instagram but only disabled a fraction of those accounts. The large number of underage users was an “open secret” at the company, the suit alleges, citing internal company documents.
In one example, the lawsuit cites an internal email thread in which employees discuss why a 12-year-old girl’s four accounts were not deleted following complaints from the girl’s mother stating her daughter was 12 years old and requesting the accounts to be taken down. The employees concluded that “the accounts were ignored” in part because representatives of Meta “couldn’t tell for sure the user was underage”.
The complaint said that in 2021, Meta received over 402,000 reports of under-13 users on Instagram but that 164,000 – far fewer than half of the reported accounts – were “disabled for potentially being under the age of 13” that year. The complaint noted that at times Meta has a backlog of up to 2.5m accounts of younger children awaiting action.
The complaint alleges this and other incidents violate the Children’s Online Privacy and Protection Act, which requires that social media companies provide notice and get parental consent before collecting data from children.
The lawsuit also focuses on longstanding assertions that Meta knowingly created products that were addictive and harmful to children, brought into sharp focus by whistleblower Frances Haugen, who revealed that internal studies showed platforms like Instagram led children to anorexia-related content. Haugen also stated the company intentionally targets children under the age of 18.
Company documents cited in the complaint described several Meta officials acknowledging the company designed its products to exploit shortcomings in youthful psychology, including a May 2020 internal presentation called “teen fundamentals” which highlighted certain vulnerabilities of the young brain that could be exploited by product development.
The presentation discussed teen brains’ relative immaturity, and teenagers’ tendency to be driven by “emotion, the intrigue of novelty and reward” and asked how these asked how these characteristics could “manifest . . . in product usage”.
Meta said in a statement that the complaint misrepresents its work over the past decade to make the online experience safe for teens, noting it has “over 30 tools to support them and their parents”.
With respect to barring younger users from the service, Meta argued age verification is a “complex industry challenge”.
Instead, Meta said it favors shifting the burden of policing underage usage to app stores and parents like Google and Apple, specifically by supporting federal legislation that would require app stores to obtain parental approval whenever youths under 16 download apps.
One Facebook safety executive alluded to the possibility that cracking down on younger users might hurt the company’s business in a 2019 email.
But a year later, the same executive expressed frustration that while Facebook readily studied the usage of underage users for business reasons, it didn’t show the same enthusiasm for ways to identify younger kids and remove them from its platforms.",tech
the_guardian,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/oct/30/pixel-8-review-googles-smaller-longer-lasting-android,"Google’s standard Pixel 8 gets a little smaller, faster and smarter, while lasting longer than the competition with seven years of updates.
The new Android costs £699 (€799/$699/A$1,199) – a £100 increase on last year’s model – but still undercuts the competition from Samsung and Apple, which cost about £800.
By shrinking a little compared with the outgoing model, the Pixel 8 has become one of the few smaller premium phones available. The 6.2in 120Hz OLED screen is bright, crisp and smooth while still being large enough for apps and video. The rounded aluminium sides and curved glass back feel nice and are easy to hold.

The phone has the same upgraded 2D face unlock system as the Pixel 8 Pro, with a fast and good under-display fingerprint scanner. It has Google’s latest Tensor G3 chip, which performed great at day-to-day tasks and handled games easily. The battery lasts slightly longer than its predecessor at about 36 hours between charges. It takes about 80 minutes to charge fully using a 30W power adaptor (not included), hitting 50% in less than 30 minutes.
Specifications
• Screen: 6.2in 120Hz FHD+ OLED (428ppi)
• Processor: Google Tensor G3
• RAM: 8GB
• Storage: 128 or 256GB
• Operating system: Android 14
• Camera: 50MP + 12MP ultrawide, 10.5MP selfie
• Connectivity: 5G, eSIM, wifi 7, NFC, Bluetooth 5.3 and GNSS
• Water resistance: IP68 (1.5m for 30 minutes)
• Dimensions: 150.5 x 70.8 x 8.9mm
• Weight: 187g
Android 14 with seven years of updates

The big upgrade for the Pixel phones this year is the promise of seven years of Android and security updates, meaning they will be safe to use until at least October 2030. Few others offers as long, bringing Google up to par with Apple’s iPhones – with only Fairphone providing longer at 10 years of support. Extended support means you can keep the phone longer and its resale value for the second- and third-hand market will probably be much higher.
Google has packed the Pixel 8 with many of its new generative AI features including various image and video editing tools, new abilities for its voice assistant and more promised in updates in the near future. For more on the Magic Editor and other features, please see the Pixel 8 Pro review.
Camera

The automatic macrophotography mode is a fun addition for the standard Pixel, allowing users to get detailed closeup shots of small things. Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/the Guardian
The Pixel 8 has the same excellent main camera as the 8 Pro, which includes a 2x optical zoom using the centre of the sensor. It is a big upgrade on predecessors, offering better low-light performance and faster, sharper shots. The 12MP ultra-wide camera is also solid and now used for a fun macrophotography mode for closeup shots of objects.
The Pixel 8 also gets most of the same generative AI tools as the 8 Pro including Best Take, Magic Editor and Audio Magic Eraser. But it lacks full manual control in the camera app and some more advanced features.
Overall, the Pixel 8’s camera is one of the best on the market but the lack of an optical zoom lens is disappointing.
Sustainability

Google does not provide an expected lifespan for the battery but it should last in excess of 500 full-charge cycles with at least 80% of its original capacity. The phone is repairable by Google and third-party shops, with genuine replacement parts to be available from iFixit soon. Out-of-warranty screen replacements from Google cost £66 and batteries £36.
The Pixel 8 is made with at least 18% recycled materials, including aluminium, plastic and tin. The company breaks down the phone’s environmental impact in its report. Google will recycle old devices free of charge.
Price
The Google Pixel 8 costs from £699 (€799/$699/A$1,199).
For comparison the Pixel 7a costs £449, the Pixel 8 Pro costs £999, the Samsung Galaxy S23 costs £849, the Fairphone 5 costs £649 and the iPhone 15 costs £799.
Verdict
The Pixel 8 is not quite the same smashing bargain its predecessors once were – that honour is now the realm of the Pixel 7a – but it still offers a lot of phone for the money.
The fit, finish and feel is top notch. The phone is responsive and smooth. The battery life is decent. The main camera is excellent but the lack of an extended optical zoom is slightly disappointing, even if it has been a similar formula for Google for several years.
The 6.2in screen moves the Pixel 8 closer to the underserved market of smaller but top-end phones, of which there are only a handful to choose from. Google’s generative AI features are certainly novel, but it is the extended seven-year software support that truly sets it apart.
It does not shine quite as bright as its bigger sibling but the Pixel 8 is still a great smaller phone worth looking at.
	Pros: seven years of software updates, good camera, great screen in smaller body, solid battery life, recycled aluminium, impressive local and generative AI features, undercuts rivals on price.
	Cons: price increase, no extended optical zoom for camera, 2D face unlock not as advanced as 3D scanners, raw performance short of best in class.",tech
forbes,https://www.forbes.com/sites/rashishrivastava/2023/11/21/openai-and-microsoft-sued-by-nonfiction-writers-for-alleged-rampant-theft-of-authors-works/?sh=3c7691e42994,"A new class action lawsuit was filed against OpenAI and Microsoft on Tuesday, alleging that the companies have trained AI chatbot ChatGPT and its later versions on copyrighted materials from nonfiction authors’ works and academic journals without their consent.
The lawsuit comes as OpenAI is in a state of turmoil, with its former CEO Sam Altman’s abrupt ouster and some 750 employees threatening to leave the company if Altman isn’t reinstated. The company’s investors are also considering suing OpenAI’s board of directors over the unraveling of events at the AI behemoth, according to a Reutersreport.
The lead plaintiff of the lawsuit is Julian Sancton, the New York Times-bestselling author of Madhouse at the End of the Earth: The Belgica’s Journey Into the Dark Antarctic. Sancton spent five years and tens of thousands of dollars traveling around the world to complete the research for the book, the lawsuit states. In response to a prompt, ChatGPT confirmed that Sancton’s book was a part of the dataset that was used to train the chatbot, according to the lawsuit filed by law firm Susman Godfrey LLP.
Sancton and thousands of other writers did not consent nor were compensated for the use of their intellectual property in the training of the AI, the lawsuit notes. Their complaint also highlights that Microsoft and OpenAI have commercialized their AI models, making billions of dollars in revenue through products like BingChat and ChatGPT Enterprise.
“Nonfiction authors often spend years conceiving, researching, and writing their creations. While OpenAI and Microsoft refuse to pay nonfiction authors, their AI platform is worth a fortune. The basis of the OpenAI platform is nothing less than the rampant theft of copyrighted works,” the lawsuit states.
This is yet another copyright-related lawsuit that OpenAI and Microsoft are currently facing. In September, famous literary figures like screenwriter Michael Chabon, journalist Rachel Louise Synder, fiction writer Matthew Klam and others filed a similar lawsuit against OpenAI for copyright infringement. In the past year, the company has also been sued by artists and creators for ingesting their works to train various AI systems to generate new types of content. However, this lawsuit is different from others in that it’s the first class action lawsuit related to ChatGPT that cites Microsoft as a defendant.
“Defendants’ models were calibrated (or “trained”) by reproducing a massive corpus of copyrighted material including, tens or hundreds of thousands of nonfiction books,” the lawsuit reads.
In response to previous similar copyright allegations, OpenAI has said that the content generated by ChatGPT does not constitute a “derivative work” and therefore doesn’t constitute a copyright infringement. Microsoft did not immediately respond to Forbes’request for comment and OpenAI declined to comment on pending litigation.",tech
forbes,https://www.forbes.com/sites/alexknapp/2023/11/22/this-startup-raised-38-million-to-fill-one-of-the-biggest-gaps-in-drug-discovery/?sh=54c7394a8d87,"Only about 10% of drugs in development ever make it to market. That number has remained largely unchanged since the early 1990s, despite milestone advances in science — genomics, automated systems for conducting experiments and artificial intelligence. One big reason: lab research models that can’t accurately capture how drugs will behave in an actual person. That’s something that needs to change as multiple failures are one big reason why it can potentially cost more than $2 billion to develop a single drug.
“These AI models are not creating drugs that are substantially better than human designed drugs,” Andrei Georgescu, CEO of Vivodyne told Forbes. That’s because, he explains, there’s simply not enough lab data for models to work with. That’s because before a drug goes to human trials, it’s mostly tested either on single cells or on animals, which gives scientists a good idea of how they work in those contexts, but not how they work in an actual patient. “The data that we have to build these drugs on and validate these drugs with is simply not translatable to the complexity of humans.”
That’s where Georgescu’s company, Vivodyne, comes in. It’s building human organ tissues in the lab that can be used for preclinical testing of potential drugs, as well as AI systems that can rapidly collect and analyze data from those tests. It’s a replacement, he said, for the large-scale, single cell lab models or animal testing that dominate the market today, which enable large-scale screening for treating infectious diseases or certain cancers, but they’re also labor intensive and not as useful for more complex diseases. On Wednesday, the company announced that it has raised a $38 million seed round led by Khosla Ventures. Bison Ventures, MBX Ventures, Kairos Ventures and CS Ventures also participated in the round.
Vivodyne’s technology was borne out of Georgescu’s research while working in the lab of Dan Huh, 49, at the University of Pennsylvania. Huh was one of the key researchers behind the first “organ on a chip,” a technology which has enabled scientists to build small scale models of biological systems for lab research. The two founded Vivodyne in the spring of 2021 in a “garage just off-campus from Penn,” Georgescu, 33, says.
Vivodyne’s key technological innovation, Georgescu says, is the ability to grow 22 different types of human tissue that can be used to model blood flow and other interactions between different parts of the body, rather than a single cell. What’s more, he said, Vivodyne’s systems don’t just grow normal red blood cells but also white blood cells and other cells that enable it to simulate immune responses, which gives researchers a better way to predict how they’ll behave in a live human.

VIVODYNE
In addition to growing models of organ systems, Vivodyne can also introduce those organs to different diseases, so that it’s possible to actually simulate how a drug might treat that disease. For example, Vivodyne can grow lung tissue, infect it with a respiratory disease, and then subject it to various treatments, cataloging the results. “So we’re able to generate clinical human data before clinical trials and before testing on real people,” he said.
What makes Georgescu's tissue models particularly promising is its scalability, which far exceeds current processes for growing tissue for academic research. There are “tens of thousands of these tissues we can grow at once,” he said. “With reproducibility and extremely tight control thanks to the full robotic automation of the process.”
Alex Morgan, a partner at Khosla Ventures, says it is precisely this scalability that most excites him about this investment. Not only does it hold promise for improving discovery of drugs, he told Forbes, it also provides useful data that machine learning systems can use to help biotech companies design better drugs. “There’s so much data being collected” that can be interpreted by AI systems, he said, that it will help Vivodyne be a huge driver for its customers.

Speaking of those customers, Georgescu says Vivodyne is already working with several companies both to assist in preclinical drug development and to troubleshoot disappointing results in human trials. With the new infusion of capital in this seed round, he told Forbes that Vivodyne will be able to develop more tissue systems for its platform, scale up its automation and build up its base of talent.
The overarching goal for his company, Georgescu said, is to turn it into the biological equivalent of a “large-scale data center” that provides scientists with unprecedented capabilities for researching human disease. “That is the future we’re working towards.”",tech

What is clickjacking?
Clickjacking is a trick where a malicious website tricks you into clicking on something different from what you think you're clicking on. Imagine you're trying to click on a button, to play a video, but instead, you're actually clicking on a hidden link that does something else, like sharing your personal information, downloading malware, transferring funds, or liking a page without you knowing. It's like a digital bait-and-switch.

euronews,https://www.euronews.com/next/2023/11/26/wikipedia-founder-jimmy-wales-says-ai-is-a-mess-now-but-can-become-superhuman-in-50-years,"Jimmy Wales tells Euronews Next about the ""terrible"" early stages of ChatGPT, the lesson for OpenAI, and about his open-source social media platform. 
ChatGPT, the wildly popular generative artificial intelligence (AI) tool from OpenAI, is currently a ""mess"" when it’s used to write articles on Wikipedia, the platform’s founder Jimmy Wales tells Euronews Next.
A Wikipedia article written today with ChatGPT-4 is ""terrible"" and ""doesn't work at all,"" he says, because it ""really misses out on a lot and it get things wrong, and it gets things wrong in a plausible way and it makes up sources and it's a mess"".
He even goes as far as to predict that superhuman AI could take at least 50 years to achieve.

But while he believes it is possible for AI to surpass humans in the distant future, it is more likely that AI tools will continue to support intellectual activities, despite being in an early phase at the moment, he says.
The most valuable start-up in the United States, OpenAI catapulted onto the scene with its chatbot ChatGPT last year.
The technology takes instruction and questions and answers them with an eerily human-like response based on sources it gathers online. It can be used for writing essays, song lyrics, or even health advice, though it can often get the information wrong, known as ""hallucinating"".
But even the most powerful chatbot AI start-up was thrown into chaos with the ousting of its CEO and co-founder Sam Altman last week and then his rehiring just days later after employees threatened the board they would quit en masse.
Wales said it is ""worrisome"" that this occurred for such an influential company but that it will ""probably pass as if nothing happened"".
ADVERTISING
If anything, he said the company will likely get its house in order and that it is ""a good lesson to start-ups of all kinds that you really do have to think even at a very early stage about governance, about the stability of decision making"".

Wikipedia and AI working together
Despite his criticism of current generative AI models, Wales has not ruled out AI being used for Wikipedia.
	It's a real problem and obviously we feel a heavy responsibility to the extent that the world depends on Wikipedia and AI models depend on Wikipedia.
 Jimmy Wales 
Founder, Wikipedia
He said if a tool were built to find mistakes in a Wikipedia article by comparing it to the sources it uses, it could help to iron out inaccuracies.
He even told Euronews Next that he would consider a Wikipedia venture with an open-source AI company that is freely usable to match Wikipedia’s principles, but clarified there is nothing specific in the works.
However, he says that this would be a decision that would not be taken lightly.
""Most businesses, not just charities like us, would say you have to be really, really careful if you're going to put at the heart of your business a technology that's controlled by someone else because if they go in a different direction, your whole business may be at risk,"" he said.
He would therefore think carefully about any partnerships but added that he was open to pilot programmes and testing models.
Wikipedia is still essential to generative AI as it sources information published online to produce content. Therefore, the online encyclopedia must be accurate and not produce bias, something that both AI and Wikipedia have been accused of.
	• Millions could be working a four-day week by 2033 thanks to AI, report claims
To create a gender balance and combat disinformation, Wikipedia has its own army of ""Wikipedians"" who are mostly male volunteer editors. Wales said that Wikipedians can see the difference between fake websites and can easily tell if the text was written by a human.
But bias is much harder to tackle as it can be historical; for instance, there were fewer female scientists in the 19th century and not much was written about them at the time, meaning Wikipedians cannot write that much about them. Or it can be unconscious bias, whereby a 28-year-old tech nerd Wikipedian may have different interests compared to a 55-year-old mother.
Diversity is key in trying to combat bias, something the company is striving to achieve.
""It's a real problem and obviously we feel a heavy responsibility to the extent that the world depends on Wikipedia and AI models depend on Wikipedia,"" he said.
""We don't want to teach robots to be biased, so we want to get it right as at the sort of the human heart of the whole thing"".
The beef with Elon Musk
Disinformation and online hate have been a grievance for Wales and one that has led to blows with the X (formerly Twitter) boss Elon Musk, who offered $1 billion (€915 million) for Wikipedia to change its name to ""Dickipedia"".
Wales has never responded to Musk’s comment as he said it did not need an answer. ""Everybody looks at that and says, ""Are you 12-years-old, Elon?'"" he told Euronews Next.
The $1 billion offer came after Wales criticised Musk for laying off moderation staff at X, which the Wikipedia chief said had increased all kinds of serious racism and toxic behaviour on the platform and is likely to affect advertising revenue.
	• The best AI tools to power your academic research
""You can't both run a toxic platform and expect advertisers to give you money, so that might change things,"" Wales said, adding that he and Musk are ""friendly"" and do text and that the exchanges are ""pleasant"".
He said he still uses X but has deleted the app from his phone, which has made his life ""much better"" as he can do other things that are less toxic.
His own social media experiment
Wales has launched his own social network platform which he says has a ""completely different"" approach to X.
	If you've got basically sensible people who have enough power, you'll get a basically sensible platform and there's always going to be somebody crazy.
 Jimmy Wales 
Founder, Wikipedia
Last week at Web Summit, Wales announced the beta version of his project called Trust Cafe, a new online community he says will give power to its most trusted members.
First revealed in September, he describes it as his experiment in a friendly and open-source social media platform that he is not taking too seriously as a business venture.
He called it a cross between X and Reddit, where you can discuss certain topics but are not limited to a certain number of characters and there is not one sole owner of a discussion.
""Reddit is both fantastic and horrible. Whereas we're really pursuing a model that's much more the governance is across everything,"" said Wales.
While he admits online hate and toxic behaviour will always occur within some users, he is optimistic.",tech
